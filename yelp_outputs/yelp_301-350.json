This is the place that inspired Harry Potter movie scenes and Lewis Carroll&apos;s Alice in Wonderland. I visited a professor or &quot;fellow&quot; and was given an exclusive tour. What an incredible place. I left feeling very stupid, uneducated and American. The professors at Oxford are brilliant, leagues beyond Harvard, Yale, or any American University. It opened my eyes to modern human intellectual greatness.",

This year there were six participating restaurants.  We had our dinner at Villaggio Grille who had teamed with Wagner Family Wines (Caymus).  Dinner was simply great.  Saturday afternoon is the wine and food tastings.  You give the ladies at entrance table your ticket (or show them your ticket on your phone) and you get a wrist band and a wine glass in return.  Then you head to the Rouse&apos;s tent where you get one of those plastic plates with a slot for your wine glass so you have a free hand to eat with.  Then you pile some of Rouse&apos;s food on your plate.  From there, you go from tent to tent, sampling food, wine, and some spirits.  One tent was dedicated to cooking demos from renowned chefs.  I won one of the items at the silent auction benefiting the Make A Wish foundation.  Happy about that.  There were several TVs set up so people won&apos;t miss the &apos;bama football game.  We had a good time and will probably try to come back next year.",

The building was brand-new, and the cleanliness of the building matched its newness. The hallways were long and wide to hold the presumably large student body. My only complaint would be the glass walls that separate the classroom from the hallways, as it could be a safety concern. Overall, Auburn High School definitely resonates as the future of education.",

However, I called to make the appointment before the GC expired, and was told that they would honor it anyway. A week before my appointment, I called to double check since I didn&apos;t want to be surprised by a higher price, and spoke to a different person who refused to honor the GC. I cancelled my appointment at that time. To my dismay, the day of my appointment, the sweet massage therapist called asking where I was since the woman on the phone had not actually cancelled my appointment. In the end, they lost money since they could have filled the empty schedule spot, and I lost a great massage. Incredibly disappointed with the customer service at what I heard was a place with the best massages in town.",

The dive shop itself has a huge show room and they even have their own pool with a 14 foot deep end.  The staff  are very friendly and extremely knowledgeable.  I got a private four dive session with full gear rental for less than $300.  Andrew was my instructor and is just a flat out super cool guy.  So much so that I&apos;m looking at going on one of their group dive trips mainly to dive with him again.  They even found a mask for my girlfriend who has been diving for years with mask issues.  I highly recommend them for people just getting into the sport or veterans alike.  Thanks again Andrew!!",

Bodenhamer has a ways to go.....front desk staff is rude and smug and God forbid you ask them to look up your membership in the event your forgot your card. Try to call in and schedule anything and you will be sent to a voicemail or told to go to the website. Equipment is nice, however the machines are on top of each other. Pool is very nice, when it is actually open and available for open swim. Classes are full of old people and not a very big selection of classes for younger more active/fit individuals. This gym definitely caters to the older crowd as they offer senior discounts. They cater to tourists and locals who won&apos;t pay for a full membership as they let anybody in for $5...good luck playing basketball because the gym is full of a bunch of rowdy thugs who just come and pay $5 when they want to play some pickup ball with a bunch of buddies (who aren&apos;t members either). We paid for a year up front or I would have already cancelled....",

Here&apos;s how that went: I wanted to do the family plan so my kids could have access to a gym and try to be healthier. I was told my 24 &amp; 26 year old kids had to have their own membership because of their ages. I was told I couldn&apos;t do the couple plan with my 24 year old because she&apos;s still considered too young. So she&apos;s too old to be a kid, but she&apos;s too young to be the other half of my couple? What&apos;s wrong with these people? What happened to a family friendly environment that encourages healthier lifestyles? They need to be more specific and put the rules in the fine print on the website. What does it matter how old your family is as long as I&apos;m paying the monthly fees for the family plan. What exactly do they consider family if you can&apos;t include your children in your family plan? Very disappointed. This place will never receive a penny of my money.",

I found the classes tailored to all abilities. My favorite class was yoga. Each instructor had something different to offer. This is a recreation department not a health club...bring your own yoga mat. If you plan to take a shower you will also need to bring a towel and hairdryer from home. The only improvement this facility could make is putting in more electrical sockets in the women&apos;s locker room. There is something for everyone to do here from young children to elderly.",

My 7 year old daughter sat in the front with him she was so excited it was her first time flying and it was a surprise birthday present for her. I&apos;ve went on a helicopter ride down here a few years ago and it was great the guy talked to us the whole time asked where we were staying so we could fly by and wave I&apos;ll be taking her there if we ever want to go again. When we got done she was like why didn&apos;t he say hi how are you or bye have a nice day i hope you enjoyed it when we got out that was awkward. i asked which way we were going and he told me left down the beach and across state park and thats the only thing he ever said. The lady that walks you to the helicopter was super nice and friendly.  Luckily my daughter still enjoyed it and it wasn&apos;t a total bust for her.",

The pilot (is adorable) is knowledgeable, gives competent instructions without terrifying you, then lifts you off of the tarmac before you can start to panic about being hoisted 500 feet off terra firma in a glass bubble glued to a beer can.  The panic lasts only a couple seconds, then ... OMG.  Just.  Wow.  It&apos;s a short trip around the Gulf Shores city, beach and state park.  The pilot loves his little neck of the woods and ADORES his machine.  He is happy to share info and explain intricacies of his aircraft.  And ...  drumroll .... you get to wear those cool headphones with microphones attached.  Do this tourist thing.  Its fun to go hang around the airport, too.  \\n\\nAFTERTHOUGHT:  It is not, in fact, a beer can.  It&apos;s an amazing, well-kept, well-loved flying machine.

All classes were online and any time I had a question, there was someone on the other end of the phone to help walk me through things. Shout out to my former advisor Luke who always took time to answer my questions. \\n\\n Not only does the curriculum and advising get five stars but so does graduation! It&apos;s a pretty awesome event where students from all over the world come together to celebrate.\\n\\nAdditionally, with respect to Safety degrees and careers, this school always represents at conferences and conventions in the industry. I know I can stop by their exhibitor booth and say hi. Everyone is friendly and helpful and they always put together great networking events to help current students and alumni meet other people in the field. Paul and Ernie- you are both awesome to say hello to during NSC and ASSP conferences.\\n\\nHow could I almost forget about graduation?!? People from all over the world coming together to celebrate. The staff put on an amazing event and I met some people that I am still friends with! Definitely a must when you finish your degree. Make the weekend into a fun beach vacation to celebrate.\\n\\nIf you are on the fence in deciding whether or not to further your education at CSU, I can tell you that my experience was amazing and I will go back when I am ready to get another degree!",

Online schooling is a challenge as one needs to think outside the box and sometimes be a mind reader of what their professors might be looking for.  I recieved both my BS and MBA at Columbia Southern University and learned confidence in areas and schools of thought that I did not have before.  The courses will challenge you and the college is at a great price.  And before any of you go running away at the challenge, remember that the challenge is what you learn from and need to overcome.  In many of the programs you will learn more than your education, and will find a staff that has your success in mind.  The extra things I learned were patience, professionalism, and the courage to seek clarity like a pro and within academic policies and chains of command.  They are flexible and even had life flexible terms that you can choose from.  Although only a nationally accredited institution and a member of the Distance Education and Training Council, they are as of 2022 under review for being regionally accredited. \\n They also have an alumni association that students can be recommended to.  Check them out.  Good luck to all of you on your degree pursuits, and good luck to CSU on becoming regionally accredited.  ~Sincerely, a CSU Knight Ambassador.",

I really hope they get Regional Accreditation soon so their credits will transfer and be recognized at a higher level.  They are currently Nationally Accredited by the DEAC, the same accreditation as the &quot;free&quot; college, University of the People.  I put quotes around free because at UoP, the online courses are free but the final exams are $100 to take and receive credit for the course. \\n\\nFrom what I was told by my advisor at CSU, they are working diligently towards a Regional Accreditation sometime in the near future.\\n\\nOnce that is achieved I will highly recommend this school. In the meantime, I can definitely say I like their platform and I like where they are going!",

My counselor didn&apos;t bother to guide me as the school  instructed and truly went into deaf ears. My Masters Degree was awesome with Richard Beatty as my counselor. Just be very careful this school uses tokenism lots and lie. Don&apos;t care about the student and if your not a match they play one as stupid. I even had a professor say ,&quot;Your in the wrong class, go back to junior college.&quot; Well I am in the University. I was humilated, disrespected and harrassed. Now I found a better place.

So I was enrolled in the fire science program and had to take time off came back to finish my degree and they changed it to fire administration and had to take one more class than needed before. Unfortunately I was unable to get back into the program and finish. I start up again take a class and unfortunately personal issues come up again. Try again to finish and sign up a week ago, I needed to be &quot;reevaluated&quot; and even though nothing changed and I was still going for the same degree they screwed me over and instead of 24 credit to graduate now I need 30 and they are not even for anything good just a math and humanities class. Really?? And no one has helped me just basically said that&apos;s the way it is. Hate this place no help and I wasted so much time effort and money on this scamming bunch of people saying they are for education. Hope they go out of business because they only care about your money. Go somewhere else because no matter what you want to do there is another college that will be much better.",

            "description": "Columbia Southern University is an excellent university. I have to disagree with the person who said that this college is as easy as or easier than high school. Yes, most of the work you submit is essays; however, that is the challenging part.  The coursework is very rigorous. I have attended both a b&amp;m college as well as CSU, so I can attest that this college is definitely harder. You can&apos;t plagiarize essays because they use Turn It In for many of the classes and major points are deducted if the redundancy rate is too high. I have had this happen, even when none of my material was plagiarized. So, I had to learn to use more of my own words and and not quote so much material. If you can easily write essays, you might consider this university easy. However, if you struggle with writing and thoughts don&apos;t come as easily to you, like me, then you might have a different view of this school. In one class alone, I had to write 18 essays. It would be much easier to have multiple choice, like I did in high school or like I did when I went to my b&amp;m college.  However, I will say that I have retained more information through my coursework at CSU than I have at any other school. I retain more information when I have to write than when I have to just memorize information for a short term. There is no extra credit or making up assignments. If you don&apos;t do the work, you will not get a good grade. I would recommend this university to any working adult who does not have time to go to college the traditional way. If you enjoy independent learning and don&apos;t have to be in a classroom,  you will like CSU.  I am a senior at CSU, graduating this year. I do not feel like my degree is being handed to me; I have worked hard for the degree that I will receive. This journey has been more time consuming and stressful than I could have ever imagined, but well worth it!",

But it is worth making the 15 minute trek from High Street, as the college was designed and built in the 1960s by the prominent Danish designer and architect Arne Jacobsen. While it is, unfortunately, not possible to admire the interior features, all of which were also the work of Jacobsen, if you are not a student, the college is a so called open college, meaning that there is 24 hour access to the quad (rather unusually for Oxford, this is a round piece of grass). From here, you can explore the amazing architecture and interesting gardens. Do avoid the new blocks, however, as these are a bit of an eye-sore despite the claim that their design was based on that of Jacobsen.",

The dining hall is in a light-coloured wood and very well-lit, so it feels very welcoming whilst still retaining its grandness.\\n\\n\\n Hertford&apos;s proximity to the Bodleian library makes it an excellent place to pop into for a view of a typical college whilst on the tourist trail.",

To be honest, the interior of the college is very similar to many of the other Oxford colleges, but make sure you get some snaps of the bridge! The Sheldonian theatre, Old Bodleian and Radcliffe Camera are very close by.",

            "description": "Trinity is one of the quintessential Oxford colleges. Not quite as grand as Christchurch or Magdalen, it is perhaps in a slightly more central location and is right near where some of the walking tours of Oxford start. The great thing about Trinity is that it&apos;s surrounded by iron railings, so you can see into it without having to pay.\\n\\n\\n Despite being near the centre of town, it&apos;s got a surprising amount of open space in it, with several large quads, the standard beautiful Oxford gardens and even a patch of woodland, which makes a refreshing change from the very obviously cultivated grass.\\n\\n\\n The chapel is reputedly the first neoclassical one of its kind, partly designed by Christopher Wren (who also designed St. Paul&apos;s Cathedral). The West tower shows the college&apos;s age. The statues on top represent astronomy, theology, medicine and geometry - perhaps the main subjects when the college was founded.\\n\\n\\n The buildings are old and grand. If you get a chance to look round, the dining hall is very pretty, with portraits and old wooden benches and tables. The college also has a squash court hidden away near the dining hall. Access is annoying because of the electronic gate system, but the porters are very friendly. There are two porters&apos; windows: as far as I can tell, one is for students and the other for visitors, but I get it wrong every time!",

It&apos;s actually a series of 39 smaller colleges, each with their own separate campuses and facilities and educational specialties -- one of those colleges being named St. Johns.  But let&apos;s be honest here, you don&apos;t really want to tell new acquaintances and potential employers that you studied at St. John&apos;s College for the summer, you want the reaction you get from telling them you studied at Oxford.  And therefore, the misconception continues...\\n\\nI had a great time studying here, although I won&apos;t comment too much on the curriculum or teachers, since I was a part of specialized summer program.  However, the grounds were well kept and immaculate.  The architecture was historic and gorgeous...and the dorm rooms were crazy big.  At least mine was...I had so much damn space in that room, it was like I had a studio apartment all to myself.  There&apos;s a pub on campus, that&apos;s pretty spacious and well stocked, and there&apos;s a few kebab vans on the street near campus that serve late night greasy stuff, including the very popular cheesy chips (i.e.  fries).  1am food for drunkards....UK style.",

There is also a tiny pub tucked away in front of the dining hall that serves a beer specifically made for Christ Church College. \\n\\nThe Tom Quad, their central grounds, is well kept and expansive - more open and palatial than the other colleges.

For about 1200 pounds, you get room, full board and tuition in a course of your choosing (you couldn&apos;t stay in Oxford for a week with all meals alone for that...). Courses range from King Arthur and Jane Austen to the Beatles and murder mysteries; you are sure to find something fascinating. But the real star is Christ Church (you don&apos;t say College, just Christ Church, and its nickname is &quot;the House&quot;). Buildings that date from many centuries back, that you actually live in for a week, and you take three meals a day in the dining hall up the staircase they used in the Harry Potter movies. Awesome. I was so disappointed that Dumbledore wasn&apos;t there presiding over the high table. But it was terrific. Such history. And the best part was being there after the college gates were shut and locked and you were on the inside. The place was yours to wander around...fantastic. But if you can&apos;t do the program for a week, at least visit for the day.",

Many in the UK are not worth visiting, but Oxford really has a lot to offer non-students in the way of tours, access to campus grounds, libraries, chapels, museums, and more. There is enough here to warrant at least two full days of exploration. We went on the college grounds of about six or so different colleges, which comprise Oxford University. Each is unique with its own gardens, traditions, and quirks. For walking tours, we did Footprints Tours (an independent group). \\n\\nMany of the colleges charge a small admission fee to walk onto their quad (grounds) while others ban visitors altogether. It just depends. Since they are all clustered together, you can explore them easily at your leisure.",

            "description": "The history of Oxford is a bit over whelming. There were many famous government, playwrites, economists, and leaders that are alumni dating back to the 13th century. It is one of oldest English University made up of many sub colleges. This also a town that is possibly one of the most expensive areas to live. There is a big Oxford and Cambridge rivalry similar to the US version of Princeton and Harvard or maybe Brown. \\n\\nDon&apos;t quote me on historical accuracy. I sound like a bloody Yankee from across the pond. I am very new to the English culture. The casual dress is more refine than California and everyone speaks in proper English. I must really speak slowly and try not to use too many slang words or American idioms. The first night on the town my group ran in to a local Oxford curling team and we got a picture and I said the word awesome. They laughed because I&apos;m sure I sound like a Ninja Turtle to them. I was taught the word Mate! As a cool lingo. Socal represent! Speaking of Southern California  I will always use the word &quot;hella&quot; and get a similar odd reaction.\\n\\nI find visiting the Rewerly House for a study Abroad Program great so far. It is only day 2, I work up for an early 6am morning walk in the 36 degrees Fahrenheit whether it is so worth it and beautiful. A bit chilly for me, but a great way to cure Jet Lag and a night on the town visiting many local pubs. It is free of smog with unlimited drinkable clean water. It is the opposite of California. We had a 4 year drought we don&apos;t have a winter. Temperature ranging from 60 to 80 degrees year round. \\n\\nI cannot wait to learn from one of the most prestigious University in England. I will not reference Harry Potter but I am in the right place. I hope to expand my knowledge and meet more locals.\\n\\nCheero!",

            "description": "Oxford University...admire it or loathe it, it&apos;s undeniably famous and one of the main reasons people visit Oxford. It&apos;s inextricably tied up with the layout of Oxford: the magificent old buildings, the traditions, the culture and many of the inhabitants are related to the university and its spin-off education centres, shops and attractions.\\n\\n\\n It&apos;s the oldest university in the English-speaking world, dating back to the 11th century. In England its main rival is Cambridge, which was actually set up by some Oxford students in the 13th century. It remains one of the leading universities in the world for teaching and for research, and combines the old with the new.\\n\\n\\n Many people come to Oxford thinking there is one set area called &apos;Oxford University&apos;. In fact, the university is a myriad of buildings, consisting mainly of colleges (there are around 30), which are semi-independent entities like schools with their own traditions, accommodation, libraries (especially the Bodleian) and teaching. There are also libraries, chapels, museums, music rooms and theatres, as well as administrative centres. Many of the buildings are really old, with amusing gargoyles on, towering steeples (Oxford is known as &apos;the city of dreamy spires&apos;) and are sites where great literary, political and scientific figures throughout history made various discoveries and creations.\\n\\n\\n Nowadays the university is more active than ever and it&apos;s worth popping along during term time to see students wearing their gowns (which some of them wear to dinner, and all to exams), academics in full academic dress on their way to various ceremonies, and to watch the rowing and punting, both of which Oxford is famous for. There are some famous students, such as the actress who plays Hermione in Harry Potter and Bilawal Bhutto, son of murdered Benazir Bhutto. Oxford students are stereotypically rich, public school educated and very intelligent. In reality, there is a good mix of people from different backgrounds, but there&apos;s still a high proportion of pashminas, chinos, V-neck jumpers and modern-day Einsteins.",

As sad as I am that OCOC will never happen again in this venue (if ever), I am very happy I made it to the very last one.\\n\\nJesus College is absolutely stunning, and I am so happy that I had the honor to stay here for a night. My dorm room in Building #17 (which had libraries in the buildings, and dorm rooms on the 3rd and 4th floor) was wonderful, with two rooms! One rather large room with a desk and a wardrobe, and a second room with a bed, drawers, and a bedside table. There was a bonus room: a private bathroom complete with a private shower! They also provided towels, and like a hotel, complimentary shampoo, conditioner, and soap, in a little Jesus College baggie that I was more than happy to take home. Both main rooms also had large windows that opened up, complete with a gorgeous view overlooking Oxford, complete with a gargoyle next to my window. Being neighbors with the Radcliffe Camera and Bodleian Library, I really felt as though I was looking out from a window in Hogwarts.\\n\\nThe main rooms where the panels and workshops were hosted for our conference were the Habakkuk Room and the Periodicals Room. We also had the JCR for our welcome talk, tea breaks, corset show and tells, and closing talk. We also had complimentary meals (breakfast, lunch, AND dinner!) and ate in a gorgeous dining hall that felt like a miniature of the Hogwarts Great Hall. The food was delicious and beautifully presented as well. One of my favorite desserts were the slices of pistachio cakes with rose frosting that was offered during lunch. Oh, so lovely! My taste buds were in Heaven.\\n\\nThe staff was incredibly kind and helpful too. At one point, I accidentally left my key card in my room, and locked myself out of my room. I went to the front desk, and they were so helpful in getting me a new key card that I could use as soon as lunch was over. Thank you so much, staff! Check in and check out was quick and easy too.\\n\\nAlthough I am sad OCOC will never happen here again, I am happy that I had the experience to BE here, to marvel over the beauty of Jesus College, to sleep here, explore the halls, eat here, and connect with a community of some of the the world&apos;s most skilled and dedicated corset enthusiasts. What happy memories. Thank you, Jesus College, for being the home for Oxford Conference of Corsetry.",

It is a small College, founded by Elizabeth I in 1571 (the only Elizabethan college in Oxford). The first quad contains the chapel, which is small but has wonderful stained glass in the east window and also a bust of Lawrence of Arabia, one of the college&apos;s most famous old member. The Principal&apos;s Lodgings, which has a distinctive shell porch over the door, is also in this quad. The entrance to the Hall is off the passage through to second quad. The Hall contains portraits of some of the college&apos;s benefactors and famous old members, including ex-Prime Minister Harold Wilson. Second quad has a marvelous wisteria on one of the walls, so be sure to check this out if you are visiting in May. Many people, like me, think Jesus is one of the prettiest colleges in Oxford.",

It&apos;s an expensive school, but the experience is exactly what you want college to be: lots of things to do (activities, clubs), lots of music, art, interesting people, close proximity to the city, and great guest lectures (Temple Grandin, for example was amazing).\\n\\nThe Art of Teaching program was wonderful. The professors help you develop what I&apos;ll call a golden confidence that allows you to keep your sanity in the face of challenging elementary school administrations/teacher evaluations. Since graduating, I have landed jobs working at public, charted, and private schools. Many schools recognize an SLC diploma as something very valuable and unique; for good reason. I can&apos;t stress enough the great experience I had while attending this school, and I recommend it to anybody who wants a well-rounded education.",

            "description": "Oh, Sarah Lawrence, how I love thee. I went to school there from September &apos;86 to May &apos;90, and I received a BA in Liberal Arts. I believe my SLC experience has made my life far richer and more interesting.  If you went to a fabulous high school (I didn&apos;t), then it might not seem so revolutionary (mine was pretty lame). FYI, I studied creative writing, economics, Italian, and art history. \\n\\nSLC tends to be a place that people either love or hate. There are way more of the former or it wouldn&apos;t still be around. I&apos;ll try to address the issues in a pros and cons format. \\n\\n**Pros:** \\n--SLC has an extremely low (= great) student-to-faculty ratio (it was 6:1 when I was there). The vast majority of classes are seminars, which have a maximum of 15 students sitting around the table with their professor. Most of my classes had 6-10 students and I only had one lecture class my entire undergraduate education (that&apos;s typical, by the way). A student pretty much can&apos;t be invisible at SLC--there&apos;s no where to hide (in class anyhow!). \\n\\n--The conference system is completely amazing.Students get to meet with each of their professors one-on-one every other week and in those meeting they design their own class that they pursue by themselves with the professor&apos;s guidance. Those bi-weekly conferences with my professors were simultaneously terrifying and completely (eventually) ego-boosting. Sometimes I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d have anything intelligent to say (especially first year), but I gained confidence in myself over time. An example of a conference topic that came out of a seminar was my study of how England held back Ireland&apos;s economic development in the 1800s. I did that topic with Professor Mieke Meurs my freshman year, while I took her class, &quot;Political Economy of Developing Nations.&quot; \\n\\n--Amazing professors. From Grace Paley to Alan Gurganus to Joseph Campbell, SLC has incredible people teaching in the classrooms. And folks don&apos;t go to SLC to publish, they have to want to teach. \\n\\n--The don system: Patterned on Oxford College&apos;s don system, SLC puts first-year students into small classes taught by a professor who will be their guide/mentor/don for all their years at SLC. It&apos;s a special relationship. \\n\\n--Great study-abroad programs: I spent my junior year in Florence, Italy. Wow--what an experience. I highly recommend the program. There are also great programs in Paris and Oxford (and probably some new ones--check out the SLC web site). I studied studio art, Italian language, Italian theater history, and Italian literature that year.\\n\\n--Creative freaks can get their freak on here: For folks who didn&apos;t hit their peak in high school (non-Homecoming Queen types, etc.) and have a strong creative/independent streak, this is a great place to go. (There are tons of writers, dancers, artists, musicians, etc., here.) This could obviously be a Pro or a Con--for me it was great. I dressed in black, shaved my head, and fantasized about being the next Sylvia Plath. It was a safe space for me to be weird-ish during my early adulthood and has made me so much more comfortable with all sides of myself and all kinds of people. Why be normal?--especially during college! \\n\\n**Cons:** \\n--It&apos;s a very expensive school (it was second most-expensive when I went there, after Bennington). Unfortunately, SLC doesn&apos;t have a large endowment (I do my part--I give every year--really!) Also, because it has a low ( = great) student-to-faculty ratio (I think it was 6:1 when I was there), it spends a fortune on faculty salaries. I put myself through school, which was pretty brutal--I worked very hard in the summers and P/T during the school year and took out loans and got grants. I managed to pay off the loans in good time. It was well worth it for me.\\n\\n--There are no fraternities or sororities at SLC. (That&apos;s actually a pro for me, but I sneak it in here!)\\n\\n--It&apos;s not a big &quot;team sports&quot; school. When I was there the crew team was doing really well, but there&apos;s no football or basketball team or any &quot;big&quot; sports teams. There is a kick-ass sports facility there now--that&apos;s new since I went to SLC (I am so jealous!).  \\n\\n--People spend a lot of time in NYC (it&apos;s 20 minutes away) and many upperclassmen live in the city and commute so there can be a pull for students between the campus and the city. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s much of a con, though.",

It was challenging yet nurturing, and I left it an entirely different person than I was when I first walked onto its leafy, lofty, black-squirrel infested campus. I started my time at SLC at the tail end of a very difficult period in my life, and although I didn&apos;t quite realize it at the time, this place was a soothing balm.  When I graduated two years later, I was more sure of myself, my writing and my place in the world than I&apos;d ever been before, and I was exposed to all kinds of literature that my traditionalist self had never read before. I was a book snob, and not in a good way. \\n\\nThe faculty are absolutely wonderful, the classrooms are safe havens of constructive criticism, and the conference system is great. I rarely had the opportunity to actually talk to my professors in college - I always got the sense that I was somehow annoying them, at least the upper echelon ones - but that&apos;s not the case at SLC. Your teachers want to talk to you about your work, your life and the way your view of the world influences both. It&apos;s so nice to feel as though you matter as a student. \\n\\nMy outlook on the campus is kind of bittersweet, and that&apos;s mainly bound up in my internal host of regrets that I didn&apos;t get to go here for undergrad - I begged my parents but they wouldn&apos;t let me apply because they told me that they couldn&apos;t afford it (which was probably true - SLC is one of the most expensive schools in the country). I guess that they didn&apos;t want me to be disappointed if I got in and they couldn&apos;t send me. \\n\\nBut all that really matters is that I got to SLC eventually. When I graduated with my M.F.A., my parents couldn&apos;t stop praising the campus, the warmth of the graduation ceremony and the quality of the speakers. My mom told me that if she had to do it all over again, she and my father would have found a way to send me to SLC for college. If that isn&apos;t a testament to the quality of SLC, then nothing is, my friend. You know when you belong someplace. If you have the opportunity to go to SLC, take it. It will change and brighten your life.",

This was my dream school and even though few people supported me, I got in.\\n\\nAs of Friday, I can officially say goodbye....\\n\\n\\nI had many ups and downs with SLC in the 2.5 years I went there, but right now as I write this review I&apos;m getting teary-eyed remembering all of the great moments I had there.  Even though I don&apos;t have my degree from SLC, I know I&apos;m not going to regret any of my student loans.  \\n\\nI&apos;m currently finishing up my degree back home and all I can say is, THANK YOU SARAH LAWRENCE!  I&apos;m in a program similar to SLC, but it&apos;s just not the same.  The donning system...well it&apos;s one of the best things about this school.  I remember when I thought I&apos;d take computer programming as a freshman and 3 weeks later realized I was going to crumble and needed to get out.  I&apos;m freaking out in my don&apos;s office and say something to the extent of &quot;I don&apos;t care what I take as long as it&apos;s not religion&quot; and he replies with, &quot;wait, now let&apos;s talk about that.&quot;  What do ya know, I end up in a religion class that I absolutely loved.  \\n\\nHere are some of the reasons I fell in love with SLC:\\n\\nKomozi Woodard - I met him when I visited the campus as he was my host&apos;s don and I knew at that moment that I needed to come here and take one of his classes.  His class is the only one I&apos;ve ever kept all of the books I had to buy.  Our conference time was the last of the day and we almost always went over by at least a half an hour.  I always looked forward to the stories he&apos;d tell in relation to the class discussion and I&apos;m so happy that I was able to take one of his classes.  \\n\\nSLC&apos;s ECC - Whenever I would send out my resume, this is frequently the first thing interviewers ask about.  I remember finding out I was going to be with the 2-year-olds and thinking &quot;but I work better with 4 and 5 year olds&quot;.  This &quot;job&quot; is what really solidified that I was pursuing the right career path.  \\n\\nThe psychology department - Look at how many faculty members are in this department.  I bet it&apos;s a lot more than you would have thought.  Most people focus on taking writing classes, theater or dance (and with good reason), but not me.  My don (a member of this department) had to sit me down and tell me to start taking classes in other departments before I ended up not being able to take any psychology class.\\n\\nThe campus - It&apos;s gorgeous and small.\\n\\n\\n\\nI finally requested my official transcripts be sent to my new school and it was a bittersweet moment for me.  I am so close to graduating and I finally realized the extent of what I gained from coming here.  I remember sitting in a class freshman year when I piped up with, &quot;I feel like I haven&apos;t learned anything.  When am I ever going to get to put this information to use?&quot;  Moments later, everyone else said the same thing, but before I knew it I was bringing in material from previous classes to back up what I said in another one.  If there&apos;s one thing I should have done, it was those worksheets.  It would have made backing up my points a LOT easier.  Oh well, lesson learned.  \\n\\nThank you Sarah Lawrence, for everything.  Even the 9:30am classes that were at the bottom of the hill.",

I had a several classes one with Sara Saffian and one with a professor who was absent for moth of the semester because  of family issues.\\nFirst and foremost the Writing Institute pulls people from the surrounding areas who have been out of the classroom for many years and it often results in, at least in Saffian&apos;s class, little to no classroom control.  It was not like any college class I had ever experienced.\\n\\nBeyond students in the classroom stating that they did not agree with something and discussing the logistics of homework in class, I found Saffian to be lacking in ability to be helpful and insightful of student work and somewhat rude.\\n\\nThe other instructor was great, although absent most of the semester.\\n\\nI think it may be hit or miss and if your interested before you sign up for a class read the reviews in rate my prof on each instructor.",

            "description": "Dear young 18-whatever age year olds considering (or not considering) Sarah Lawrence,\\n\\nI wrote a no holds barred, name naming review/guide to Sarah Lawrence on Epinions and I would like you to read it.  http://www.epinions.com/review/educ-Colleges_and_Universities-All-Sarah_Lawrence_College/content_497328098948?sb=1\\n\\nDuring my time at Sarah Lawrence, I amassed a lot of knowledge about the school.  To start, Sarah Lawrence is not a (creative) writing school, neither is it a school for the &quot;creative arts,&quot; poetry, theater, music, or dance.  Other untrue ideas: It is not all girls, but rather has a 70:30 female to male ratio which is even harder for women than all girls schools, believe it.  Neither is it particularly dark and gothic (despite the &quot;even the squirrels wear black&quot; t shirts, that died in the 90s along with the heroin era)... Hipster is the new stereotype visible around campus, neither was it as activist/feminist as portrayed, unfortunately (It was a more lax/apathetic time in 2004-2008, I hope that is changing now.)\\n\\nIt is a liberal arts school, academic in nature, for those who want to have the freedom to study different subjects in great depth without a required core curriculum or a major, i.e. delve into Literature, Urban Development, and Biology at the same time.  Its strongest subjects and professors are all informational and academic in nature, regardless of whether it is in social sciences, humanities, or even physics.  \\nIt is also for those who want small (15 person) seminars and need a discussion in class/personal contact with an eccentric and phenomenal professor.  \\n\\nIf you are a self motivated person who likes to steer their own learning and challenge their own self, you will derive maximum benefit if you can also integrate what a professor tells you into your thought process, if you are a rabidly interested, but somewhat unsure person, you will still reap value from Sarah Lawrence.\\n\\nDo you know why the 15 person seminars, conference work with professors (meeting with your professor every two weeks and developing a written or non-written thesis) are its strongest sell?  Because the PROFESSORS are why you will stay.  After the lonely lack of available men, love/hate attitudes of &quot;one foot in and one foot out&quot; negativity on campus toward the school, hard social life, inept administration, clunky academic structure, doubtful application to the professional world, the elite level squad of Sarah Lawrence professors (hopefully supplemented by your own motivation to steer your education&apos;s course) will give you the mind expanding education you never dreamed of and protect you from the various problems and inequities.  \\n\\nSarah Lawrence has a cadre of many great, most good, few mediocre, and even fewer bad professors that you will want to get close to.  They will enthrall you, change your understanding, infuriate you, rearrange your mind, and impress you with their brilliance, craziness, prickliness, and caring.  Most people can count on their fingers the amount of great teachers they&apos;ve had in their life.  I overstep 15.  \\n\\n(Incidentally, the Oxford program study abroad is also a selling point for the rigorous academic training the PROFESSORS give one on one.  It is a valuable experience and a crucible.)\\n\\nIn my epinions guide, I wrote my thoughts on what professors I particularly recommend.  Those that are feted all stars with years of reputation who understand the system and love to teach students.  Put your ear to the ground.  I think that the humanities, particularly the literature department, are the strongest because they have the best great to good professor ratio and most variety of subjects.  (Addendum: Sara Rudner for dance.)  \\n\\nOne thing I will tell you is that if you are not careful, SLC will IN NO WAY teach you the creative problem solving, logic, and entrepreneurial ideation skills you need to synthesize, create, or learn something completely new at work.  Every work environment presents new problems.  No one can teach that.  Problem solving and analytical skills not related to those in writing are just as creative (i.e. the tech boom).  Neither will you have the resources to learn professional writing like cover letters.  But, life eventually teaches people who leave the nest the skills they need to get by or perish and college isn&apos;t leaving the nest.  Self starting, flexibility to change, leading and managing people, etc.  Some schools teach the bare minimum to survive in a job and this is a disservice to the 18-25 year old growing brain, but here a student can pitch a no-hitter in terms of education (wow, baseball metaphors.) \\n\\nFew people know what they want to do at 18, (why people change majors) but, with a strategic course load, professor guidance, and meaningful internships, you can carve out a path of a career that also appeals to your passions.  SLC experience is valued in the workplace, whose values are even more unexpected than you think.",

            "description": "Sarah Lawrence is not at all what it seems to be. I transferred after my first year because it was so bad; it&apos;s really going downhill. Here are my reasons why I think anyone should steer clear of such a school:\\n1. The administration sucks. They do not care about any student, or situation. If you need help, they are not going to make it better. I was in the big party dorm when I first arrived, and my RA was smoking weed and drinking right inside our apartment! I tried to switch rooms to a different dorm, and the administration didn&apos;t get around to it until after the first semester was over! I then told them I had to be in a smoke/drink-free room, and the roommate they gave me smoked pot every night with the window closed. \\n2. Everyone does every drug. They do pot outside on the lawn and in all dorms. Cocaine and heroine are done in the bathrooms and dorm rooms, ecstasy is taken at all the parties, and in the first semester alone there were over 10 near-deaths of students because of this. You think then that security or administration would try and crack down on it, right? Wrong.\\n3. Everyone smokes. There is supposed to be rules and limits on smoking, but none of that is followed. People will stand right in the middle of walkways and right outside of doors so there is no escaping the smoke. My biggest problem was they stood up against dorm buildings (when they&apos;re supposed to be 50 feet away) and I couldn&apos;t leave my windows open (even in the heat) or the disgusting smell of cigarette smoke would get in. Students roll their cigarettes in class and the teachers don&apos;t care either. \\n4. The parties are horrible. There are no fun dancing parties. A party at Sarah Lawrence consists of depressing music and people sitting around doing drugs together. If you call security to shut it down, they don&apos;t care one bit. I&apos;ve seen a security guard walk into a dorm room where everyone was binge drinking and smoking pot, and just laughed and told them to keep it down.\\n5. There is no sense of community. Everyone is very cliquish or a complete loner. There are no big campus wide events or sororities/frats, and the school is famous for &quot;Sarah-Lawrencing,&quot; which means ignoring someone when they say hi to you. People are rude to you, and if you don&apos;t drink or do drugs you get alienated. I felt so alone during my time there, and after speaking with others I&apos;ve realized that many people get extremely depressed from the isolating environment.\\n6. There are so many weirdos. I&apos;m sorry, but it&apos;s true. A lot of people seem to have personality disorders, and others just seem plain psychotic. It is not a normal, educated environment whatsoever. \\n7. Hill House is terrible. It&apos;s the main dorm for freshman, but it is about a 20 minutes walk from campus, right on the highway. There are people who live there who do not go to the school, but are residents of Yonkers and are extremely sketchy. This apartment complex is a party house with music and sex 24/7; there is always noise and smoke and filth everywhere. And it&apos;s so far from campus it&apos;s ridiculous! \\n8. The president doesn&apos;t care about anything. She turns a blind eye to all the problems with drugs and drinking and smoking and bullying, and pretends that nothing is wrong and that her school is perfect and running just as she wants it to be. When anyone approaches her with problems they have, she acts like we&apos;re making it up or just trying to ruin the school&apos;s reputation ourselves. \\n9. There are very few options to study. Everyone their first year is required to take a First Year Study, but people seldom get their first choice, and end up in a class that they hate. This happens a lot with other classes too; a majority of people get bumped and don&apos;t get to study what they want. Also, for creative writing students, there are very few good classes, even though that&apos;s for what the school is supposed to be known. For history majors, this school has only classes on modern history; there are no classes dealing with anything pre-1900s. \\n10. There&apos;s no major, and what&apos;s more, there aren&apos;t even real concentrations. For your three classes for the first 2 years, you are not allowed to take more than one class in one subject. Which sucks, because if you&apos;re interested in English, you can only take one English class, and your other two have to be in, like, history and science, or history and physiology...\\n11. The teachers are very brilliant, but a lot of them are too out of the box or weird to have any real connection with them. You have a Don, which is like an academic advisor, but they rarely are very helpful and the weekly check ins become monotonous and unproductive. A lot of them don&apos;t seem to seriously care about the individual circumstance of the student; you can tell that when talking with you they&apos;re just doing their job.\\n12. The size is so small there is no escaping any of what was previously mentioned. The population makes it so that there is no opportunity for any type of student diversity.",

They were both exceptionally well prepared to enter Kindergarten in a competitive school district. I was particularly impressed by their ability to transition to an online format during the pandemic, as well as the numerous measures they have taken to keep the school operating safely once children were allowed back in. My children always loved their teachers and progressed academically as a direct result of the tailored curriculum. They have been taught reading, writing, math, languages, science, art, and yoga all in a loving environment. We could not have asked for more.",

The school is tiny, antiquated, dingy and smells like mold. As an example of their antiquated viewpoints, the literature used to describe their school actually says &quot;retarded children&quot;.  When I spoke to Dr. Jagoda about how this language might be construed as offensive, she replied that the literature was old, and that if I had a problem with it, I should not have signed my child up for their school. Mr. Jagoda, whom I was told I needed to contact to discuss partial refund of my nearly $4,000 paid for two weeks of school, told me that they didn&apos;t write it, but copied it from a book (not cited, btw), so it&apos;s not their fault.\\n\\nLiberty Montessori made my bright-eyed, enthusiastic little boy sad to go to school each day.  The school fed my husband and I a bunch of lines before we signed up, none of which turned out to be true. After only two weeks, I pulled my son out of their school and sent him elsewhere. I am happy to say that he has now returned to his normal, cheerful self. I am STILL waiting for Dr. and Mr. Jagoda to return my calls regarding partial refund of the $4,000 we paid their school and it is three months later.\\n\\nBuyer beware!!  Stay away at all costs.",

This is a very special school it creates a sense of community as a home away from home for our children! He is beyond happy to go to school each day and loves all his friends (he talks about school and his friends all the time). This is very loving environment by no means are children pulled or dragged around. Additionally I&apos;ve done drop off many times and children are not sitting around crying. In terms of choices for children of what they want to focus on---there are plenty Bc I can tell you my son isn&apos;t interested in his writing skills and this is not being pushed on him, he chooses to focus on other tasks!",

One morning it was snowing and we were driving by and saw Mr. Jagoda and a staff member clearing out the driveway when we stopped in there. Mr. Jagoda was one of the nicest men and set me up for an interview the next day (if there was no more snow!). We went Tuesday and we fell in love with Dr. Jagoda and staff that we started him Thursday!! He was 2 when he started but when our daughter turned 18 months we couldn&apos;t wait to start her! \\nThe school has given my children the best education that kids their age can get! The staff is the absolutely BEST staff any Montessori can have! Dr. Jagoda is one of the most accomplished and educated women I have ever come in contact with and she hand picked each teacher in the school! \\nThe atmosphere is clean in all aspects and my kids feel at home when they go each day. Both kids skip their way in to school (this speaks volumes to me!!)  to be greeted by the happiest teachers! \\nEvery day my kids are coming home singing a new song or reciting a new story! My husband and I made one of the best choices as parents sending them to Liberty! We are so excited to send our month old son their when he&apos;s 18 months! Anyone looking here for reviews for Liberty Montessori do not let Dara L&apos;s review taint your decision as its a big decision of where to send your kids and you will NOT be making any mistake by sending them to Liberty Montessori!",

Also, my son tends to be very particular with who he is comfortable with and who he will engage with. The teachers in this school were able to match their approach with my son&apos;s style. The lead teacher devoted herself to guiding my son in properly expressing his needs/wishes, managing his emotions more effectively and behaving well while collaborating with me to continue the same at home. This was all done by his teachers in a nurturing, loving and influential manner.  In a short period, I have seen remarkable growth, maturity and calmness in my son. He speaks admirably of his teachers daily and is a very happy little boy when I pick him up. I&apos;ve visited my son&apos;s classroom on several occasions and the atmosphere is positive and supportive. The teachers tactfully direct the children with kindness and affection. They are taught different languages, they are read to, they sing and dance, they have playtime, arts and crafts and they seem to always find a reason to have a party. I am grateful we found this school and the teachers there. I recommend this school without reservation.",

The teachers are fantastic and the directors super-friendly and available whenever needed. The environment is clean and stimulating for children, and they are great about sending updates via the app. \\nYou know it&apos;s a great place when the kids are running excited in the morning to go to their class. \\nWe are so happy to have found the TLE and I absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a great daycare.",

            "description": "Not ASD friendly!! \\nMy daughter was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder when she was 18 months old. I was devastated. She is 2, 1/2 years old now and thriving. She is a sweet little girl, fun loving and a pure joy to be around. The manager was very hard to get a hold of, I left several voicemails that weren&apos;t returned. I waited over three weeks for a call back! I finally got through to the manager.  I asked about availability for a 2 year old and she said they did in fact have space. I&apos;m always upfront with my daughter&apos;s diagnosis for transparency reasons, but I didn&apos;t expect to get a taste of how hard this world was going to be for my daughter at 2 years old starting with my experience with this place. The manager told me she could not accept my daughter because they do not have staffing trained to deal with an autistic child. With the CDC estimating 1 in every 44 children being diagnosed with autism you don&apos;t have one staff member trained to handle an autistic child! A major company like &quot;The Learning Experience&quot;? I didn&apos;t expect a major company like this not being ADA compliant. It&apos;s shameful! I was even willing to pay the highly exorbitant tuition fee because of how close this center was to my home.  I will be contacting the headquarters about this. I&apos;m writing this so that hopefully this place will get their stuff together and other parents of special needs children don&apos;t have to deal with the disappointment and heartbreak of doors being closed in your child&apos;s face over a condition they have no control over like how I did.",

            "description": "My both kids went to this school for approx 9 months and during these 9 months there were so many changes in their teachers, teachers leave every 2-3 months, most of the time our kids were with one teacher only (though they sent that to our face but when doing pick up and drop off we noticed that there was one teacher and our preschooler talks so he would tell us how many teachers were there in the class). Due to lack of teachers and insufficient qualifications of the teachers, the kids were not kept well in the school. Most important thing, the front desk staff lied to my face multiple times and when I pointed to them of all the issues, they again lied to my face that they will take actions and nothing changed. Some of the front desk staff is very rude and others liers. They don&apos;t take the kids out. Every time I asked them, they said they have stroller issues, or other reasons. But their main problem is they don&apos;t have teachers to manage kids in the school forget about taking them out. My kids have been going to another school now and I have seen so many changes in the way they are kept in school. I will really really not recommend this school to anyone. Stay away from them. You can&apos;t trust whatever they say on anything.",

            "description": "I&apos;m going to cut to the chase and say that The Learning Experience has given my daughter the best care and community I could ask for. If you&apos;re looking for a responsible, responsive, proactive, open, clean and educational place to send your kids, this is it. Highly recommended. Worth every penny. \\n\\nNow, a little more detail: \\n\\nI toured TLE New Rochelle before my daughter was of age to attend, and before my family had moved into the neighborhood, but our considerations, thoughts and needs were prioritized right away. Ms.Jade stayed late to accommodate my family&apos;s schedule, and showed me around the sparkling facility. Months later, that warmth is still present, and as a parent it means the world because I know that&apos;s the environment my child is in. I&apos;m pretty sure my daughter thinks her teachers are her family.  And that&apos;s cool by me!\\n\\nI love that there is a curriculum, even for the infants, but what I appreciate the most of the way TLE goes about social and emotional development. My child comes home happy, and goes to school excited to see her friends and teachers. She&apos;s always been a fairly social kid, but her environment at school has definitely encouraged her to blossom even more. \\n\\nMy family is like any other working family. Things don&apos;t always go to plan. But between updates on the school&apos;s app, or being able to send a quick text, we&apos;re able to be flexible with accommodations in a way that I honestly wasn&apos;t expecting. And that sense of flexibility is true on their end as well. Whether it was setting up safe procedures during covid, or reacting quickly to things out of their control (snow storms, etc), TLE has always been quick and SUPER CREATIVE in finding solutions and communicating the plan to parents. There hasn&apos;t been a situation where my family was left with our hands in the air- we&apos;ve always benefitted from their partnership. \\n\\nAnd I should also mention that one morning my daughter and I showed up and there was a table of bagels and coffee for the parents. That didn&apos;t hurt, either!! :)",

The teachers are kind and the entire staff is accommodating, responsive, caring and truly cares for the well being of the children.

            "description": "TLE was my son&apos;s first daycare and I think it will be his last because from what I can see now, I don&apos;t see us going anywhere else before he goes to school. \\n\\nMy son started at TLE in July of 2019. He was 1.5 years then. By September, I was looking for other daycares and I was looking to move somewhere else where I can find better options. Why is that? Well, because the management, back then, had some communication problems. And there was a lot of turnover in the teachers and there was not much stability. The higher management though were so communicating and good at addressing my concerns. They hired a new manager. Also, almost most of the teachers who didn&apos;t meet the required level of expertise were changed. \\n\\nNow, I&apos;m changing homes. One of my major requirements for the new home is to be close to TLE so my LO can go there until he goes to school. This is how much everything changed since few months ago. \\n\\nTo be honest, since the first few weeks. I could see huge improvement and change in my LO behavior and skills. Because I was so lucky to have one the great teachers from the beginning. Ms Aly, who is one of the teachers who was there since the daycare opened, is very responsible, informative and attentive. she tries her best to make the kids and  the family happy. My LO calls the daycare &quot;Aly&quot; because of how much he loves her. \\n\\nMy son now moved up to a different class, and this was scary for me at the beginning but actually the teachers there are so great too. \\n\\nI hope TLE would continue on their high standards as I can see it now. Yes, sometimes small things still happen because nothing is flawless or perfect. But now you can see immediate actions and things keep getting better.",

            "description": "Being a first time parent is never easy. It is one of the most difficult journeys we have had to face because when it came to the &quot;who will help us&quot; phase we were a little lost. At first we didn&apos;t look for a day care, but when it came time to look for one we had certain criteria. Was it the right thing? Do they teach as well as have fun? Is the setting safe? Do they provide food/nourishment? This along with many other questions dreaded my mind, but in the process of all this, we discovered The Learning Experience (TLE). When my wife and sisters-in-law showed me TLE for the first time, honestly I was a little skeptical. I couldn&apos;t believe that such a place existed especially one as established as this. As I was doing research into TLE, we decided to go for a visit and fell in love. All my criteria and my wife&apos;s criteria for a day care was met. We found a cozy nest for our son to enjoy, learn, play with other children and then some. We are in love with TLC and all I can say is that if you have the opportunity to go see and have your child attend, do it. It&apos;s a chance of a life time and the faculty has been nothing but God sent. \\n\\nAlbert Einstein said &quot;You can never solve a problem on the level in which it was created.&quot; As working parents with constant changing schedules, it was no doubt we were having intense child care issues. Traveling and having inconsistent child care providers proved difficult while we waited. Darlene and her staff have always been available since we first found out about the location of this TLE. My wife and I did have an opportunity to go to other locations while we waited, but we decided to wait it out because of how wonderful and marvelous Darlene is. Believe me, I cannot stress it enough. You cannot have good things without waiting and the wait is over. Not everyone will agree but that&apos;s why opinions and advise are warranted by different people.\\n\\nIf you wish to contact us, feel free to contact me by replying. Trust me. We waited a while, but it was worth all the wait. We were kept updated all the time we called while it was in the process of opening. Sometimes patience and a little waiting goes a long way. I hope this helps everyone that reads into this a little bit. Thank you and God bless.",

            "description": "My kid is 2.2 yrs old. He definitely had trouble in the beginning to adjust, but picked up quickly as he was taken care of. The teachers and the management staff is very good and they hear you. I could simply talk to Ms. Angela or Ms. Darlene whenever I wanted to. And they always assured me. I like how Ms. Andrea pitches in whenever there&apos;s a short of teacher or help needed in my kid&apos;s room. And my baby loves her. Kids want to see happy and smiling teachers, it is VERY IMPORTANT. And I hope they always stick to this feature. The facility is well managed. As parents, we really like and recommend TLE. My husband was keen on TLE and kept waiting for the center to open. He was so excited and happy to enroll here. My only reason for 1 star less is that my kid isn&apos;t a great self eater yet. He&apos;s moody. And initially the teachers tried a couple of times to feed him or sit with him while eating, but they stopped that soon. Having said that he dsnt eat anything except for sipping water. I wish they had put some more effort on him than just quitting if he nodded a NO. \\nOverall, a great and happy place for kids with good teachers around.",

            "description": "This school is very pretty looking, but the communication of the staff, blatant deception, and neglect of laws and care for children is outrageous. I enrolled my children ( first time in daycare, normally very happy kids). They cried the entire day everytime. I was ok with the fact that they were transitioning so it would be hard. I never got any pictures for one of my children for 1 week. The other child that was adapting well, I got pictures on the 3rd day. I called many times during the day to ask for pictures and updates. They reassured me all was fine and he was &quot; transitioning&quot;. When I picked them up after 9hrs, my son had only had some crackers 1 barely wet diaper and cried most of the day per one teacher, but another said he was fine! They told me pictures were coming, but never came. What are you hiding? The excuse tht the internet didn&apos;t work doesnt cut it. The pictures should be saved on the iPad, but there were none. They never got my paperwork or read the packet they made me complete of like 10 pages on how to manage my kids. It was given back to me to sign portions (children section unread). I made every attempt to accomadate the new situation, even told them I can leave work, but no feedback given. So what do I do and how can I help?? I leave a long message, professionally. Guess what, they ignored it. I had to call them and ask if they got it. They had the audacity to give me attitude then tell me my kids should not be enrolled because they didn&apos;t have a medical form for them that they lost! Long story short they told me I can leave NO CHARGE...smh. So let&apos;s make a list.\\n1) understaffed from 6a to9a and 3p to 6p. So many kids in a room with just one teacher on 2 occasions I picked up my child.\\n2) They are not ready to manage children that are not already daycare seasoned.\\n3) They lie. Tell you what you want to hear about your kids so they can keep numbers up and protect their bottom line.\\n4) Children are not their top priority, the business is\\n5) Teachers are not showing up and coming in extremely late per a conversation I overheard in management meeting\\nMy kid is traumatized and the next school I took him to he was scared to death for me to leave his site. Communication and honesty could have redirected and resolved this mess. No one sounded like they genuinely cared until I threatened legal action and wanted to leave.\\n\\n***update, first day of school at new daycare was great! No problems both children happy...transitioning doesnt equate to trauma after all",

            "description": "We&apos;ve had our son at TLE New Rochelle since he was about 4-months-old. He&apos;s now 1.5-years-old and runs -- literally runs -- into &quot;school&quot; every single morning with a big smile on his face. He adores his teachers (shoutout to Miss Laura, Miss Namiah, Miss Jailene, Miss Grace, Miss Victoria, and Miss Kat!) and we&apos;ve been impressed with how quickly his verbal and fine motor skills have developed in such a short period. He&apos;s also never been sick, minus the occasional runny nose -- a testament to TLE&apos;s sanitation practices, which are especially appreciated right now. Most notable to our great experience at TLE is Miss Jade, who started as the lead infant teacher and is now director of operations. She keeps the wheels running at the center and helps us feel our son is in great hands every single day (and he loves all the stickers she gives him). Also, the center&apos;s proximity to the New Rochelle train station is unbeatable... There is a parking garage just across the street and then it&apos;s a quick walk to the train. The only downside: no windows or outdoor playground, but the kids still go for regular walks and play outside pending weather. For those in the area (and especially those commuting into NYC), we highly recommend!",

I did a tour of TLE in Riverdale and I was very pleased with the concept but didn&apos;t really like the location and thought it was too expensive. When I heard of this location opening up I was very excited and hopeful. Did a tour and reviewed prices and I knew this would be the one. I was told it would take a while due to it being a new construction and liscences have to be obtained. I was willing to wait because I completely fell in love with everything about this day care. The staff is great and very friendly, the location secure and clean, the curriculum is amazing, hours are great (not many day cares open early and close late). Last but not least I love the fact that there is an application where I can see pictures of my son, everything he eats, all of his activities and diaper changes. I can finally go to work in peace and know that he is in great hands. I recommend this place to everyone! Definitely best decision ever.",

Our child never actually started daycare with this center.\\n\\nWe were very much looking forward to starting our son at this center. It is very close to our home and the company overall has a good reputation. We were told by Darlene in December that the center would open in early January but did not get an exact date because it was still under construction. We went to a tour of the facility in January where we were then told the daycare would be opening in early February. (Change #1) We officially enrolled our son after the tour. We gave a start date and had it confirmed by Darlene.\\n\\nToward the end of January we hadn&apos;t gotten any updates so we contacted Darlene who said they were expecting to open end of February. We expressed concern for the ever changing opening dates and with mom going back to work we needed to make sure our son was settled before she returned. We requested a refund and were told they needed to speak to the owner about it. After this conversation we NEVER heard back from Darlene. We left messages where people made apologies for the lack of communication and said they&apos;d forward our message for a callback. Again, we were NEVER contacted, not even to inquire why our start date had come and gone and our son had not shown up. We finally enrolled our son in another TLE location about 20 minutes from home and about $400 more expensive. Finally, after weeks of no one returning calls or emails we contacted our bank to initiate a dispute. Only after receiving notification from our bank did someone from the center call us back.\\n\\nThis is the place that is supposed to care for our children. Communication is key to proper care and safety. If they ignored us and didnt care enough to inquire about the child they were to care for, where else will they lack in communication?",

The trainings have been pretty easy and adjusting within the center has been a breeze with Darlene and Ang! No need to purchase my own supplies, the classrooms are fully stocked and Darlene is always prepared and willing to provide any materials that are needed. Very appreciative of that! I also highly appreciate being able to take the children on daily walks as its refreshing and needed. Definitely feels like a family here and I couldn&apos;t ask for anything more!",

We had a very difficult and horrible experience at another local daycare so we were very particular with the next daycare our son would attend.  Angela, the assistant director, put our minds at ease with all of our concerns and our son is now thriving. The staff is an amazing group of warmhearted, patient, knowledgeable and experienced professional care givers. What stands out to us the most is our first week at drop-off our son was naturally scared. We didn&apos;t know how the transition would go and, as any parent would feel, we were nervous. The staff gave him such a warm welcome and made him feel comfortable right away. This spoke volumes to us and solidified that we made the right choice in daycare provider.   Our 3.5 son is learning so much through their curriculum and the services that they offer are exceptional.  We get pictures and information throughout the day which is always a delight as well as reassuring to see. We love to see our son smiling, laughing and having fun all while learning.

Which she loved. My review is about the look of the campus and the graduation. The campus was very clean and green. They had it whole graduation planned out really well. There were police officers directing you where to go. And then they had a shuttle that would pick you up and drop you off at the graduation building. They only had a few schools graduating at our daughters 3:30 pm graduation.  They evidently had a later graduation and a Saturday graduation for other schools of study. It really cuts down on the length of the event and the traffic getting in and out of the college. I thought this was very smart. It was quick and efficient. The graduation was less than an hour long.",

On the comment by Sean T: &quot;...unless you have the time and money to visit Atlanta and social life/on campus events are almost nonexistant ...&quot;.  First, the work is nonexistent, not &quot;nonexistant&quot;.  Columbus is the sort of place you come to GET AWAY from the Atlanta mega-mess.  Get it ?\\n\\nThe local job market features many large and respected companies, especially in manufacturing.  I don&apos;t know where Sean T gets his information. Columbus is a nice city, with its share of blight and problems, but the urban waterfront is probably the nicest in the country for a city this size.  Local dining is not expensive that I have ever seen after 19 years.  Good specialty restaurants, especially along the historic waterfront. \\n\\nIt would be nice to know the surrounding circumstances that provoked that rant about CSU and Columbus...",

            "description": "As a MIS business major, this University provides many opportunities that make it very competitive with other Universities in Ga.  Examples are: Certification for one of the Business World&apos;s most used programs by that company,  fair tuition costs, very good support for veterans, internships with large company&apos;s like TSYS and Aflac, great student recreational facilities (the gym, pools, climbing wall are great), and a great faculty that go out of their way to help students that show effort and ask for that help.\\n\\n   Parking can be challenging at times but I am sure that is common at other Universities.  I really enjoy it here and for a business major it really is a pretty great place.\\n\\n   Just for clarification,  Shawn T in a previous review says &quot;This &quot;university&quot; has a 30% graduation rate thanks to a combination of mediocre local high schools and harsh grading from professors.&quot;  He is skewing numbers, which many people who are not educated enough to understand them often do.  So for he and other Yelp readers I will clarify. \\n  \\n   He is referring to the &quot;on-time&quot; graduation rate, which does not consider  transfer students, persons taking more than 4 years to graduate, or several other factors.  To fairly compare, consider that Auburn University&apos;s &quot;on time&quot; 4 year graduation rate is 38.2% and the national average is 34.4%.  Also consider CSU has many active military and veterans that are &quot;non-traditional&quot; students like myself that also count against that number.\\n\\n   As you can see CSU is actually very close to the average, but I guarantee you that the professor to student ratio is much better here than at Auburn.  Plus, let&apos;s get real, only the people who could not get into Alabama end up going to Auburn anyway:)",

There they get your information, orders, and assign you your roster number and STX (squads) and platoons. Then they issue you our helmets and canteens that you will be carrying around every day at Airborne School. After that, off-base and Abrams Hall personnel are released, and those that are staying in the barracks are released to the barracks for the weekend. Each Platoon rotates fri-fri pulling CQ duty (1 officer or NCO with 2 joes).\\n\\nGround Week begins that Monday, with your standard PT test at the gravel pit near the 250ft towers plus a 10second hang from the pull up bars. You only need to pass a minimum number of pushups and situps (45, 56 something like that) in proper form (all the way down, all the way up) in order to pass it. Noone&apos;s going for a 300, there&apos;s just no time for that.\\n\\nAfter the pt test you are immediately moved into training. You will run everywhere (do the airborne shuffle) so get ready for that. \\n\\nGround is consisted of the mock doors, the 35ft tower with ziplines, and PLFs (Parachute Landing Falls, or how to properly land and fall) in the gravel pits. \\n\\nThe next week is Tower week, and here you will continue to train on the 35ft tower, if weather and time permits, the 250ft towers, and then the swing trainer for your PLFs, and the suspended harnesses where you will train for malfunctions.\\n\\nFinal week, Jump Week, you will conduct 5 Jumps, usually 1-2 jumps a day from an US Airforce C130 high-performance aircraft. The standard is 2 hollywood (chute and reserve chute) jumps, 2 combat equipment jumps (medium molly ruck and weapons case with the chute and reserve chute), and 1 night jump. This is on the cadre&apos;s discretion depending on time and weather conditions. Might do 3 hollywood, 1 combat, no night, etc etc. But you will do 5 jumps total. You will be pulling 18hr days. You will be in the harnesses all day. You will wait for hours. You will be sore and tired. Get used to it.\\n\\nFriday morning you will conduct your graduation, and after the barracks are cleaned you will receive your paperwork and leave Benning. \\n\\nThe quality of training is excellent, best in the world. The cadre know their stuff inside and out. This will be the most rewarding, some of the best training in the Army you&apos;ve ever received. Get psyched for it Airborne, you&apos;ll have the time of your life. Just remember, feet and knees together, and eyes on the horizon. \\n\\nHooah Airborne!",

I have the utmost respect for the Black Hats memorizing their blocks of instruction rather than going off PowerPoint or notes, and for being able to apply the material to actual jumps and real airborne units.  Plus nothing beats jumping out of a C-130 and floating through the air.  Truly a course not to miss.\\n\\nJUMPERS, HIT IT!",

But I have to say, this was one of the best times of my life.  Thinking about the training (3-5 mile runs in combat boots rocks my socks), the camaraderie (Privates with 3 months service are treated the same as Majors with over 10 years service), and the gauntlet (when you get your Airborne wings pinned to your shirt without the anchors and a hard smack from everyone as you walk down the line) brings a tear to my eye...sniff sniff.  \\n\\nBrief overview straight from the all knowing Wikipedia\\nGround Week:\\nDuring Ground Week, students begin an intensive program of instruction to build individual airborne skills, which prepare them to make a parachute jump, and land safely. They train on the mock door, practice parachute landing falls (PLF), exit the 34 foot tower, and train on the lateral drift apparatus (LDA). To go forward to Tower Training Week, students must individually qualify on the 34 foot tower, the LDA, and pass all PT requirements.\\n\\nTower Week:\\nA team effort is added to the training with the &quot;mass exit&quot; concept. The apparati used this week are the 34-foot towers, the swing landing trainer (SLT), the mock door for mass exit training, the suspended harness, and potentially the 250-foot free tower. Tower Week completes student individual skill training and builds team effort skills. To go forward to Jump Training Week students must qualify on the SLT, master the mass exit procedures from the 34-foot tower, and pass all PT requirements.\\n\\nJump Week:\\nDuring Jump Week students make five parachute jumps into Fryar Drop Zone (DZ) located in Alabama on the Fort Benning Military Reservation. Trainees must run to the air field, conduct pre-jump training, and then get into their harnesses and await their turn to jump. Generally, two of the jumps are &quot;combat jumps&quot;, in which the jumper carries a ruck sack and a dummy weapon. The other three jumps are &quot;hollywood&quot;, in that the jumper only wears the parachute and reserve. At least one jump is at night, although, during training cycles where Jump Week falls on a three day week (due to a Federal holiday), a night jump is not mandatory to graduate.",

They&apos;re there to teach you how to jump without being babysat. If you&apos;re 11 or 19 series, you probably did more running at a faster pace then you&apos;ll do here. Keep your mouth shut and learn what you can, don&apos;t act stupid on the weekends and get into trouble, and you&apos;ll have a great time.

The class I went to was clearly over-booked and I ended up being crammed in a corner in which I could not see anything going on as far as cooking. It was nice that they had mirrors on the ceiling to watch the cooking, which is what I had to do, but that&apos;s not that much different than watching a cooking show on TV. I wasn&apos;t able to truly see what was going on and every meal tasted the same due to the addition of the same 2-3 unique ingredients in each dish served, even the dessert. The class I went to was a wine paired one, but we received less than half a glass of mediocre sparkling wine. I specifically took a taxi to the event because I figured we would be trying a bit more than that. It was not really a true wine tasting/pairing as advertised. The class wasn&apos;t cheap either at nearly $100 dollars. To top it all off, the elderly lady that owns the place was not very pleasant and she was extremely rude in her correspondence that my jaw actually dropped. I really wanted to like this place and learn some new techniques, but sadly I learned absolutely nothing from this class and the food was very average. I found myself scrambling to take notes the whole time to try and absorb all I could from the chef, but I didn&apos;t get much from it. Hopefully others had an appropriately booked class and actually learned something.",

The flavors and dessert were great, but my husband would have eaten his arm off if he had come.  My friend that booked the class said she was told there would be wine and appetizers for coming early - not.\\nWe would have been able to look past the small and SIMPLE bites if we had filled up on invaluable tips on Trader Joe&apos;s products or were introduced to some chef-secrets, but that wasn&apos;t the case.  Instead the owner spent the time that could have been used by the chef telling us about corporate history and philosophy that anyone could (and she did) pull off Google.\\nThe counter stools were painful to sit in, and the clanking of the dishes from their restaurant kitchen next door was distracting.  \\nWe had been wanting to do this for years so it was a big disappointment - we regretted not saving the $$ and buying one the many Trader Joe&apos;s cookbooks that are out and experimenting ourselves.",

They charge $500/month and make no guarantees about your living arrangements. One kid was given a garage as a room and no AC. Most are told that they have to stay in their bedrooms and are not free to use the house. Some are not allowed to cook, so they have to microwave or eat out. Some hosts take multiple students so they can make a lot of money and cram the kids in. They also limit utilities and all that. Yes, I&apos;ve heard horror stories. Ew, and one old couple only gets young Asian girls, and the old man is super friendly with them and likes to sit out with them while they are in the pool.\\n\\n2. They got super nosy and refused to give my dad a letter stating that my cousin was a full-time student at the school on letterhead. Simple, right? nope. They didn&apos;t want to give the letter, and my dad had to raise hell for t he simple letter. \\n\\n3. They give each student a handbook. I went in the day after they gave them to the students and asked for an extra copy for my parents. The lady hands me the book and starts explaining away excuse after excuse about errors and mistakes and misinformation and contradictions contained within. Did she bother to do the same for the students? Nope. Only told me because I speak English fluently. \\n\\n4. One teacher was super strict. Which is fine. But she was also MEAN. The teacher told one girl that she was stupid and shouldn&apos;t even bother to learn English.....and she did so in the middle of class in front of everyone.\\n\\n5. Another teacher isn&apos;t qualified to teach. Why? Because she was marking certain things incorrect. But they were correct. And I helped my cousin find the rules in a grammar book I bought for him since their textbooks don&apos;t cover grammar at all (kinda odd for an English academy?). He took the papers in with the rules marked in the book and asked her why she marked them wrong. The teacher just said ok and left. Eh? Did she bother telling the other students that she was teaching them to write run-on sentences instead of proper compound sentences? Nope.\\n\\nShould I go on? Nah, just know that the list continues on and on and on....",

Apple sent me to this location and they were trying to charge me $265 when Apple said it was going to be free. Icreative even said it would take 5hours-48 hours to fix but I called support while in the parking lot and they had my computer fixed in 45 mins and the female&apos;s attitude changed, no way I&apos;m paying $65 just for them to talk to me, $70 for them to do what Apple already did remote and then $70+ for them to download the MACOS that Apple said should be the only thing they needed to do. \\n\\nAs I was there 2 other older customers were complaining about the prices. They won&apos;t even talk to you unless you pay for consultations $65 minimal. A joke!!!! There were other issues while here but whatever I&apos;ll never come back! Try to contact Apple tech support via phone before coming to Icreative. You may save a lot of money!!!!!",

When trying to take my iMac to run diagnostics on it the cost would have been $200 but they ran my diagnostics and gave me the issue with a quote on how much it would take to fix. My issue was a bigger fix so I only paid $35 for the diagnostic run, but they were super thorough! Will definitely only be coming here to take care of my Macs. \\n\\nThank you!",

I spent time on the phone with Apple Support, which was terrific, but no solution. I even did a reinstall of my OS. Still no cure. Casel helped me at the counter. He quickly figured out that the Digital Output jack switch was stuck in the ON position. (I had mistakenly plugged my analog headphones into that jack recently.) He had a special tool to turn the switch off. Problem solved. When I asked, &quot;How much?&quot; He replied, &quot;No charge.&quot; iCreative is a terrific repair service for all your Apple needs. I highly recommend them. Thanks, Casel!",

I was lucky enough to find Jean Benson with a google search and the staff there got my daughter started right away. The staff is very conscientious of illnesses and always looking out for the best interest of the child. They use an app to stay in contact with parents about their children, including pictures and important messages. My daughter fell in love with all of the teachers she would even ask to see them over the weekends. She has since moved onto elementary school and to this day still asks for the staff at Jean Benson. That alone shows how much love they put into what they do. Not a day went by that any of the staff looked unhappy. \\nI met f families there who have had all of their children attend this program, which is great to hear about a school. \\n\\nWe miss Jean Benson!! You will definitely not regret sending your child to this school. \\n\\nI know that every review can&apos;t be all peachy. The only negative thing I can say about this daycare is the parking isn&apos;t the best. There are times during the busy drop-off and pick-up blocks there is no parking available. Nothing a little patience won&apos;t fix. \\n\\nI recommend them 100% to any parents looking for quality care for their little ones.",

Location is perfect as I feel is very private, it&apos;s a smaller YMCA compared to other locations but I love the atmosphere when I walk in every morning to drop off my son, Monique is super sweet at the entrance, Ms Alyssa is so adorable and nice, so is Ms Rose! I feel so comfortable every morning dropping off my son as they always hold him, or hug him in a very loving way on days where he doesn&apos;t want to stay.Such an inviting atmosphere makes me want to be a kid again just to be able to stay, seriously! Thank you girls for being so sweet all the time! I almost don&apos;t want my son to grow up because I wish teachers would remain as sweet as all of you! Your job is the hardest yet you all always manage to keep a huge smile on your face, I absolutely love this place, I highly highly recommend it to any parent out there that&apos;s looking for a child care development, I have three kids and I must say this is by far the best one, and I am so glad I found it, Or I should say I&apos;m glad LQ YMCA recommended me to this location it&apos;s just perfect!

Very rude security definitely a Barney five situation. Maybe the security should be trained on how to talk and treat people on their campus. And not act so gung ho. Mellow out security.",

The campus is well maintained, the classroom are usually clean and neat. I have had many wonderful professors that are engaged, and do their best to keep things interesting. Certainly, I have had a class or two where the professor should reevaluate their classroom demeanor.\\nWhat I see most of is that many of the students are just out of high school, and are not used to the college environment. At the college level teachers/professors are not going to hold their hand, and keep reminding students to get their reading and assignments done. Most &apos;failures&apos; are caused by unprepared or unwilling students.",

You must do your research before meeting with them. \\n\\nASSESSMENT TEST: STUDY! You must take this assessment test seriously because if you do not do well, you will be place in non-credit remedial math/English courses which will take you awhile. \\n\\nSTUDENT LIFE: There is no student life.

I have to commence by stating the admission department needs a roadmap to blow their nose; I was told that since I did not have an on-line account I would have to drive to come and get my transcripts. The lady who answers the phone failed to tell me 1) There is NO visitor parking 2) I would have to have cash to pay for an all day parking pass 3) There is a $6.50 library hold that would delay getting my transcripts 4) It will take 24 hours to release my transcripts 5) Finally, to top all this off that it will cost me $25 to get my transcripts contingent on getting the library hold released. \\n\\nThis all was per &quot;Blanca.&quot; This individual stated I would have to go to the library and resolve, come back &amp; get my transcripts. When I finally got back from the library the lady there a 2nd lady who after 30 minutes, a different &amp; equally difficult lady sent me back downstairs for the 3rd time to pay. I came back up &amp; she was unsure Ido was going to be able to get my transcripts today until I told &quot;Blanca&quot; said I would. When I enquired with the 2nd lady she was extremely persnickety &amp; said &quot;well, did you ask if there was visitor parking?&quot; I asked if there wasn&apos;t a policy &amp; procedures in place to properly inform people who called. I explained that I was clear about the fact I was coming from Orange County &amp; why would I not be properly informed. 2nd lady said well generally a student answers the phone, so I take that as her passing the buck and absolving herself of any responsibility. \\n\\nThankfully, Roger at the student library was able to clear the hold, man has the patience of a saint.\\n\\nIn summation this whole ordeal has left me with an inset on a migraine. I am going to have to go have lunch because it&apos;s going to take another hour to get the official transcripts.",

            "description": "My three youngest sons, all five year-olds, are currently attending Palm Valley School.  We moved to the desert from Orange County last summer; prior to the move, I spent a lot of time researching every school in the valley (I&apos;ll save you the effort).  My gut said Palm Valley School, so scheduled a visit.\\n\\nThe first person I met was Abby Sturgeon, Director of Admissions.  Absolutely wonderful person!  Abby stayed late after our meeting to answer questions, and gave me a tour of the Transitional Kindergarten building and classrooms.  During my meeting with Abby, Dr. Steve Sherman, Palm Valley Head of School, came in to say hi.  Another wonderful person!  I left that afternoon certain this is where I want my kids to learn.\\n\\nA few days later, I was back at Palm Valley filling out all the admissions paperwork for my three little boys.  As a single dad, my kids are with me almost all the time when not in school.  They joined me this time as well.  It was a bit overwhelming filling out paperwork with three curious and active little guys bouncing around me.  I was going to take it home, but before I had a chance to pack up, in walks Dr. Steve Sherman.  Steve, instead of assisting me out the door, voluntarily took my kids for an impromptu puppet show, raced them in the halls of the empty building, and entertained them in a way that would have made Mary Poppins jealous.  I was able to complete the remaining paperwork without distraction.\\n\\nOver this past year I have gotten to know Steve much better.  He is often out in the front entry driveway greeting vehicles in the morning, many times with costumes coinciding with holidays.  Steve is almost always outside the school buildings saying goodbye to the kids and parents in the afternoon as well.  He is a super high-character guy who truly cares about every student at his school... and apparently builds elaborate five-star treehouses for his grandkids in his spare time.\\n\\nMy sons originally started transitional kindergarten this past August.  First day... met more amazing staff and teachers!...  Becky Chaffins (Assistant Director of Preschool/ Lead Teacher) and Kaira Beach (Head of Preschool).  Class sizes of about 12 students.  Lots of love and a passion for teaching is what you can expect from Becky and Kaira.  My little guys ran into their classroom every day without looking back.  They left school each day excitedly talking over each other about what they had learned.\\n\\nBy October, my three sons were doing well enough to be moved up to kindergarten, at age four.\\n\\nCould it get any better?... apparently, yes.  Now I have the pleasure of meeting Francene Fisher (Head of Lower School), Jeanne Anguiano (Lower School Operations), and Annette Van Vliet (Kindergarten Teacher).  If there is a better group of people to leave my kids with, I&apos;m yet to meet them.  Class size again is about 12 students.\\n\\nMy three sons and their classmates bonded quickly, and I mean all their classmates.  They love each other.  My kids write beautiful notes and draw pictures for other students and Annette many evenings after we get home, so they can bring them the following day.  They run to other students at drop off to hold hands as they walk to class.\\n\\nThe parents are great too.  We meet at the zoo, meet for birthdays, and do play dates often.  I have never seen or heard of a school that has an environment like this.  I&apos;m grateful every day they are at Palm Valley, especially during these critical early years of learning.\\n\\nNow, academics.  My kids just turned five, and they are reading, writing, understand concepts of time, measurement, estimation, math, speak rudimentary Spanish, know basic sign language, sing songs they learn in music class, practice art using depth perception, count in the thousands, etc, etc, etc.  The person primarily responsible:  Annette Van Vliet.  Annette has been teaching kindergarten at Palm Valley School for nearly 20 years, and inspires a deep passion for learning in such a kind and loving way.  My kids are confident in their abilities and, most importantly, have a strong foundation for the future.  I could never thank Annette enough for everything she has done for my kids.\\n\\nUsually, I try to balance out an evaluation with pros and cons.  This is a rare instance where I cannot think of one thing I would change about Palm Valley School.  Sending my kids to Palm Valley is one of the best decisions I&apos;ve ever made.  I have an 18 year-old son as well who went through private schools in Orange County, from pre-K through high school.  All stellar schools.  Yet, did not understand how exceptional a school could be until this past year.",

My wife and I love the education, care, and attention our son  gets from the teachers and other staff. The school is very organized and structured, plenty of family events as well. Since our son started going here he has been very polite to others, his vocabulary is outstanding. We also love the buddy system , each pre-school  student gets an older student from the school that escorts them to events such as assemblies, our son thinks its the coolest thing to hang out with older students. Very secure campus, plenty of space for kids to play, classrooms are very tidy and organized, and the teachers give plenty of attention to each and every student.",

It&apos;s not easy picking a school, but after the school year has started I know I&apos;ve made the absolute right choice for our family. Not only am I honored to be a Palm Valley parent, I&apos;m extremely proud!!!!!\\n\\nThe administration is very welcoming, accommodating, and open to hear my voice and anything I&apos;ve had to say.   I feel comfortable to discuss what I feel is important, whether it be my with my child&apos;s teacher or the  wonderful head of school Mrs. Rice. I&apos;ve been treated with great respect and nothing less!!\\n\\nI believe in this  incredible school and align myself with the way its ran 100%. Mrs. Rice is the leader that Palm Valley needs and I&apos;m confident  that she makes the best decisions for our school.  Her devotion is truly pure and the love she has for Palm Valley is undeniable!\u00a0 Our school wouldn&apos;t be what it is today, without her.  A big thanks to the whole administration working together to give our children the best!! \\n\\nMy  child has blossomed more than ever since attending Palm Valley, and I know its because of the devotion and compassion this school is made of.  My child&apos;s teachers have  made an impact on my child&apos;s life as they continue to grow and learn and I am forever grateful for that!! \\n\\nPalm Valley is an exceptional school that has far exceeded my expectations.  From the kind Teachers such as; Mrs. Traub, Ms Garza &amp; Ms Perez, awesome Directors like Mr. Klausz , and Wonderful Head of School Mrs. Rice - everyone has been easy to talk to and share input with.  The community here is Real and  it feels like Family!!  Cheers to many more years!!",

Everything changed since 2015 after the era of the new principal.\\nIf you want to know more about how the head of school is running the business see this article:\\n\\nhttps://www.desertsun.com/story/news/education/2018/10/18/palm-valley-school-parent-complaints-end-student-expulsions/550826002/\\n\\nThis is what happens to kids whose parents dare to criticize or question the head of school. \\nShe rules the school with absolute power exactly like a dictator.\\nThis is not something that we should see in the 21st century and in America.\\n\\n\\nEdit: I actually have firsthand experience with the head of school. My son, Ryan, who was in Palm Valley since kindergarten got expelled from school last March with no fault of his own. \\nMy son started school in Palm Valley when he was 5, he actually grew up in this school. He had all his friends in the school and in March this year while he was in 6th grade, he was expelled by the head of school. It was a very difficult time for him to adjust. He couldn&apos;t understand why he- who has not done anything wrong should be punished. \\nI still don&apos;t know how a person calling herself principal who is supposed to care for the kids and actually shape their trust towards authority can do such a thing to a kid.\\nI posted this review because I want parents to make an informed decision before they sign up their kid for this school and under the supervision of the new administration.",

            "description": "In my 13 years as a member of the Palm Valley School community where my younger two children went, 9 of those years were under the leadership of Mr. Vince Downey and were fantastic years. During that time I can recall one student being expelled for possession of a knife and threatening another child.  The child actually did something wrong.   In the past two years, we have been under the leadership of Susan Rice- who I consider to be an egomaniacal dictator.  She has expelled many innocent young students because their parents had questions regarding grades, mass exodus  of teachers mid year or  other such concerns that she didn&apos;t want to answer or deal with.  Mind you, the parents pay a lot of money and should be able to question anything, especially with regard to education, grades, teacher turnover, meals, etc Last week, We dodged a bullet and preemptively withdrew Our son knowing he would be the next victim of her expulsion. He is a straight A student with not a negative mark on his record and lived by teachers and peers. In her usual MO, as she has done with previous parents, she sent us an email stating that we need to meet with her in her office immediately or the outcome would affect Sid. It was a veiled threat. Well, we did our research and found out from several sources what exactly transpires in her Little Chamber of Secrets.  Her email was prompted by recent concerns I had regarding her leadership and the loss of many faculty and students under her regime. Even after we withdrew Sid she sent me an epic email  which now directied the threats at me.  Today I learned that another brilliant, MENSA category, articulate, talented 6th grader  was expelled because his parents had similar concerns. The student as with many before him did NOTHING wrong.  Like  Sid he had been there since preschool and also like Sid was an asset to the school as a student.  Can you imagine the emotional trauma and impact on these kids?  But what really irks me is how other faculty, families and the Board stand silently and allow her to carry on?  Is it a dictatorship? Are there no checks and balances? Does she have sole decision making power? The family whose child was most recently expelled fled  from Iran to escape a dictatorship. Doesn&apos;t anyone care about the impact this has on the children?? Being expelled, having a mark on their record, leaving a place and community they have considered home, leaving friends, having to make new ones with three months remaining in the school year?  What does the Board do?? The Board is comprised of supposedly upstanding members of the community such as doctors, lawyers and even law enforcement officers. In my opinion, These people are no different than the people who knew about and enabled criminlas like Jerry Sandusky Or Larry Nassar.  While this is not sexual abuse or physical it is ABUSE.  Abuse of power and emotional abuse towards innocent children.. Silent bystanders who know and allow this conduct to continue are just as guilty of wrongdoing and emotionally abusing children.  It is truly a sad state of affairs which  will undoubtably lead to the decline and possible death of what was once a great school.  Do your Due Diligence. Unfortunately, I had to give it one star but that is being generous. There should be a negative star rating.\\n\\nI",

            "description": "Palm Valley has been a wonderful experience. My daughter, a happy and bright little girl in her third year at Palm Valley, loves the school.  As a single parent who is bearing the entire cost of the education, I also love PVS for a number of reasons. \\n\\nThe first reason are the teachers. They are caring, capable, and committed. Most, if not all, have advanced degrees, bring rich experiences to the classrooms, and pay attention to the details. Each of my daughter&apos;s teachers she has loved, and have been caring, empowering, and made sure each student received what he or she needed. For example, during each of the last two school years, both of my daughters teachers, without being prompted, volunteered to stay late a few afternoons a week to tutor my daughter through some tough spots. \\n\\nAnother reason I am a fan of PVS is the staff. The staff are well-educated, and caring professionals. They make the time to address issues, provide updates, and ensure each of the kids receive what that individual student needs to thrive.  In my case, staff has been especially patient with my situation, and has kept a loving eye out over my daughter. I can&apos;t tell you how much this means.  The staffs&apos; care has truly been a blessing. Each of the staff my daughter interacts with are good-hearted, ethical women, who take pride in what they do. IMHO, they are great influences.\\n\\nAnother reason I value my daughter&apos;s time at Palm Valley are the resources, which are available to her.  There are a total of nine students in my daughter&apos;s classroom.  She can&apos;t help but get one-on-one time and attention not possible if she was attending a school with 30 or 40 students per classroom. There are a number of enrichment programs such as technology, robotics, music, physical education, language, and a really strong arts program. Also, PVS values critical thinking and reasoning. They begin to introduce the rigors of college-level education as the students advance in their PVS education. I watch the graduating seniors each year. Each year, PVS&apos;s seniors are accepted into a number of the nation&apos;s top universities with significant scholarship offers. I want this for my daughter.\\n\\nAnother reason I value my daughter&apos;s time at Palm Valley are the other parents. The majority of the parents I&apos;ve met are accomplished professionals from a variety of fields who care about their child&apos;s(ren&apos;s) education. Please know I have a number of friends who are similarly impressive people and professionals. These friends care deeply about their child, and chose to send their kids to public school. That works for them, and I am confident their kids are going to do incredible in life [in part because they have such good parents (the apple doesn&apos;t fall far from the tree)].   This said, I like knowing that when my daughter makes friends at school, and spends time with these friends outside of school, there is a high likelihood that the parents of the other kids similarly value academics, achievement, and hopefully integrity. \\n\\nLastly, my daughter has made a number of great friends. The kids in her class are bright, good hearted, and come from an ethnically diverse background.  Great kids, great parents, and enriching experiences... All good things.    \\n\\nWhile the cost of PVS is no small amount, I look at the yearly tuition as an investment in my daughter&apos;s future.\\n\\nI hope my thoughts help anyone looking for the &quot;perfect&quot; school to send their child/ren. While no school is perfect, PVS has been a great, great experience.",

My family has felt extremely welcomed into this wonderful community. Starting with the Head of School Mrs. Rice and continuing down to Mrs. Fisher the Head of Lower school, where my daughter is in kindergarten and Mr. Klausz the Head of Preschool where my son is. My children previously attended another private preschool in the area but after attending a few events for PVS, we felt this was a better fit moving forward. We love the teachers that our children have and feel like we are leaving them with family. The communication is open and honest and we have never felt more confident in our children&apos;s education.",

            "description": "I have two children attending Palm Valley now. I have read all the reviews and many are from parents that have left. I thought it was time for someone to post a review from a current parent that is still with the school. While I can&apos;t speak to issues parents have had, my experience has been vastly different and positive. \\n\\nBoth of our children are happy at Palm Valley. The parents we meet through Palm Valley, we&apos;ve formed tremendous bonds with and respect. To me this speaks volumes about the school community and likely quality of kids my children will interact with. In many cases, these parents have the means to send their children anywhere they want for school and have chosen to send and keep their kids at Palm Valley. \\n\\nI have found the current administration is willing to help when asked. I have one child that was having a hard time educationally. I meet with the Head of school, within a few days of my request. She brought in teachers, the head of lower school, found us an outside testing center, and because we were willing to do what was necessary as parents, the school created a team to help. We were also expected to do our part. Our child is now receiving 1 on 1 teaching with a specialized teacher during the school day combined with classes from two grades and has built a team of staff we communicate with weekly. There are also outside tutors the school is interacting with. In fact, I meet with the whole team again this week, my 3rd time in less than a month. The school was even willing to have the outside testing company observe the classroom and paid for it.  In my opinion, way above and beyond. To get this type of specialized attention is rare but also what you&apos;re paying for at Palm Valley. \\n\\nSchool education is more than just the educational tools; reading, writing, math etc. My older child is learning how to do public speaking, learning how to act and behave, look people in the eye when speaking, Palm Valley goes beyond the traditional curriculum. My son just came back from a 2-day overnight at a Marine Institute in Catalina. To me, a school is the sum of the educational work and other activities combined that lead to a well-rounded child&apos;s total education. \\n\\nWe have found the school to be overly concerned about behavior and bullying issues and we are grateful for this. The school does expect parents to get involved if there are issues and be proactive. I like this approach and appreciate I know what&apos;s going on. I would much rather, too concerned, than not enough. The stories are everywhere today and they all end with if only someone paid more attention...\\n\\nWhere graduates are going is also a good indication of how a school is doing and Palm Valley has fantastic college placement. At the end There are cheaper options than Palm Valley it&apos;s expensive, but you get what you pay for. They also give out a fair amount of financial aid. If you compared Palm Valley to private schools in most other places, Boston, NY, Los Angeles.... it&apos;s a bargain at 30-40% less. I hope this helps prospective parents. All the best in your search.",

            "description": "My family with three children have been with Palm Valley School for 8 years.  I choose a private school because the options for public school are just not appealing to me for them.  That leaves private school as the option and I am happy to have chosen Palm Valley School to educate and affect their lives.  They have each received a very personal, hands-on academically-driven education with many options in the fine arts.  The school is made up of three dynamic campuses:  Lower School, Middle School and Upper School and I&apos;ve seen my children experience each level.  The lower school has changed significantly since my children left that part of the campus and seems all for the better with the addition of technology and labs.  Mean girls seem to be on every school campus no matter where you go and that problem although exists, is being handled much swifter than in the past.   A bully (very mean girl) and her bully mother were rightfully asked to leave after the mother bullied children (including my own). This woman actually laid hands on someone else&apos;s child.  The school did the right thing and as a private school they can act without limits of public school rules. Because the classes are smaller, the problem of mean girls is a much bigger problem at other schools and at PVS can be addressed faster with control.  The teachers and administration today identify these issues immediately and try to help everyone resolve them such as recommending relevant resources or ultimate removal if there is no willingness to change.  Because of the smaller classes, teachers will and have reached out to me about a behavioral change in my child or a concern about an academic subject.  We can and did address that immediately together and this is an invaluable service.  \\n\\nThe Middle School years are the most formative years for all children and this is my favorite part of PVS - the children grow in a very safe and caring environment where academics remain the focus.  I think this is the best kept secret in the desert - the Middles School at Palm Valley.  If you can afford private school for a short time, this is where you want to spend the money - the Middle School at Palm Valley.  The school continually emphasizes the fine arts augmenting the high academics - their experience in drama and music blow parents away with each performance and presentation.  For instance, at a young age in 3rd grade, the students begin annual poetry recitals and get excited finding the right poem to present to a large room that includes the entire school.  This is tremendous experience.  These poetry recitals carry through Middle School and the Upper School with optional participation in regional competitions.  The relationships the students develop with the teachers feel very collegiate - these are mentors the kids admire and stay connected with throughout their lifetime.  \\n\\nAlthough the school is not well known for its athletic teams, physical education is absolutely part of the daily curriculum and complemented with the teachings of a healthy life style.  For instance, Mondays are knows as Mile Monday because they have to run/walk at least a mile in PE each Monday.  Goes over well with teenage girls!  Seriously though, to keep children moving daily coupled with good eating habits, well we all know how imperative that is.  \\n\\nMy children have each received so far a very fulsome experience and I&apos;m grateful for the teachers and administration and the parents too.  The number of volunteers and commitment of the parents is significant and I know they help watch over all the kids including my own when I&apos;m not there.  I have PVS friends who&apos;ve left the area or moved to other local schools and their children are all thriving.  Evidence that the school provides a great foundation of academics and more.  \\n\\nI work full time and all the disposable income I earn goes to their education.  Each morning when I drop them off, I feel so much relief that they are in a safe place getting an exceptional education without sacrificing the arts, the sciences or physical activity.  A commitment to a private school is a very major decision and I hope this review helps another mom or dad.  My children are surrounded by teachers and parents who are committed to a well-rounded education.  Palm Valley School has been a blessing for my children and a constant foundation in a life surrounded by change.  They will each be ready for college or whatever they decide to do with lifelong friendships made along the way.",

PVS has sustained their mission in academics alongside innovative teaching.  This school has kept the attention on instilling values and keeping individual attention to students, respect, partnership and diversity. In the last 5 years I have witnessed my children&apos;s personal and academic growth.  Both have outstanding communication and conceptual skills, both have not only exceeded my expectations, but they have exceeded their own.  As I read the negative attacks written by former parents I stand to question what personal values are being shown here.   Good leaders funnel emotions into positive actions that drive change. I encourage my kids to use their personal experience and all that they have learned at PVS  to solidify their own values and ideas. I hope they commit themselves that standing to make a difference in the world has more value than becoming narrowly focused with the indifference.  PVS has a great administration. One that I have total confidence in to ensure my 2 children receive an outstanding education.",

Her teacher, Mrs. Traub, is one of a kind and clearly loves the kids in her classroom.

Mrs. Rice, the Head of School, has been friendly and engaging and even encourages parents to come in and meet with her.  We recently toured the Lower School (K - 5th Grade) just to get a glimpse into the future and we were so impressed with that specific campus...the teachers, the students, the classrooms, etc.  I can&apos;t wait for my daughter to get to experience it all!",

We will stay at the school through high school graduation for those reasons, as well as the school&apos;s emphasis on developing students to be respectful and caring citizens who value equity, diversity, and inclusion.  I feel very fortunate to have the opportunity to send my child here, as do the hundreds of families who also consider it the best school for their children.",

I&apos;ve never witnessed such unprofessional behavior especially in a children&apos;s environment. \\nI came in with my daughter (8yrs old) to ask about the class schedule, times &amp; prices. I wanted to enroll my daughter in a hip hop class. \\nWhen I walked in an older women, (the owners mother) was the only person in the studio at the time and gave me the class schedule and informed me that the hip hop class was actually going to begin in about an hour. So I asked if I brought my daughter back at the scheduled time would she be able to do the class for free considering it&apos;s her first time. She said yes. \\nWe came back for the class. We walked in and there were a few younger girls there but no one was in the front greeting people. So we stood there and waited for someone to greet us. The owner walked in with a horrible attitude, bad vibe and not a very nice look on her face. She walked right past us, went behind the counter, set her purse down with out even acknowledging our presence and walked to the back. You could definitely tell we were new to the studio and she did not show any care in the world about who we were, or why we were there.\\nThe owners mother was in the back baby sitting the owners 2/3 yr old daughter. \\nThen she returned to the front and said very rudely, &quot;can I help you&quot;. There was no hi how are you, thank you for coming in. No enthusiasm about having a new child wanting to enroll. I mean isn&apos;t that how she makes her money? \\nI then told her we were there for the hip hop class and she replied &quot;ok the drop in fee is $15.00&quot;. I then let her know I was in about an hour earlier and was told today&apos;s trial would be free. She didn&apos;t respond to me. She yelled to her mom in the back &quot;mom come out here, you told her there was a drop in few right?!&quot; Her mom then said &quot;no I let her know she can do the class for free&quot;. \\nWith anger the owner pointed to a sign in sheet and told me to sign my daughters name and then aggressively walked off. \\nThe owners 2/3yr old daughter does the hip hop class, although she isn&apos;t old enough but because the owners mom teaches the class she joins in. So when her daughter came out for the class the owner tells her mom she doesn&apos;t want her daughter to do the class because she was &quot;throwing up all day&quot;. I emmidately let my daughter know to keep her distance because I didn&apos;t want her getting sick. The owners mom insisted that she was fine and brought her in to the class anyway. \\nAt this point they were talking very rude and argumentative towards each other about the situation all right infront of my daughter and I. Great first impression right? Anyway. They both stormed off and I had no idea where to go. There are two dance rooms and I had no idea at that point who was teaching the class or where to go. So we remained at the front. \\nThen the owner returned after storming off and said &quot;the class is down there&quot; and pointed down the hall. \\nSo we walk down the hallway and the owners mother had already started the class. She was so wrapped up in the argument she was having with her daughter (the owner) she stormed off with out even guiding us to the class.\\nMy daughter walked in and the teacher did not make her feel welcomed at all! My daughter is shy and stayed in the back of the class. The teacher was not welcoming or even attempting to incorporate my daughter in the class. \\nI was shocked, furious and taken back by what I just experienced. I ended up just pulling my daughter out and that was that! \\nThere was more but this review is so long already I think you can get an idea of what the studio is like...",

However the studio lacks organization and communication there is no front desk staff and the customer service it&apos;s really bad! Bipolar bad, their ego it&apos;s bigger than their business sense,  I had to purchase a costume on my own so my daughter could match the rest of the dancers for the winter performance show, since we were given a look a like hand made table cloth fabric costume. My daughter&apos;s ballet instructor /costume designer, was extremely offended and could not understand why I wanted my daughter to look like the rest of the cast and not be the only one wearing an odd looking dress for the performance. Not only was my daughter a regular student but we had paid the costume fees  just like everyone else did. Upon learning this she decided that she would confront me in front of all the parents and students in the studio in a very rude, unprofessional manner. To top things off, the owner forgot to include my daughter in the show&apos;s program, claiming she had no recollection of the cash I had given her for this ahead of time. She didn&apos;t even apologize nor showed any type of remorse about this.  This is completely unacceptable and unethical.",

When I entered the dance room, I asked the instructor if I could sit inside the room and he said no because that distracts the kids, so I went into the hallway, when I see the instructor pull the hair of one of his older students. He pulled it hard enough that the students body came back towards him. I couldnt believe what I had just witnessed. I was extrememly upset, but did not want to cause a scene in front of my daughter. I wrote the dance studio an email explaining the situation and letting them know I would no longer take my daugher there. They responded that they would talk to the instructor, but I got no apology from them and by the way they suggested I take my daughter to another dance school because the instructor said she was great in class. The email was not apologetic and I dont think they care for what happend that day. I definitly dont recommend this place.",

I signed up online and got everything communicated to me nicely via messenger. \\n\\nAt Southern Grace Creations they offer art classes dealing with glass and resin, door hangers, canvases, and more. Classes for adults and children, beginner to advanced, and they supply everything you will need to make your art piece: (canvas, window or picture frame, paint, glass, shells, sand, glitter, resin, etc.) Some people choose to bring trinkets like a special sea shell, sand dollars, starfish, small beach wood, necklace, broach, etc. (you can also bring  other materials, including canvas and art supplies if you desire)\\n\\nI showed up and was welcomed by Bobbie, the instructor, and since this was my very first time working with resin she was very patient, explained everything about the process, and guided me along nicely. You can choose from either doing your project on canvas or on a framed glass, I chose canvas. (other options available) You pick the size of canvas or size and style of frame and you&apos;re ready to go. There&apos;s a big variety of crushed glass, shells, and all sorts of materials to put on your project and you can paint it first or work with a blank slate. (stencils are also available if you need them) \\n\\nI chose to draw and paint a basic sky, water, and beach background then cover it in different colors of glass with some shells. After your project is complete Bonnie instructs you how to properly cover it in resin, it&apos;s pretty cool. Since it takes 3+ days to cure or set you will need to come back to pick it up, and that&apos;s it. Aprons and plenty of space is provided.\\n\\nBottom line: It&apos;s especially easy with Bobbie&apos;s patient direction and you can make something that&apos;s just fun or make a family heirloom.

            "description": "Sunday, March 9th, Tony and I was driving back to Nashville from Birmingham and I chose a road route via Talladega so I could check out their historical buildings.\\n\\n I didn&apos;t know that there was this historical college here so I was very pleased and in awe of some of the gorgeous buildings that made up the campus of this old college.\\n \\nEven though there is Security Alert sign about 24 hr protection...No ONE stopped us. I enjoyed this college because of all the old buildings. When in the area, you should stop by and check it out.\\n\\nHistory:\\nTalladega College, located in Talladega, Alabama, is a private, liberal arts college. It holds the distinction as Alabama&apos;s oldest private historically black college. As of 2009 the school received full SACS accreditation\\nThe history of Talladega College began on November 20, 1865, when two former slaves William Savery and Thomas Tarrant, both of Talladega, met in convention with a group of new freedmen in Mobile, Alabama. From this meeting came the commitment, &quot;...We regard the education of our children and youth as vital to the preservation of our liberties, and true religion as the foundation of all real virtue, and shall use our utmost endeavors to promote these blessings in our common country.&quot;\\nWith this as their pledge, Savery and Tarrant, aided by General Wager Swayne of the Freedmen&apos;s Bureau, began in earnest to provide a school for the children of former slaves of the community. Their leadership resulted in the construction of a one-room school house using lumber salvaged from an abandoned carpenter&apos;s shop. The school overflowed with pupils from its opening and soon it was necessary to move into larger quarters.\\nMeanwhile, the nearby Baptist Academy was about to be sold under mortgage default. This building had been built in 1852-53 with the help of slaves - including Savery and Tarrant. A speedy plea was sent to General Swayne for its purchase. General Swayne in turn persuaded the American Missionary Association to buy the building and some 20 acres (81,000 m2) of land for $23,000.\\nThe grateful parents renamed the building Swayne School and it opened in November 1867 with about 140 pupils. A building constructed before the war with slave labor for white students became the home of the state&apos;s first college dedicated to serving the educational needs of blacks. In 1869, Swayne School was issued a charter as Talladega College by the Judge of Probate of Talladega County.\\nThe former Baptists Academy building, now known as Swayne Hall, has remained in service as the symbol and spirit of the beginning of the college.\\n\\nAndrews Hall, built in 1910, houses the Music Department and the Education Department. It is named for George Whitfield Andrews, D.D., Dean of Theological Department from 1875 to 1908.\\nArthur D. Shores Hall, constructed in 1974, is named for the late Attorney Arthur D. Shores, Class of 1927, who served for many years as a member and chairman of the College Board of Trustees.\\nDe Forest Chapel, built in 1903 in commemoration of the life and service of the Rev. Henry Swift De Forest, D.D., President of the College from 1879 to 1896. DeForest Chapel was renovated in 1996 and rededicated November 1996. De Forest was the father of inventor Lee De Forest.\\nFanning Refectory, built in 1928 from a legacy of Dr. David H. Fanning of Worcester, Massachusetts. The building contains the student and faculty dining rooms.\\nJuliette Derricotte House, built in 1940-41, was the gift of the Harkness Foundation and named for Juliette Derricotte, Class of 1918, who at the time of her death in 1932 was a member of the Board of Trustees. Formerly a staff residence and guest house, it was converted into a women&apos;s honors dormitory in 1988.\\nSilsby Science Hall, constructed in 1926, was named for Dr. E. C. Silsby,[2] who was a member of the College faculty for 37 years. The building was a gift of the General Education Board and friends and alumni of the College. It contains the laboratories and classrooms for the Natural Sciences and Mathematics.",

They are reviewing an unaffiliated school with the same name located there. \\nBayshore Christian School in Fairhope provides a complete Classical Christian education for students living in Mobile and Baldwin Counties in Alabama. Their students excel far above standards in public schools. Students are educated by well trained and qualified caring teachers who first and foremost love God. The whole person is addressed and the curriculum is complete and supported. Graduates excel and are awarded more money in scholarships than students in public schools with 10 times the graduates!  Students learn Latin beginning in 4th grade and Science and Math skills are taught well above public school standards. This school provides a wonderful environment for all children.  There is no &quot;dumbing down&quot; as all have the potential to do well.  \\nAs Federal standards have reduced public education to a worthless diploma, Bayshore Christian School in Fairhope Alabama is helping parents to produce  well educated and responsible Christ followers!",

We were able to take pictures in the weight room, and me and the boys got a chance to enjoy the beautiful campus they have. It wasn&apos;t that far from Birmingham, and the staff really seem to care about their students not &quot;Just&quot; as football players, but as individuals and their success in the classrooms. Overall, this seems to be a really good college, and even though, once again, its not an HBCU, I will fully support this school.",

            "description": "This Museum is located across from the Troy campus. It is co-located with a library that is only accesible to Troy students. They have metered street parking right out front and within a reasonable walking distance.\\n\\nThe site of the museum is significant because it is where Rosa Parks was arrested on a bus for not giving up her seat. It has a historical marker out front marking the location. It has a neat sculpture outside that can only be viewed directly, any other angles and you are looking at some posts in the group.  There is also a very nice sculpture of Ms. Parks sitting alone in her seat on the bus. It makes for great photos.\\n\\nThe museum is small and offers self guided tours. There are no pictures allowed in the main exhibit area. The tour begins in a small room with benches around it. You watch a movie about segregation in Montgomery, the bus system and the boycott. Once the movie is over, some doors open and leads you to the next area. The next area is a pretty neat reenactment of Rosa Parks being arrested on the bus. You view the action as if you are viewing it from outside of the bus. It is very nice and really makes you feel like you are in the action. \\n\\n After the reenactment on the bus, some doors open up to a gallery that has exhibits, videos, artifacts, and pictures. You move at your own pace from this spot until the end of the tour. You will see a replica carpool vehicle over there, you will also hear stories told by people that were there during that time via videos and you will see a display of leaders riding the bus after the boycott ended. They give you the option of using your phone for an audio tour in a few sections of the museum. It provides you some information about what you are looking at. I did not use it because it seemed like more effort than what it was worth to me. Some type of push button audio kiosk would be perfect in its place. Anyway, as i mentioned, the exhibit area is not a very big area. We went through it in about 15 minutes.. The entire tour took us about 30 minutes. Even though thee is not a lot to it, it was still a nice visit and I  learned a bit. It does a good job making you feel as if you are back during that time.\\n\\nNo museum would be complete without a gift shop, this one is no exception. They have a small gift shop where you not only purchase you museum admission, but you can buy souvenirs like shirts or bags.\\n\\nAll-in-all this a decent museum. I love that it is located on the historical site where the bus incident occurred. It is small, but still makes a great impact. It&apos; is definitely worth a visit if you are in downtown Montgomery. I would recommend checking out some of the other nearby museums, like the Legacy Museum and Civil Rights Center to maximize your trip.",

This was really just an intro to welcome to the museum. \\n\\nWe spent probably 1.5 hours here without doing the second portion. The last half of the museum has lots of reading, but the first part was a great simulation experience that even the youngest would get a deeper understanding of Rosa. The museum store could be improved as there are so many amazing kid books about Rosa Parks.\\n\\nThe library next door was mentioned as something to do - but they said this was only for school groups. Don&apos;t forget to walk several blocks to see the Rosa Parks statue at the fountain.\\n\\nThis is well worth the entrance fee!",

On the second floor is a photo timeline of Civil Rights events and informational columns highlighting the important faces of the movement and their story.\\n\\nBack in the main building is a gift shop, exhibition art hall and a self guided tour highlighting the famous story of Rosa Louise McCauley Parks and her defiance to give up her seat on that faithful day. What I never knew about the history of this event was that it wasn&apos;t altogether random. Rosa Parks planned to do this with the help of other civil rights leaders so they could use it as a launching point for a federal case against the unconstitutional segregation laws in Alabama. It was only an idea, but Rosa fulfilled it when she found the opportunity, because it couldn&apos;t be staged. That takes nothing away from Rosa Parks. The danger of such defiance was deadly real, as witnessed by the Freedom Riders in the same era.\\n\\nOddly, the case was not brought to court using Rosa. Instead they used the first person to actually defy the bus laws, young Claudette Colvin, whom was 15 and pregnant at the age of her arrest. Her arrest happened on March 2nd, 1955, a full 9 months before Rosa&apos;s arrest on December 1, 1955.\\n\\nThe story is told using a full sized model of a Montgomery bus as you stand outside of the bus looking through the windows (which utilize TV screens). The bus is set in a room that looks like a small movie set with buildings, a faux street and streetlights. Here is a link to a Youtube video of this exhibit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h82ajl69iy0\\n\\nOVERALL it is a great experience, especially when coupled with the other Civil Rights museums in the downtown area. Not far away from the RP Library the City of Montgomery is working to construct a park and monument @ the site of the famous bus stop where Rosa boarded. Not sure when it will be ready as digging was underway during our May 2019 visit. The Library is actually the location of the arrest. Both the Time Machine exhibit in the Children&apos;s Annex and the Bus Arrest exhibit in the main building are must see&apos;s when visiting Montgomery Alabama and the Freedom Trail. Come see the quiet unspoken life&apos;s work of a Civil Rights pioneer.\\n\\n\\n2019/82",

And since the Rosa Parks hologram wasn&apos;t working I cannot comment on the most critical piece of the museum: The actual part about Rosa and the boycott. Oh well. \\n\\nOn the other side, the room opened up but they had to turn the lights on in order to see the graphics and pictures. I basically just walked through and read the placards. Towards the back, when you walk through the larger exhibit pieces and follow the boycott timeline that&apos;s where it gets cool. They did a good job with the last section of your visit. \\n\\nCustomer service was great at the front desk.

There&apos;s a short video about segregation in busing in Montgomery and then a short video which depicts the way the arrest occurred. And then there are a couple of small rooms containing artifacts relating to her arrest and the subsequent successful Montgomery Bus Boycott, including the original fingerprint arrest record of Mrs. Park as well as other court documents and police records. (There is also a small gallery which, when I visited in April 2018, had some very powerful art by V. L. Cox.) The museum is a little on the small side, but well worth a visit if you want to learn more about Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott in the place where that history occurred!",

I found this part very overwhelming even as an adult. \\nBack at the museum we watched another short film and then went into a room to watch a video reenactment of the night Rosa Parks was arrested. \\nThe museum has other paintings, photos, memorabilia, and artifacts that take you through the civil rights movement. \\nI would say this is a &quot;must do&quot; while in town.",

I didn&apos;t have a lot of time but they have a gallery, in case you don&apos;t have time for the museum. There are two parts to the museum so you should leave about two hours. When I return I will probably take the time to really take it in. I didn&apos;t count on there being so much to see in Montgomery.",

This is probably why the first time we tried going, we thought it was closed but it said it was open. But it&apos;s because we were at the children&apos;s wing entrance. So be mindful of that. Just walk up the sidewalk and the Museum and Library entrance are right there. \\n\\nDecided to take my 7yr old, because it was the day of the midterm elections and she&apos;s doing a report on Rosa Parks for school. \\n\\nShe said it Mae her feel a little creeped out. I asked her &quot;why?&quot;, because we had also gone to the EJI&apos;s Lynching Memorial and she didn&apos;t find that disturbing at all. Apparently for her the photos and videos at the Museum make it more real for her. But she did retain a lot of the information about Rosa and the boycott. \\n\\nI&apos;m going to ask if her school will take the kids to the children&apos;s wing next year. \\n\\nThe staff is friendly and very helpful. Enjoyed ourselves",

Hurry up&quot; is the text that I got from my friend while making a slight detour and hitting the restroom instead of walking into the &quot;time machine&quot; immediately after paying $28 for two adults do to both the Children&apos;s Time Machine piece as well as the museum.  \\n\\nWhen I walked through the doors, I saw what he was talking about. Inside a big room sat an over-sized replica of a bus surrounded by used computer parts and lights that were intended to make the place look like you were traveling back in time. I don&apos;t know if I would have called it creepy - but with him being the only person in the room, I can see why he wanted me to hurry up and get there so they could start. That&apos;s right.. it was just the two of us along for the trip through time.\\n\\nThe feature started and Mr. Rivetts, our &quot;bus driver&quot; (which looked like the robot from the movie Short Circuit) took us on a trip through time starting in Cincinnati meeting a young boy named Jim Crow and ended up in the 1950&apos;s after being introduced to Mrs Parks. While definitely geared towards children, it was worthwhile to go through. There were TV&apos;s throughout the entire room and the walls became projection screens, so even if the room was packed with students on a field trip, everyone would be able to see.\\n\\nAfter going through the Children&apos;s part, our admission also got us into the 1955 and beyond part of the exhibit. A much smaller room was waiting on us with very few seats, but we sat down and watched interviews on three projectors and learned more about Rosa Parks specifically. After about 15 minutes of watching this, the automatic doors opened and we were outside on a street corner in 1955 watching and listening on the city bus when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat. \\n\\nThe rest of the tour was a self-guided walking tour of the bus boycott, church meetings, police reports and historic memorabilia. As I walked through the museum, I thought to myself many times &quot;I can&apos;t believe this happened only 50 years ago!&quot; \\n\\nLearning about this in the history books is one thing.. walking the streets of Montgomery and seeing it unfold on a likelike tour is something completely different. I&apos;ll always remember this trip and be thankful that I was able to do it.",

            "description": "Troy University oversees the Rosa Parks Library and Museum.  After a trip to the Civil Rights Museum, we stopped by here.  Without a doubt, the Rosa Parks tour features the most interactive and engaging setup that I have ever seen.  After passing the ticket gate, visitors are invited to watch an opening video on a three-panel television display mounted high above.  Given that we were a large group, seating was insufficient, but we didn&apos;t seem to take issue with plopping down on the floor.  In retrospect, it gave the video a drive-in sort of feel.\\n\\nThe next stop was an audiovisual tour of the Montgomery bus boycott.  A facsimile of the bus appeared against a wall.  Audio recordings simulated Ms. Park&apos;s refusal to vacate her seat; though Rosa&apos;s voice actor&apos;s speech was a bit slow, I appreciated the accompanying voices&apos; authenticity until the moment of her arrest.  This part of the museum was very dark, so I would urge visitors to be careful navigating this space.  The doors opened to reveal a walking exhibit of the planning and aftermath of the bus boycott.  The guide continued to walk among the exhibits and ushered us through them.  When we got to the end of the walk, double doors featured an audio recording of a MLK sermon; at its end, visitors were invited to walk through them, simulating a church revival service.  The tour ended shortly thereafter.\\n\\nI think the only thing I have to recommend is being told what else is in this building.  I suppose it worked out well since we had additional stops planned.  Nevertheless, I urge visitors to view other exhibits in the museum.  Of interest is a room showcasing the tattered clothing of enslaved Africans, their names tagged on the sleeves.",

            "description": "My wife and I have been so pleased and felt blessed to be part of the Saint James family. \\n\\nOur Journey began in January 2021 when we made the decision to move to another public school. We traveled to  Birmingham and Auburn researching schools and neighborhoods. After a number of area visits, meetings with real estate agents and tours of homes, nothing seemed to fit.  So at one point  we looked upward and ask God, &quot;this isn&apos;t working out, do you have other plans&quot;?\\n\\nHe then began to unveil His plan. That was to look at private schools in the Montgomery area. The cost would be significant, however, after running the numbers, we realized the cost of moving coupled with the premium for housing, we would actually save money over five years. \\n\\nWe began to reach out to private schools and narrowed our search to two. One a Christian school and the other, Saint James, a secular school. We then began communications with the admission office. \\nThey were amazing. Their processing of new applicants was as well orchestrated and professional as one could have imagined. \\nNext came the course selection process. Once again, this team was very engaged in guiding us along as we chose the academic course levels and electives. \\n\u00a0\\nDuring the open house event, we heard from the head of school, Dr. McLemore, and the middle school principal Dr. Taylor. They deftly handled the power outage that evening and carried on without the use of lights or PowerPoint. They didn&apos;t miss a beat. The handout materials they provided during that meeting were well thought out and very useful. \\n\\nFinally, after meeting with each of the teachers, we gained so much confidence that God had led us to the right school. We had scoured Birmingham and Auburn in our quest to find the right culture and environment best suited to prepare our son for college and life. As it turned out, that school was Saint James. \\n\\nEveryone we have met has been so helpful, communicative, responsive, and professional. Even the parking lot attendant is a great guy! \\nThe consistency, professionalism, courtesy, communications and passion to the education, emotional and psychological well being of our children has been such a constant theme throughout our Saint James experience. \\n\\nWhile we initially had some reservations over choosing a secular college preparatory school over a Christian school, as it turned out, Saint James is staffed with teachers and administrators who lives are marked by Christ. While Saint James doesn&apos;t have required Bible study or verses displayed on their marketing materials or on the school walls, it&apos;s clear the presence of the Holy Spirit is in this place.",

            "description": "A bad place for beginners. The owner is extremely nice and affable, but his inability to actually instruct (particularly for the price of these classes!) is absurd. I initially signed up for a hand-building class and noted that the instructor seemed to enjoy socializing with studio &quot;regulars&quot; more than spending a lot of time truly instructing. Indeed, one day the entire class (instructor included) spent the ENTIRE class talking and no lesson was provided at all. This was of course bothersome, but something that I could work through since hand-building can be fairly intuitive/self-taught. Also, I was motivated to learn and this is practically the only studio in the area that offers these courses. \\n\\nHowever, I then signed up for a pottery wheel course, at which point the cracks began to truly show in terms of the instructor&apos;s limitations in the teaching arena. Certainly, the pottery wheel definitely requires a LOT of practice in order to become proficient. But if the majority of your class can&apos;t even CENTER a pot--the foundation of pottery wheel work-- by the 4th or 5th lesson (and are being taught by a few of the other class members who have somehow caught on), that truly indicates there&apos;s a problem. \\n\\nI attended several open studio sessions in an attempt to hone my skills prior to additional lessons, but again, the instructor would spend the entire time socializing with others working in the studio. You felt as though you were dragging him away from his chit-chat with studio regulars in order to get instruction that you were paying him for. Two studio regulars sitting beside me at my first open studio session finally took pity on me and taught me how to center, which is certainly not their job. But there you are. \\n\\nI stuck out the wheel course for perhaps 5 sessions, in the meanwhile the majority of other students in my section stopped attending. I finally joined them, as I could certainly think of better things to do on my day off than try to wrangle a pottery wheel with little-to-no instruction.\\n\\nI imagine Dew Claw is a fantastic place for those with a background in pottery who are looking to build on their skill-set. But whether they realize it or not, this studio is truly taking advantage of new students who pay a reasonable amount of money and spend a large amount of their time for little return.",

            "description": "Last night should have been my last pottery class of the seven week Beginner Wheel session that I signed up for, however I quit after three classes and here is why:  When I arrived to the first class I was greeted by Kris who informed me that I needed to purchase clay and tools = $65. Somehow I missed that memo when signing up.  John, the instructor,  came out after eating his grilled cheese sandwich, to begin class. We met the dog Cheesy and then class began. The first class was fun - as we learned the basics and it was exciting to &quot;throw&quot; clay and feel it on the wheel. The second class started 25 minutes late because John was throwing the ball to Cheesy. I felt very frustrated when I left that night because there were lots of details about prior students that really didn&apos;t add much to my pottery lesson.  My third and final class thankfully started on time (3pm) however he demonstrated how to make a bowl and how to trim until 4:40 which  leaves 20 minutes for me to try and do the same. No way is that happening, as I am a total pottery virgin! At one point John fell asleep at his wheel in mid sentence.  I guess this is common. And then, after his demo that lasted almost the entire time (could be all the random stories) he went into the garage to find a tool and did not return. I was STRUGGLING big time. Another student with more experience stopped what he was doing and tried to help me. I felt like this should have been John helping me because that who is getting paid to teach this class. I was so frustrated that I cleaned up my wheel station and left. John was still in the garage. I told him I felt frustrated and was leaving - he did not seem concerned at all and simply said &quot;bye&quot;.  I realized that this may not be a good fit for me. I called the studio in hopes to talk to John and explain how I was feeling. I left a voice mail and did not get a return call. I emailed also. Kris responded and said John was out of town and would get back to me by Tuesday ( the day before our next class). I never heard from him. I decided that this class is not a good fit for me. I asked for a partial refund. It was denied. I saved up for this class all summer so I am pretty disappointed I ended up throwing my money way instead of learning how to throw pots. I did ask that they donate my clay and tools to the nice guy and his family that were in class with me so hopefully they were able to use it.  I think John and Kris are nice people but this studio experience is not recommended for a beginner. I wish I had taken the time to read all of the previous reviews because it seems someone else had a similar experience.  I am planning to save up and try another studio that is more structured.",

If you see something awesome and you want to try it just ask. I find its great stress relief and with our pot luck today I really got to know some people.  I&apos;m only eight or ten weeks in now and haven&apos;t looked back. If you&apos;re an artist with laser focus or someone that wants to be social this is the place! We also have two awesome dogs that add to the atmosphere. Cheesy and butter ( I guess they like dairy products ) which is great for a dog lover like me. They are not around all the time but really helpful and supportive people are. I am the LEAST artistic person but they helped me make cool stuff. I am happy this place is within walking distance to my house! Give it a try. You won&apos;t regret it.",

My only issue was a big one - it took forever to get anything the class members made bisqued and glazed. If you set something up to be put in the kiln one week it sometimes took 3 weeks or more to get back, then it took weeks more to get back after it was glazed. One woman I took the class with went back week after week once the class was over and was told &quot;it will be back as soon as possible&quot;. Not great considering these classes run over $200!

            "description": "Listen to this. As this is the most sneaky, embarrassing  pathetic attempt at hiding all the terrible traits, habits, behavior/lack of professionalism from the educators at this school. When you come here for a service the &quot;educator&quot; (black lady with short hair) practically tries to force clients into reviewing the school and the service WHILE you are in there in order to try to make you feel bad into writing a good review. How unprofessional is that? I was appalled.  She basically told me I had to write a review NOW while I was getting a pedicure. Why? What if I didn&apos;t want to? What if I didn&apos;t want to leave my bad yet honest review right there and then while all the salon was looking at me and still performing a service? \\n\\nI originally wanted to go to school here but after my visit with them a week ago I changed my mind. One of the educators here (I didn&apos;t catch her name but she is black and has short hair) was giving a student completely inaccurate information on how to apply a product to a clients hair. I was so shocked. She walked around the students saying stupid things that were incorrect. Outdated lady needs to go back to school herself. \\n\\nShe was also very rude and whined a lot instead of teaching with a polite assertive manner she would whine and complain. Real classless lady. She really rubbed me the wrong way as being very mean, catty, almost evil natured. She gives me the creeps. \\n\\nIf I owned this school I would fire her and replace her with literally ANYONE else as I&apos;m sure a random stranger plucked from a group of people would know more about hair dressing than she does. I really never write reviews. But this has been eating at me for an entire week. Lady, if you&apos;re reading this... seek help.",

Its sad to say they cant give the students a chance let alone tell them that they dont have one. Its unfortunate that people who are  asumed to be looked upon as role models have disgraced not only themselves but the place in which they are licensed to work. Empire Beauty School should reevaluate the individuals they put in place to be &quot;licensed educators&quot; to these young adults who will be the future of this field for as long as it lasts. Judging by the attrition rate due to uncalled for degrading disagreements and disputes they wont last long. Any teacher who doubts their pupils are the true failures.\\n\\nEmpire Beauty School Wariwck RI",

I showed up only to find out I&apos;m nowhere on the schedule and the girl I booked the appointment with is already booked for that time.  The person I was talking to was rude and didn&apos;t even offer an apology.  They did offer to take me and just have the student work on both of us (which is very possible when there&apos;s a perm and a hair coloring going at the same time).  Plenty of downtime to focus on the other client.  After waiting for half an hour, nobody came to get me or to ask me whether I&apos;m all set.  I just left.

Are you kidding me? \\nWe learned 3 weeks of cutting, a new cut every day, you don&apos;t learn the angles and their results. \\nSo if someone wants something that goes against &quot;the norm&quot; good luck creating it. \\nBy the time I left I only knew a straight &quot;blunt&quot; cut, long and short layers. \\nWant a bob? Nope, sorry.\\nWant something edgy? Maybe even Miley-ish? Nope, sorry. \\nWant a fringed angle to you face? Oh sorry that&apos;s also out of the question too.\\n\\nWe had students who wouldn&apos;t do projects and passed right along side the hard workers.\\nThe only thing they cared about was you were there for them to get your money. \\nShow up, you&apos;ll pass. \\nGo nap in the lunch room, as long as you&apos;re there and they are getting money, they don&apos;t care how well you do.\\n\\nWe never did real relaxers because they didn&apos;t want to waste product. \\nThey taught us Keratin but didn&apos;t give us a certificate, which is required to purchase the products. \\nThe best scumbag mover, they don&apos;t let students formulate color. You&apos;re not even allowed to measure it. \\nApparently, this is a Warwick Campus thing, it&apos;s been a few years since I&apos;ve graduated so hopefully this has changed. \\nThe director when I went said &quot;students are wasteful and disrespectful&quot; \\nSo for color, we would get our teacher, they would consult and then bring us a bowl of color. Leaving me wondering what and why those were picked for this particular client. \\n\\nWanna hear about our kits? \\nHahaha. All my butterfly clips they charged $9 for broke in week one. \\nMy blow dryer, caught on fire. \\nThey don&apos;t give you a flat iron because you need to learn how to create styles using a blow dryer and not rely on the iron. \\nTheir curling iron, I must say was really good. \\nThe scissors they charge $300 for, are probably at best $50 quality.\\n5 mannequins is also pretty good, but they along with everything else is grossly overpriced.\\n\\nWhen you sign up they tell you &quot;other than things like pens and paper you won&apos;t need a thing, your kit includes it all.&quot; Yeah, lies we were forced to spend money most of us part time workers didn&apos;t have, pretty regularly for projects, or new clips, new brushes &apos;cause theirs are a joke, extensions for lessons, supplies for nail art that they don&apos;t even teach.\\n\\nYou&apos;re supposed to be able to get state board preparation, but because they overbook students my senior class got stuck in the Junior class for about 2-3 months over due. \\nBy the time we got to move up to the class where they teach state board practice, it was almost time to graduate. \\nThey also forced students in the classroom out on to the floor, and they came for seniors first because you have more education and according to them can miss more. We would be in the middle of learning something (which probably wouldn&apos;t do much for us anyways) and the receptionist would come in and say &quot;I need 5 girls&quot; and we would be forced to miss instructional hours to work on clients probably doing things unbenificial to us like a nifty roller set. \\nThey had a asinine policy where clients cannot wait over 10 minutes. Uhm? Have you never walked into a Salon to be told &quot;sorry there isn&apos;t an opening for a half hour.&quot; If you don&apos;t want to wait, be smart and make an appointment. \\nI think this rule was less about customer service, and more about making money.\\n\\nAs for a state boards, the teachers are the ones who grade you, again they pass anyone and everyone. It keeps the schools statistics up. I will tell you first hand, I probably should of failed 75% of it. I didn&apos;t meet the times on anything other than nails, cut and make up. I passed with a grade in the high 80&apos;s. \\nI&apos;m grateful that even with my horrible education I did obtain a license, because it can open doors and is a great benefit. I can also continue my education at my own pace at professional classes, however I&apos;d trade my easily obtained license, for a solid education any day, even if it meant struggling. Because as of now I have so many holes in my education, it&apos;s going to take a while to become useful.\\nI am going to check out Tony And Guy. I went for services and was amazed. I think I may go for half the time, relearn basics like cutting and coloring, and continue on to do what I love. \\nPlease don&apos;t fall victim to this school. Look at your options, read read and read reviews. I rushed into my decision blindly, out of excitement. \\nTwenty thousand dollars, is a lot of money to waste for nothing, so is 1,500 hours of your life. \\nGood luck to future stylists I truly wish you all the best!",

I&apos;m am discouraged and shocked at the what they call an education.\\nFirst there is no a structured curriculum . One day we are doing hair cutting, the next braids, the next pin curls and in the next breath we are having a test on waxing which we&apos;ve never done. When I first started, we were told we weren&apos;t allowed to use any salon product on our mannequin because it was a waste for students and cost the company money, so we used water for everything. \\nThe school is open enrollment. They accept everyone that comes through the door. Majority of the girls  there don&apos;t take this seriously and are only there because their welfare counselor told them &quot;this&quot; was a good idea. They&apos;re always late if they show up at all and disrupt the &quot;class&quot; any chance they can get.\\nOnce (while teaching pedicures) the school refused to allow us to wear the pedicure slippers and told us to tape paper towels on the bottom of our feet. I refused and took a pictures of this horror. The teachers don&apos;t want to be there and talk down to the students.\\nWe were never taught how to properly curl or blow dry hair. We still burn the hair(I&apos;ve been there 10 weeks)\\nThe theory is a joke. I get good grades. When we have test, The girls that fail are allowed to retake the test right after they&apos;ve failed it and the new grade which is higher than mine is kept while their failing grade is dis guarded. I&apos;m not allowed to retake the test because I passed the first time.\\nThis is a reminder you get exactly what you pay for. This school is the cheapest in the state. They said everything I wanted to hear in order to get me to enroll. I&apos;m currently working on attending a school that takes education seriously. I can no longer attended a school that has no interest in producing hair stylists, partakes in unethical practices and could care less if we learn anything at all .\\nGO TO TONI AND GUY better education.",

No makeup was taught to us and everytime we would complain their excuse was, &quot;they are only there to teach the basics&quot; (which we didn&apos;t even get that) we would complain to corporate as a group which just made all the teachers including the director hate us and treat us even more poorly. Total waste of money, we learned nothing and hardly did any hands-on because they were to cheap and said it was a waste of product. Majority was learning through a book. They would over lap classes, which means before your program is done they are starting another program, they move you to another room where you sit and do nothing all day. They tell you to study for your stare exam, but it was just busy work so they could teach the new class. We had so many substitutes and half of them wouldn&apos;t know any answers to our questions.

This school, (not just prov but all Empire schools), only care about profit. Their curriculum makes NO SENSE. Why on earth would you spend one week on hair cutting but FIVE WEEKS on relaxer?..they would have us doing hair cutting and the next week we would do hair dye so your maniquinn had no hair left on it to dye cuz you cut it all...on the week we did makeup, they didn&apos;t teach us anything, they had us partner up and do our partners makeup with really cheap horrible make up that they let everyone use which is unsanitary. when we did facials, they had us laying on two chairs, which is unsafe and uncomfortable....when we did hair dyeing (one week which is not enough time to learn a skill like that) they had a plastic bin full of expired hair dyes, mostly empty, all one blonde shade and weird copper shades no one wanted to use. It&apos;s very hard to be creative with hair color when you only have 11ash and 7 copper red to work with. The students there are mostly ignorant welfare scum...they interrupt the class so that the teacher runs out of time and you never accomplish anything.  there are really only a handful of serious students who will go somewhere some day, but mostly that school is churning out employees for Best Cuts or Fantastic Sam;s....\\n\\nBasically their curriculum is ...teach the students JUST ENOUGH to pass state boards and then send them packing....30,000 dollars and a year later...you&apos;re working at Best cuts making 9.50 an hour. Not worth it...I quit, and if I go back to beauty school I&apos;m going to Tony and Guy or Paul Mitchell.\\n\\ni was enrolled in 2009, my tuition was 16,000 dollars, every month they tuition rate goes up.

The first time I went i went pretty short and was so scared because I dont like letting ppl cute my hair short. The girl cutting my hair didnt do to bad until i straightened it and realized how horrible it looked, i went back and the teacher said she will have another student fix it while straight. the student was sweet and taking her time to fix it and was going over it with the straightner since she sprayed my head with a water bottle. A teacher came by and asked her &quot;what are you doing, you need to hurry up and finish and take more customers.&quot; then looks at me and says &quot; i wasnt going to charge you and now i have to&quot; which i do not believe her whatsoever. and then just walked away. both the student and I felt very awkward and i told her to just stop, ill finish at home. I decided to give it another chance to go get my hair blow dried. my sister gave me a name of a student that was really good, so i made an appt with her in the am. when i called to let them know i was 5 min late, they tell me she left for the day!  so i cancelled and went to Paul Mitchell (and the girl did a great job at my hair) just yesterday my other sister needed a blowout and manicure so she goes, find out the girl scheduled to do her hair never showed up, she waited forever to be seen, a random girl who was being guided the whole time just to trim her hair and the blow out was horrible, she ended up having to fix her hair when she got home and had to rush out to get to work because she ran out of time for the mani. i know its a school but customer service is so important",

This makes it convent for all members of our family me, dad and grandma to pick up/drop off. The teachers are amazing however they seem a bit over worked and seems under staffed. I can&apos;t tell you the numerous times my child has been bitten by other students. I am sure you are thinking &quot;why don&apos;t they pull him out?&quot; Easier said than done currently on several waiting lists for other schools and to be honest my son seems to love it here and his teacher are amazing. I would say it is a little overprice for the toddler programs as there are other facility&apos;s inside private schools cheaper than this place.  They do however provide all meals and snacks.  They do go by their stand at giving quality care to their kids however it seems to be at a cost to other children, those who don&apos;t fight back. Not to mention my child is now picking up bad habits of biting, kicking and not listening due to other students. But as always a trade off for daycare.",

            "description": "I transferred here to work on my bachelors degree. I was a commuter like most of the study body here. It&apos;s a big campus on top of a hill with multiple buildings. I decided to go here because it&apos;s affordable; parents aren&apos;t rich enough to pay for my tuition and I wasn&apos;t the smartest to get a scholarship lol.  \\n\\nI enjoyed my experience here except like most people mentioned, there wasn&apos;t much of a college life. I worked full time and went to school full time so my time was limited to hang around anyway. Although, I didn&apos;t get the college experience, I still felt like I got a good education. I switched majors a couple of times but ended up with one I loved and my advisor, professor, and head of the department was awesome. He guided me in the right direction and was an easy going person. \\n\\nI took night classes for the most part; I&apos;ve had classes until 10 pm. The scheduling was decent for working students. The website was outdated but it got the job done. I was able to pay my bills, schedule courses, and access my grades/transcript.\\n\\nDownfalls, parking was always a nightmare; I would park what felt like miles from the building. Imagine walking alone at night and in the winter! I always felt safe but just be aware of your surroundings and bundle up in the winter. The buildings were old but it got the job done. Classes averaged about 25-30 students. Professors were helpful, friendly, and smart; I&apos;ve had some really strict ones.\\n\\nOverall, if you&apos;re on a budget and want a good education, I recommend going here. Now I&apos;m going back to graduate school and look forward to doing everything online! Those days of going to campus are over. I would definitely send my future children here. (If I still lived in RI).",

I&apos;ve seen a lot since I&apos;ve been here so long.\\n\\nMy previous review still stands, but I&apos;ve also uncovered a lot more awful things about this place, hence the demotion to two stars.\\n\\nThe food is horrendous. Awful. Inedible. They force every student to pay a fee for the dining center every semester. On top of that, you either have to buy a meal plan or pay for the food. Both options are severely overpriced. The dining center has way too many administrators and state employees to pay, so they seriously cut corners with the food.\\n\\nBuildings are falling apart. They did just get some state money to do renovations, but because this is a state institution it&apos;s going to take years before anything actually happens. Yeah, and you look down the road at PC and watch an entire building go up in less than 6 months...\\n\\nThe state unions here do nothing but protect the people who suck at their jobs. If you&apos;re ever trying to get anything important done with your academic records, expect it to be a huge project because nobody cares about you and nobody wants to do any work. \\n\\nSO MANY professors here need to retire, especially in computer science. They&apos;re teaching outdated software and skills that you will never ever use. \\n\\nThis college gears toward working-class families, yet offers hardly any night classes. Balancing work and school is a major struggle as it is, and this place makes it harder. That ONE class you NEED will always be offered in one section at 2pm on Monday and Wednesday so you&apos;ll never be able to have a normal 9-5 day job and get a degree from here. If you can manage to get a decent job on campus, you may have better luck with the work/school balance, but they&apos;re not easy to come across since everybody wants one. \\n\\nNew Hall is beautiful, but the rest of the dorms are gross. The two years that I lived on campus were awful and I was sick all the time from the mold and dust buildup. \\n\\nNice things: BEAUTIFUL, awesome new rec center with free aerobics classes and a pool. Active, involved student media orgs that put out a great newspaper, radio broadcast, and TV station. Student Government that tries really hard to fix stuff, even though they are small in numbers. Lots of free help on campus such as tutoring, counseling, and career advisement. Some really awesome professors that go out of their way to see you succeed.",

            "description": "I had a great time at this school. It took me a while and some going part-time to finish up, but I have to say I was satisfied overall.\\n\\nMy major was HR and there were only two faculty. This can sound like a setup for disaster, but these two faculty members deserve every accolade they receive. Dr. Shani Carter and Dr. Randy DeSimone are two professors I remember fondly, even all these years later.\\n\\nI minored in Mathematics and the faculty there were hit-or-miss. I specifically recall Dr. Humphreys being adept at illustrating complicated math problems graphically, which was very helpful.\\n\\nI was a highly involved student and in general, my experience with being involved with student organizations was a positive one.\\n\\nThe food was mediocre, but I don&apos;t care. It was college. I didn&apos;t expect gourmet meals from a school with no culinary program.\\n\\nMy on-campus job was great.\\n\\nScheduling of classes always worked out favorably, because even in the few times they didn&apos;t fit, the school made accommodations to help my class graduate. It was just a matter of asking!\\n\\nIt&apos;s a little too easy for students to ascend to power in the student organization scene, which leads to a lot of in-fighting and politicking. It&apos;s about what you&apos;d expect, but it&apos;s sitcom-levels of anxiety just to run a club. Very little actually gets done in this regard. You&apos;d expect a high turnover in student leaders, but financial incentives are attached to managing some clubs. If you&apos;re popular and conniving enough, you can leverage enough positions to squat in college while financially accruing enough money to justify it.",

RIC is a nice school for your &quot;foundation.&quot; Low cost, close to home, and I had mostly great professors. They earned a massive grant a few years after I graduated, which was used for beautification/revitalization of the school&apos;s buildings, grounds, and parking lots. It looks like a whole new place now! I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because the dining hall (Donovan) is disgusting. The food is barely edible and many of the items are expired. Look far enough into The Anchor&apos;s (student run newspaper) archives and you&apos;ll see the article I wrote on that very topic. When I attended RIC, most of the buildings were in disrepair, but I was raised in a poor MA city so I was used to it. I found it easy to make friends, both inside and outside the classroom. There&apos;s not much to do on campus if you&apos;re looking for structured events- but you&apos;re only a stones throw from Providence Place Mall, PPAC, Trinity Rep, and some of Providence&apos;s waterfront clubs/pubs. It&apos;s a decent deal for the good quality education. I was able to graduate in 4 years while holding an on campus job. I lived in the dorm the first 3 years and rented an apartment my senior year. I never had a car on campus and - if you land an on-campus job in one of the offices like I did -- you really don&apos;t need one. There&apos;s a RIPTA shuttle with a RIC stop, so you can still get around the city. It&apos;s not perfect, but it&apos;s not terrible, either. I made some lifelong friends, a boyfriend, and some essential progress from childhood to adulthood there. If you&apos;re contemplating attending RIC, do it. I highly recommend it, as you&apos;ll get exposure to many great people while learning quite a bit (from textbooks and life). Did I mention how RIC is also close to India Point?!",

The whole admissions thing can be a nightmare, specially since they use &apos;the common app&apos;. You might end up having to hi to the admissions department a few times, but they are helpful. Once all of that us taken care of, it&apos;s smooth sailing. The tuition is a bargain for instate. They also have regional tuition for folks living in neighboring states. They have a very solid film department, so it&apos;s definitely worth a check out!",

I&apos;ve been in class and sections of ceiling tile have fallen onto desks leaking roof water everywhere. \\n\\nRhode Island College is also fairly homophobic as it goes. Inside the restrooms hate writings can be seen in the stalls, walls, etc. The pride flag was ripped down. A lot of RI trash can be heard spouting off hate.

The professors were all experienced and knowledgable, the classroom sizes were reasonable and varied from 11 to lecture halls, and I felt I was able to balance work, personal, and school life. The admin kinda has their head up their ass when it comes to tracking credits, managing your finances, etc, so just keep a copy of everything in case they misplace credits you&apos;ve already taken or drop you from all your classes because somewhere it didn&apos;t record your payment.\\nParking is absolutely ridiculous. For a commuter school it&apos;s a battle every single day to find a spot even remotely near your class, and I&apos;ve had to walk across campus in snow and rain to get to a class, run in some cases in order to not be late. \\nI never lived here so I&apos;m not sure about student life on campus, but friends of mine lived here and the dorms are standard issue and there does seem to be activities to keep students occupied. \\nThe food is pretty decent at the cafeteria, with vegan and gluten-free options which is very cool. \\nThere&apos;s a cafe with decent coffee and pastries, good pizza, so-so sandwiches. \\nCan&apos;t think of much else to say. For the money (tuition is amazingly inexpensive compared to URI or other colleges) you get a hell of an education. Headaches and hassles with systems and parking.",

It is also good way to get BS/BA for low tuition and move on to graduate studies.\\n        Campus is ok, some buildings are ugly but others are new and cute. It is also not very social or party school and if those features are really important to you don&apos;t go here. This school has more cozy and quite environment and yes, many people like it.

Student body is very diverse- have seen adults in their 50s, weird students, cool students, some are motivated and smart and some are behaving like they are in high school. \\n      The reason I gave four stars is instructors in this school. I have had many great and even outstanding professors here. With such faculty, RIC in my opinion has great potential to become much more than your average school. \\n      Unfortunately, here is no social life.

So with all of these problems, why I am not giving it one star? I am giving it a solid +1 for good people, and another for academic quality. I have met some truly wonderful people here, and due to being a regular fixture in the psych department for more than half a decade, I have become quite friendly with all of the professors. I was a teaching assistant as a graduate student, and my lab students were truly great. \\nIn terms of what I learned, I couldn&apos;t have asked for more. When applying for PhD programs, I have had a lot of difficulty. I think it is because the people judging apps haven&apos;t heard of RIC, or probably think we graduate a bunch of dunces. This elitist mindset is troubling to me. I have come out of RIC prepared to deal with the rigor and intensity of any graduate program. I know this because I have friends in doctoral programs at Brown and Yale that would validate my claim.

They have two sections, one for typically sized comics and one for over sized comic books.  \\n    Also, the student work they showcase is always interesting. \\n\\nAs a bibliophile I feel genuinely lucky to have this library in my home state. And I&apos;ll totally marry someone who has tenure there so I can sneakily read their books till they die.",

The more we read about it though, the more it seemed like a wonderful place for our son. The calming atmosphere, and wonderful routine are things that our son took to immediately. He is a cautious little boy, and very wary of people and spaces, Angel Care has brought out the absolute best in him, and in turn, helped us learn as parents, as we can see first hand how he responds to the slightest changes made. The directness, Catherine Valenti has a remarkable understanding of children and their needs. He has developed so much confidence and his language skills are incredible. He sets his place every day, he shakes hands, he puts things away (within reason- he is a toddler after all!) and although he still will act out sometimes (toddler) he is able to vocalize his frustrations and we, as parents have learned to validate them and work through them alongside our son. You can see him being proud of himself and the work he has done, and it continues on at home.\\n\\nOne of my favorite aspects of Angel Care is that they go outside all year round, and spend lots of time outdoors having messy, muddy, glorious outdoor free time. Inside there is calm, order and routine, and outside lessons continue in a way that seems to be lost in many other places. There is a strawberry patch where my son picks and eats berries. This simple act is so meaningful, as he learns where they come from, how they form from flowers, and that he must wait until they are ripe to pick and eat them. Small life lessons in the fresh air lead to rosy cheeks and long afternoon naps! \\n\\nI simply cannot imagine a better place for my children&apos;s early education.",

Most people were in transition and unemployed but I work full time and was inconvenienced. However I stayed the entire length of the training and then some after to get &quot;registered&quot;. That was not included in the description they sent out which was a one on one basis and only two staffers going around between 15-20 people. I gave them my interests and time availability and was told they&apos;d call up two references I put down. One of my references has to call back multiple times and was never successful in reaching them. Four weeks went on by and I never heard nor saw anything. Then I get an email asking if I was interested in the summer program. I was more annoyed that after four plus weeks I was contacted for a program I didn&apos;t even signed up for and nothing about what I signed up for. I was told that I&apos;d be contacted next academic year since school was out already at this time. Now it is October and I have not heard anything from this group. I have wasted time attending a training workshop for something I clearly I will never be a part of. Furthermore, a personal reference has wasted his time trying to get a hold of the group. Clearly this group lacks respect for people&apos;s time and is poorly managed.",

Easy choice for the only kid of smothering Chinese-American parents.\\n\\nNevertheless, I retain a soft spot for Brown, and it&apos;s got many endearing qualities that are similar to those of the school I went to. First and foremost is its focus on undergraduate education. It&apos;s one of the smaller Ivies, with the lack of a large graduate student population being one of the differentiating factors. This means that professors must be able to teach - and teach well. As a result, the classroom atmosphere is often dynamic and intimate. Moreover, because there aren&apos;t that many graduate students helping professors with research, this provides undergraduates with tremendous opportunities to step up, pick up the slack, and partake in world-class research that they might not otherwise be able to tackle until the graduate level at other schools. Furthermore, the curriculum is quite flexible, with students doing whatever they wish.\\n\\nAlthough the campus is quite compact, it blends in well with its historic Providence surroundings. Classrooms, study and research spaces, professors&apos; offices, key amenities like convenience stores, and the entire city of Providence are all just a short walk away. \\n\\nThese days, with Ivy admissions rates plunging into the single digits, I&apos;d have a much harder time getting in here than I did twenty years ago. If I were a student offered admission here today, I&apos;d definitely give Brown much consideration. Overall, a great occasion for my 1750th review!",

What can I say except this is probably the best school that ever existed. You may think your school is cool but does your school have a class in hieroglyphics? Does it have a book bound in human skin? Does it not make you take gen ed classes because it values learning for the sake of learning? Or does your school let you take classes pass fail because you shouldn&apos;t feel the pressure of a grade when you&apos;re learning something new? My alma mater has that and more. It has over 100,000 beautiful memories for me during my four years and I&apos;ve never been to a place which had more amazing people in my life. I was so lucky to call that university home and it will always hold a special place in my heart.",

I would come back again to explore the area around the campus. \\n\\nMetered parking is all around, so finding a spot to park is just a matter of luck and timing. While we were driving away we spotted a Kung Fu Tea that we wanted to grab a drink at, but it didn&apos;t seem convenient to find a parking space (all the street parking was taken) and the neighboring bank parking had restriction signs posted. \\n\\nWill definitely come back again to explore should we be in Providence.",

Brown&apos;s campus was more integrated into a small city feel. The students were a mixed bag of nerdy, preppy, dazed, and snotty. For example, I held a door open for a girl and she just stared at me with no &quot;thank you&quot; as she walked by.

Of course, Rhode Island hospital is off campus on the other side of town (I make it sound far but really it&apos;s only like 5 minutes away). The school sits next to RISD so in addition to the world class departments that they have on campus, they share some of the great art community that RISD has to offer. \\n\\nCampus is probably smallest of the Ivies, but it&apos;s nestled in one of the best college towns I have seen. As you walk through the school, you have to walk down Thayer street and see the great restaurants and tiny stores that the area has to offer. \\n\\nBrown as with many of the other Ivies has solid finances because of loyal alumni and generous friends who believe in the mission of the school. Of course, Rhode Island (especially Providence!) has much to offer and it doesn&apos;t overwhelm you at all. Who knows? I may be here for the long run! (shhh don&apos;t tell California that!)",

And I have been intrigued by the attention it has gotten as well over the years, most recently for the selection of Ruth Simmons as president (she is leaving very soon).\\n\\nKnown since the &apos;60s as the hippest of the Ivy League, with the most flexibility and openness in its curriculum, Brown is also one of the most smallest in the group both in terms of numbers of students and actual campus size.\\n\\nThe campus is small, compact, and has many handsome red brick Georgian architecture.  The atmosphere is laid-back but studious.  I enjoyed spending time at the John D. Rockefeller Library while my sister went to classes.\\n\\nMy sister had nothing but praise for the school when she went there.\\n\\nI am disappointed by a relatively recent event, though.\\n\\nRuth Simmons, its president, made a startling remark to Mike Wallace in his interview of the former. She recounted a slight she experienced from a faculty member at Harvard where she was doing her Ph.D. in Romance languages and literature, her field being17th century French literature.\\n\\nMike Wallace gave her an incredulous look--raised eyebrows and all--and actually said something like, &quot;17th century French literature? How arcane! Whatever for?&quot;\\n\\nMs. Simmons was apparently so caught up in her being able to vent her woeful tale of racial discrimination that she did not offer one whit of a defense of her field of graduate studies. 17th century France was the most powerful nation in the world, and French cultural domination is attested by a roll-call of the most celebrated intellects of that era: Pascal, Descartes, Moliere, Corneille, Racine, La Fontaine...this was the era of Louis XIV--le roi soleil--and Versailles and the birth of modern diplomacy.\\n\\nThe 17th century without France would be like the 20th century without the United States.* And we today are a lot closer to the 17th century in our outlook, customs, and institutions than we are to the time of Jesus Christ or the gladiators.\\n\\nGranted Americans don&apos;t generally know much about world history, but Ms. Simmons&apos;s bemused silence vis-a-vis Mr. Wallace was pretty disheartening. In essence, she silently endorsed the prevalent but parochial attitude among our countrymen that world culture and history are primarily American. No need to dig further than Neils Armstrong, Martin Luther King, Jr., Abraham Lincoln, Mark Twain, or George Washington, do we?\\n\\nLet&apos;s hope that Brown&apos;s next president (Ms. Simmons is resigning her at the end of the current academic year) will offer a more spirited defense of the humanities, not just Aime Cesare, David Diop, etc.\\n\\nWe are built on the shoulders of those who came before us. An education ought to be inclusive. Unfortunately, Brown may offer too much of a &quot;select-what-you-will&quot; (and by extension, &quot;ignore-what-you-will&quot;) approach.\\n\\n* * The following century (&quot;Le siecle des lumieres&quot;)--but equally unheard of by most Americans-- would bring with it both the Enlightenment and the American and French revolutions.\\n\\nThe Enlightenment is the anti-thesis of what George W. Bush (and his co-religionists) stands for, but is impossible to understand without studying the 17th century.",

The topics range from secret fetishes to virginity. Anyone curious about sexual health should feel comfortable consulting Megan or the staff, because it is an easy-going atmosphere. The Center is like an encyclopedia that one can actually walk into. The knowledge is endless, and any question is welcome. The Center takes the shame away from those sexuality questions that you cant really ask anyone else. There truly isn&apos;t anywhere else like it, in my opinion. If you are planning on having an internship at The Center expect a small group of interns that help you grow and learn new things as well.

It is about shedding light on the racial and systemic injustices that our black communities and neighbors endure on a daily basis - it is meant to teach, to educate, to reform. If you are threatened or worried about something on a t-shirt, you&apos;re likely someone who needs to step back to reevaluate yourself and your privileges.

Too bad this place isn&apos;t it! I&apos;m seeing so many reviews say things like how this childcare center is correct in how they acted because they should just let kids be kids. What? Why? You want to put blinders over your kids eyes to what is going on in the world? That&apos;s exactly how you create ignorant people. We should be teaching our children about what&apos;s going on - not hiding them from it. BLM isn&apos;t political. It&apos;s humanity. \\n\\nThis school deserves its one star and I hope that nobody sends their kids here. It seems they lack basic values of Christianity. What if I wore a shirt that said &quot;Breast Cancer Sucks.&quot; Is that a political view too? Does it mean that breast cancer is the only cancer that matters?

Located on the corner of Camden Ave. x  Trinidad Dr., the Almaden branch is the corner suite with the banner outside. Eye Level offers classes in Math, English, and Korean for K-9 levels. It is a self-directed learning environment where students study materials approved by South Korean parent company, Daekyo.  Currently, Eye Level has approximately 2.5 million members in 16 countries, and as part of the No Child Left Behind Act, Eye Level offers tutoring known as Supplemental Education Services (SES) in California.\\n\\nI&apos;m here twice a week, so I see Eye Level not only as a resource for reviewing knowledge, but also an opportunity for students get ahead of their class. Eye Level administers a diagnostic test to evaluate students&apos; level, and has a curriculum for each level. There is a separate classroom for Math, English, and Korean, where tutors provide guidance to students. In turn, the owner Ms. Park reports each student&apos;s progress to their parents at regular intervals. Students who are good at Eye Level are rewarded with prizes for every 100 &quot;Enopi Dollars&quot; they earn through getting good scores on quizzes, homework, and comprehension tests. Students benefit from positive reinforcement from their tutors, Ms. Park, and parental support. Therefore, I think Eye Level has a very good system for students to develop confidence in themselves and supplement the subjects they study in school.\\n\\nOther learning centers in the area include Tutoring Club and ThinkTank Learning. Tutoring Club specializes in specific high school subjects while ThinkTank Learning boasts miracles for getting college applicants into their dream school.",

Manny has already created an outline with priority steps to take in order start this process in the most affordable way possible.

He recommended several private colleges that each offered our son over $100,000 in scholarships at schools that were in cities he was interested in living in and with majors he was passionate about.  Our son ended up in the honors program at a wonderful private college in Boston and he just finished his first year! He is getting over $140,000 in merit based financial aid that is guaranteed over the 4 years he is in college and he is excited to be at a school that truly meets his needs and is cheaper than the UC&apos;s.  We had no problem signing up with Manny to help our daughter find her dream school who is now a junior in high school.  He is worth every cent!",

Manny helped us choose colleges that had high academic rates and were generous with Merits. He helped us with Financial aid and taxes and how to get the most money. At times I reached out to him 10pm and he was still available and ready to help. I will definitely recommend his services to any student who is looking to apply for college .",

However, once I went through College Planning ABC, I was able to improve the quality of my essays, get support for financial aid, and overall have a less stressful college application process. I&apos;m now happily a mechanical engineering major in UC Santa Barbara, and I&apos;m grateful for the support College Planning ABC provided me on my journey here.",

I enjoyed it so much that I invited several friends and attended a second session with my then, sophomore &amp; freshman. Never too early!\\n\\nWhat makes Manuel&apos;s (Manny) approach to college financial planning so successful is his ability to get through to each student, understanding their strengths and weaknesses. His personality is a huge factor in why I chose to work with Manny. He has a no-nonsense approach, keeping open lines of communication with parent/student. I was always kept in the loop with all of my son&apos;s appointments, deadlines, etc. \\n\\nThe college application process can be a daunting maze, with each school asking for something different from each of their applicants. Manny knows this maze like the back of his hand, offering new, up-to-date information on college requirements, SAT/ACT testing, essays, etc. \\n\\nWith Manny&apos;s help, my oldest will be attending his dream school in the fall, all the while making it very affordable to do so. I&apos;ve got another senior that is currently working with College Planning ABC and my daughter right behind, will also be under Manny&apos;s guidance in the near future. College Planning ABC made college affordable for my son and I. If you&apos;ve got a high school student in your life wanting to pursue his/her college education, reach out to Manny and his team at College Planning ABC.",

With so many new rules and changes, college applications was so confusing.   With such short notice before the deadline for college applications in November 2019, Manny was able to guide my child to successfully meet the college applications deadline as well as helped my child with editing appealing college essays.    With Manny&apos;s help, my child was on target with deadlines &amp; college choices.  That made a tremendous difference for us.  Manny is a life saver.   I really enjoyed working with him too.  He is so accessible &amp; available.  He also helped us with scholarships and that helped us saved a lot of money.   Thank you Manny for all your help!

No sales pitch happened, Manny (speaker) just really have a passion of showing you the in and outs of saving money in college and how to minimize your cost by applying for private and federal grant or scholarships and how to go about it. Its tons of good information, and what&apos;s more, he offered an hour of complimentary one on one meeting in his office in San Jose.

His approach to the process was what we needed to keep us all on track for both girls. Both my daughters attended his workshops and classes and knew what they needed to do and when it needed to get done. This in itself was a huge help. Both ended up at Chapman University. My oldest attended there first and my second daughter followed suit. With\u00a0 Mannys expertise he had me go back to the school and petition to get my daughters merit amount raised based on her academic accomplishments.  Everyone was afraid that they would revoke admission if I pushed too hard but Manny knew what they offer for what GPA and he was correct and we ended up almost doubling her merit! That was a huge chunk of money for us to have saved. Who would have thought after you get accepted that merit was even negotiable. Manny did! Again.... I can&apos;t say enough wonderful stuff about him and his energy. Both my daughters adored him. They both since graduated college. One with a double major in 4 years and the other\u00a0 in three years and walked together. Manny followed them on their college progress and still keeps in touch today. If you have kids prepping for college I would highly recommend him.",

From our prior plan of living at home attending the local college to the current visits to private schools to DECIDE which one to attend, my son&apos;s life is forever changed.\\n\\nFrom two hard working parents who would never have been able to navigate the academic jungle without Manny, our gratitude is endless.",

My chest started hurting and is still hurting now. My throat definitely feels off. Sawdust is not a joke. Pack a dust mask for this class at the least.\\n\\nOtherwise, really enjoyed the class!

Truly a gift to the program.\\n\\nHowever, the CTE supervisor was unprofessional at the end while some of us were left looking for our own externships. While many clinics stopped accepting externs due to Covid, that does not give a representative of the school the right to be rude and condescending to its students. The newsletter sent out after our graduation also had wrong information. It said I gained my employment with a large hospital after going through the program and their Externship provided by the school. This is a lie. I had already been employed by the hospital for 4 years PRIOR to taking the course and remained in the same job position following graduation. I also had found my own externship even though at the informational meeting about the program, it was clearly stated we were not supposed to find our own and that the school would provide us with the externship. There was at least one other student where the newsletter stated the same lies about her employment being due to the school&apos;s program and externship. \\n\\nWould I recommend this program to my friends?

They learnt 3 to 4 projects. But, she enrolled for the next sewing class soon after finishing the 101 and had a bad experience. She said they hardly taught her anything. You just buy patterns and sew in the class and there is nothing that they teach.",

I signed up for two classes - both woodworking - and the class that wasn&apos;t cancelled (making a cutting board) was fantastic. This review is for the office because due to their mistakes, I won&apos;t be taking another class.  \\n\\nI registered for the Adirondack chair class and apparently there weren&apos;t enough people so the class was cancelled. No one called though son I still went to the school. Thankfully the teacher was there and he told me about the class situation. The school was going to wait a week to see if more people would sign up but unfortunately they didn&apos;t. I did receive a call that week but now, over three weeks later, there still hasn&apos;t been a refund. I&apos;ve called and emailed and the office&apos;s response was that it was refunded - even though according to my bank statement, it hasn&apos;t. \\n\\nIt&apos;s too bad, you can&apos;t just pay the teacher the night of the class and skip the mess of the registration and office.",

The ladies in the office were friendly to me and answered all my questions.\\n\\n$80 for a 5 week sewing course? Can&apos;t beat that price!\\nSewing machines are in the class. You will have to spend an extra $50-$80 on sewing supplies. \\n\\nThe sewing class:\\nSusan Sjostrom is listed as the instructor but she also has a sidekick named Susan that offers assistance.\\n\\nI took this class because I have ZERO sewing experience. I barely knew the diffference between a bobbin and a button.\\n\\nI recommend that you take their class if you have SOME experience and are looking to improve. I was lost EVERY class and only finished one project out of the 5 they had (one for each week). \\n\\nThe ladies had sewing jargon/terms roll off their tongues, but didn&apos;t really offer visuals for the terms. I constantly found myself going home and using YouTube to figure out what the heck they were talking about.\\n\\nHalf the time I felt like a moron because they gave out oral directions and I had no reference point to really understand what they meant or how to get started. So when directions were given I&apos;d go back to my machine and cry (ha...just kidding). \\n\\nThe only time I felt liked I really, truly learned was when Susan Sjostrom sat at my sewing machine and EXPLAINED everything to me as she did it. It was so, so awesome! \\n\\nThere are only 2 instructors, so you&apos;ll have to wait awhile to get questions answered if you have them. \\n\\nAt any rate, you can&apos;t go wrong with Santa Clara Adult Education.",

            "description": "The 3 stars are for the location and the school director. I tried to take an accounting class here in the evenings and I want to WARN anyone that wants to do the same. The instructor is from India with a HEAVY Indian accent. She has a masters in accounting and teaches FAST! so fast your head will spin from trying to compute what she just said to keeping up via instruction. \\nExample she went through one chapter in 30 minutes. How do I know? because I timed her. Then she wants you to group up and Work together. I mean everyone is just as lost how can we help each other? \\nWe the students don&apos;t really ask questions because 1. She does not understand what we ask. 2. We&apos;re so lost in trying to keep up and decipher what she is trying to say/teach. We don&apos;t know what to ask.\\nAfter her examples on the white board she never asks if we had any questions. She just moves on, quickly.\\nBeing in her class reminds me of a fast paced school like Heald College or the old Sawyer business college etc.\\nThis class will be good for the people who are used to the Indian (India) accent and/or have some experience in accounting already. For the beginners this class will Challenge you to the fullest for the reasons stated above.\\nThe instructor does not check homework. You have to check your own. If you do not check your homework via a Teachers edition binder she has and you are doing it wrong. You will never know if you are doing it right or not. She encourages us to snap photos of the answers from the teachers edition binder. The only issue with this is. She usually shows up for class 5 minutes ahead of class. You do not have time if someone else has the books (there are 3) (so you stay lost)\\nShe swoops the books up quickly as to deter you from checking homework after class. Again, she is in a hurry to go home and she does leave Right On Time and not a minute after.\\nThe instructor is not very welcoming or friendly. So it&apos;s hard to approach her before or after class. She sits at her desk with no eye contact. (head down) Don&apos;t have to put up a (Do Not Disturb Sign here)\\nWhen I do ask a question she does not understand what I am trying to say. She seems frustrated. She is very impatient with us and you can feel it. #discouraging\\nThis class  will set you back just under $200.00 Class plus books, working papers.\\nThe only way I kept up was good old Youtube videos. I am sure she is a good person, but not everyone can teach. Does not matter how many degrees you have. If you are an instructor. You must have patience and speak English properly or at least slower and make an effort so We (students) can understand.\\nIt took me awhile to understand the meaning of proprietor from her. Instead of saying &quot;Only&quot; she says One-ly business person and makes reference to business assets with examples of &quot;bags of wheat&quot; I kid you not.\\nFor the people, specially beginners. I would suggest before you fork out all that money. Ask the director of SCAE if you could do a sit in first before making a commitment to sign up and fork out $200\\nI&apos;m just glad. I took that class to get an understanding oppose to &quot;Needed&quot; the class for a career. \\nYou have been informed. Now make up your own mind.\\nAgain, for the record. This review is nothing personal against the teacher&apos;s personality as a person. It&apos;s strictly business.\\n\\n***I think it&apos;s very interesting how YE G. only has one review LOL I don&apos;t think my personal experience regarding the Accounting class was ridiculous. I&apos;m just keeping it real. It&apos;s difficult for us Americans who&apos;s native tongue is English to try and comprehend heavy accents from ESL and second, try to learn something new. Update: 2016 Santa Clara Adult Ed is bringing in a new instructor this Summer. The other instructor received too many complaints. \\n\\nYE G. if you are the instructor I had the experience with (coincidence?) This review has nothing to do with your personal character as a person. You yourself mentioned how difficult it was for us to understand you remember? You understand Accounting book theory. But you have no prior Accounting experience in the real world (Those are your words) I suggest taking classes on how to improve your English skills and slow your speech down. You will be a more efficient teacher.  I&apos;m letting other people know what they can expect and how difficult it was for some of us students to understand you. (we spoke after class) before they fork out over $200.00 for just this one of three classes. No hard feelings towards you. I&apos;m just being honest.",

I&apos;ve taken photo classes in other schools but the quality and value I get over here at SCAE with Noella is the best.It&apos;s not just one day workshops/classes but rather a series so you can break down the concepts such as exposure/composition/flash.  Then because you have a chance to submit your own photos week after week... you get feedback and she can tell you what to fix. That&apos;s really hard to beat. Also, she hardly brings her camera in her classes so that she focuses on you, the student, and making sure you are not being left behind. In some field trips, she shadows you around and gives you challenges on photos and you have to achieve it before she moves on. My skills have leveled up since I started classes with her. And did I mention it&apos;s super cheap?  It&apos;s a crime not more students sign up.",

And it&apos;s fun in the class I think she explained very clearly, even she has Indian accent I can still understand what she said as I&apos;m a foreigner here. \\n     When you want to leave earlier with reasonable reason she&apos;ll let you go, but she always come very early and finish on time. I don&apos;t know why fullmoon T gave her such negative evaluation, maybe he or she just not so into accounting..",

As a complete newbie to sewing, Sue &amp; Sue were so encouraging and provided many handy tips and tricks that they accumulated over 20+ years of sewing.  It&apos;s that bit of knowledge that is hard to find in a YouTube video or a book...  you really need to be there with an experienced hand to figure out all the proper ways to really finish your project.  With Sewing 101, you&apos;re given projects to do which are wonderful to do...  with Sewing 102, you are given much more flexibility in your projects.

I dont even want to go into the teacher&apos;s many faults, but suffice it to say, I dropped the class, didnt get any money back. I think you do have the option of transferring the money you spent to another class, if it doesnt work out, or the class is canceled. the teachers get paid based on receiving the minimum number of applicants, so the classes get cancelled if only, say 10 people enroll, and they have determined that there needs to be 12. however, the classes are very inexpensive, and can teach you a lot if you have the time and the interest in a subject. \\n\\nI totally support adult/community education and everything it stands for. this location shares the school buildings with two continuation schools, a jazzercise school and some other things, including a large program for developmentally disabled adults. there is a parent participating pre-school here as well. \\n\\nmost of the class participants are retired, altho they run the gamut with a fair amount of stay-at-home moms and others. They run tons of classes on network/etc certification, GED classes, knitting classes, you name it. All of the ESL classes are free!\\n\\nThe community garden may be the best part of it. you can basically rent a plot for 2.5 months. this comes with free classes on saturday mornings of gardening activities led by my mother herself. not to be biased, but she is very informational and enthusiastic. her classes include all sorts of topics, from building compost piles, and other earth-friendly activities, to making garden statues, edible flowers, learning about all sorts of plant varieties and growing tips, etc. It is not only informative, but very community-oriented, a great way to get to know your neighbors. The garden also hosts educational field trips for local school kids, as well as a raised bed plot for the developmentally disabled adults in wheelchairs. \\n\\nif you want to know more about the classes, drop into the office on weekdays, the ladies there are very helpful. if you are interested in the community garden, come by any Saturday from 9-12, the gates are open and people would love to show you their plots. The program runs for 10 weeks, it costs $35, there are 4 sessions a year.",

However, the greatness stopped there. \\n\\nI reached out via Yelp on 10/21/21 to submit an inquiry and get more information. I got a quick response on Yelp and was told by the owner to call the office. I immediately called and dealt with their receptionist who was less than helpful. Didn&apos;t understand why I was inquiring. I explained I wanted to make an appointment for my child and get more information. She said she would send an intake form and that it would be reviewed within 24-48 hours by the owner. She asked how I wanted to pay and I said I could either use insurance or pay out of pocket. I said I was willing to do whichever was faster as I only cared about getting an appointment, not the cost. She said okay and to send insurance info because they could quickly verify whether or not to use it. \\n\\nOn 10/22/21 I sent back the completed intake along with pics of our insurance cards. \\n\\nThen.... Radio silence. \\n\\nI was notified on 10/23 that my email still had not been opened. I then called several times over the next week to Inquire and follow up. Was told they were &quot;looking into it and waiting for the owner to review the intake form.&quot;\\n\\nOn 11/9/21 I messaged on Yelp because I was not getting anywhere. The owner apologized and said the admin would be calling me. \\n\\nI got an email notification that my email had been opened by them for the first time since it was sent 3 weeks prior. I got a long excuse and was asked if I was still interested and to provide insurance info. I then also got a call. I restated that I had ALREADY provided the insurance pics in my original 10/22 email and that all I cared about what the appointment, not the cost. And it faster to just pay out of pocket. She was confused and said she didn&apos;t see my info and would look again. I replied back in my email as well saying all info had already been provided. No apology.  Nothing. She then stated she would now pass on my info to the billing department. \\n\\nRadio silence again. \\n\\nAnd now on 12/2 I get an email saying they don&apos;t have an insurance contract with Health Net. They also don&apos;t know when they will be able to renew it. Nothing about paying out of pocket or apology. Just &quot;Thanks!&quot;\\n\\nA month and a half later and a total waste of time.

We had the pleasure of working with Alissa and Thao and they were both great with supporting my son for his speech delay. They provided various strategies and gave us homework to continue building his language skills at home every week. Alissa is really passionate about the field of speech language pathology and I trust her 100% with my son. They were patient and caring and never gave up with my son.",

While we are thrilled that he met his goals, we were sad to leave. From our first phone call, all the way to our last day, we had nothing but positive experiences. Everyone was kind, welcoming and professional. My son worked with Ms. Simone and she was amazing. She always had fun activities planned that kept him engaged and he was excited to return each week.

Alissa and Merrett gave their advices  me to follow up for my son at home. \\n \\nMy son has improved in interactions with others such as making calls to stay away from people saying inappropriate things at school as well as saying &apos;no&apos; and expressing he was not happy to his peers.\\n\\nMerrett made a note book with the lesson summary with HW to follow up.  She reviewed and explained practices to followed up with me and my son at the end of each sessions.  She also praised things he did well and note the improvements he made. She was patient and professional.  Some of the lessons were &apos;think it ,say it&apos;; monitor people&apos;s reactions as you are describing your interests; stop and ask if they are interested; appropriate vs. inappropriate in different situations; etc.   These activities also helped to self reflect, so he started to watch his own actions during conversations to reflect his intention and attention.  She also had him practice with staff in the office and play game.  \\n\\nBTW, the staff, Melanie and Tracy, were wonderful.  They got the practicing buddy role down!   Tracy&apos;s efficient in her communication in billing.   Melanie is friendly and remembers everyone visiting the office and their schedules.  \\n\\nHighly recommend Keys to Communication.",

At the time, she was 4 years old and did not want anything to do with any doctor. The doctors simply stated that she could not be assessed. Alissa came to our home and was successful in conducting an assessment.  We could not be happier with the beautiful child our granddaughter has blossomed into. She has no problem telling her Pops that she wants In and Out or telling her daddy that it&apos;s time to get on the trampoline. Last night she sent her uncle to 31 flavors.  We are loving it!  Alissa keep up the wonderful, transformational work that you have going on!",

When he first started, his expressive language was very poor. Nobody could ever understand what he was saying. Within a month, we noticed tremendous progress as he was able to say certain sounds he couldn&apos;t say before. Ms. Amy provided weekly homework, which helped SO much! She&apos;s an extremely caring and fun loving person. My son looked forward every week to seeing her! She made each session fun and my son&apos;s speech improved drastically by her methods. Due to scheduling conflicts and schools reopening, I needed to change my son&apos;s time slot. Ms. Amy wasn&apos;t available for that timeslot, so he started seeing Ms. Mikaela! \\n\\nMs. Mikaela was also amazing! She was very patient (my son likes to talk a lot!) and friendly with him, and he always had great memories of their session. \\n\\nMy younger son is currently being seen by Ms. Merrett. My son is very shy but she has had such a great effect on him that he instantly goes to play/ learn with her. It shows that he has no hesitation and he enjoys their time together. We have seen such an amazing improvement and Ms. Merrett always has helpful feedback and provides tangible advice for improvement! We are extremely happy with all of the instructors our kids have had, as well as their commitment to improving their communication. They are without a doubt deeply committed, knowledgeable, and kind professionals.",

Amy did a fantastic job making the sessions fun and playful which allowed my son to connect and want to work very hard during his sessions. In just a short 8 months, our son was able to catch up and graduate from speech therapy. *Please note, there was a lot of &quot;homework&quot; we as parents needed to do with our son but Amy helped streamline this process with the wonderful sessions and guidance she provided us! Our son was always so happy and excited to go see &quot;Ms. Amy!&quot; and couldn&apos;t wait to get into the car to go see her. Ms. Amy will always have a special place in our hearts and we cannot thank her enough for all her hard work and expertise that she bestowed\u00a0upon us! We highly recommend Amy Nguyen at Keys To Communication! We also wanted to give a little shout out to the receptionist, Ms. Melanie, who was always so happy to greet us before our appointment.

This office followed all Covid protocols, Melanie from front desk is great and friendly. Melanie was very communicative when he was first referred and follow up regarding the short waitlist.  Stanford told me 9 month waitlist for speech at the time. My son&apos;s therapist Amy interacted well with him, was patient even on the days he didn&apos;t want to do certain things. My son&apos;s speech was getting better and now at 3 year old 3 months. It&apos;s exponentially better. I can see a huge difference with him versus his preschool friends. He can have long sentences, full on conversations, understanding and communicating what he wants. We stopped going in January my husband was worried about Covid and Amy thought he has improved so much that it was ok to stop. Since we had BlueShield HMO, they told us exactly what the doctor should write on the referral and billing was not an issue. His weak oral motor issues are still ongoing as we see it in his feeding habits, we may probably need speech again in the future. I&apos;ll definitely go back.  Now that I&apos;m having so much difficulty finding a quality OT place again that take my insurance for sensory issues; I&apos;m really appreciating this place and had wished they had OT too.  I know those 6 month of therapy is going to help him advance into successful life as a child going to school in later years. Thanks Keys to Communication team. Dealing with Stanford OT referral was a nightmare and we got in after 6 months of waiting and billing was a nightmare. Our Insurance called Stanford multiple times to have them run the insurance so I wouldn&apos;t get any bills. Stanford OT we had was great if you can ever get in but it does not feel close knit like Keys to communication team.",

We&apos;ve been particularly happy with the emphasis on deeper conceptual understanding of material, so it&apos;s not just rote memorization and regurgitation. Word problems were a significant part of Kindergarten math, and I&apos;m positive I wasn&apos;t doing word problems that early when I was a kid. The teachers and administration are very receptive to feedback and concerns that inevitably crop up during the school year. We&apos;ve been happy with the way they&apos;ve handled issues, and clearly customer service is an important part of their philosophy. \\n\\nTuition is on the higher range of private schools, but in this case you truly do get what you pay for.",

My only complaint is the tuition but I guess it&apos;s fair market price to pay.  My child is very satisfied with Harker and adjusted really well.  Each subject has a dedicated teacher who&apos;s able to give more to teaching and the children.  I would consider one teacher from last year as a star teacher who gave that much more to teaching with passion.  Each child is able to flourish in his/her own way.   At least for the lower school unhealthy competition is not encouraged.  Every child is respected and the goal is to aid every child in the discovery of their passion, strength and learning.  Homework and curriculum is suitable for the grade level. Because my child did not have private school education before coming to Harker, I tried to help him with homework and bridge any gap as needed, which helped ease his stress and anxiety and help him catch up with other students.  Based on what I observed, other parents did not need to help the children with homework (which the school discourages anyway).   The school sends report card three times in the year, where every homework and class work would count to show a general picture of the children&apos;s effort and achievement.  My child asked me why we did not start him at Harker earlier, which I did regret about.  I don&apos;t think Harker is worth every penny you paid for, but it is the best choice in the South Bay Area and therefore worthy of the investment in the children&apos;s life long learning and education.",

            "description": "I strongly discourage those whose kids have no siblings in the Harker to apply for this school. If your kids have no siblings already in the Harker, the chance of your kids to be admitted is very slim, if not impossible. The destruction of your kids&apos; self-esteem and confidence because of failing to be admitted in the Harker will be disastrous, and will affect your kids&apos; future forever.\\n\\nHarker publicly declares that they DO have policy to have higher priority to enroll the kids who have sibling already in the Harker. There are only a few openings every year, and there are more applicants whose siblings are already in the Harker. Therefore, if your kids have no sibling in the Harker, it is extremely difficult for your kids to be admitted, no matter how excellent your kids are. My kid has several classmates and friends who have siblings in the Harker. They are not as excellent as my kid, and they never work hard for the entrance tests. But they told my kid that they don&apos;t need study hard and they could go to the Harker whenever they wanted to go. Although a top student, my kid has much less chance to be admitted. Frustrated, my kid no longer studies hard as before, and spends more time in TV and computer games, saying &quot;It&apos;s useless to study hard. I don&apos;t need work hard since you&apos;re rich!&quot;. We always educate our kids to study hard to be successful in the future. But now my kid doesn&apos;t believe me anymore. \\n\\nIf your kids have no sibling in the Harker and you want to send your kids to Harker, you need think twice. Not only will it waste your time, energy and money to prepare for their tests, more destructively it will ruin your kids&apos; future most likely.",

The education is top notch, the sports programs are competitive and the afterschool supervision allows working parents a safe and educational environment for their kids to enjoy unitl pick up time. The teachers care about each student and the development of their education. I am looking forward to sending both my kids to Harker in the next few years.",

My child&apos;s teachers have been excellent and I have never felt that my child has been pushed by the school so much as some stated.   I think most of the pushing is from the parents themselves.  The children are well behaved and taught to be very respectful towards others.  There seems to be good communication between the teachers, parents, and counselors to make sure the children are doing well academically, socially, and emotionally.  Harker also provides a nice balance of field trips, outings, etc.  Extremely expensive, however well worth the money!    Due to the high cost of the tuition, I had contemplated on whether it would be a wise decision.  So far, I have no regrets.  I think Harker is building a wonderful foundation for a lifetime of learning.   Most of the children here successfully move on to an elite college and are more than well prepared for college.",

            "description": "We stopped by San Jose State University so my daughter could take a look and get a feel for the campus. She is considering applying here since they offer the major she is interested in. We found parking at the large garage just off campus. It&apos;s definitely much more compact after touring UC Davis. It feels a bit sketchy near the outer edge of campus and surrounding area just off campus. Keep in mind that it is a small square campus plopped in the middle of a city, near the downtown area. It might not feel safe walking alone through campus at night. Perhaps it&apos;s for these reasons that most of the campus buildings require a key card for access/entry (unlike UC Davis where all buildings were unlocked and accessible to visitors).  And perhaps the university may also wish to discourage non-students and transient people from surreptitiously auditing classes. You should schedule a guided tour with if you want to see more of the campus that is not easily accessible to someone without a key card.\\n\\nOpen/accessible areas include the Wellness Center, which has unlocked doors and access to restrooms. The library and the Student Union are also open to the public. You&apos;ll find a large food court, plus restrooms, at the Student Union. There are also restaurants (and coffee) a short walk from campus if you don&apos;t like any of the food offerings at the Student Union. It is very easy to walk from building to building because the campus is small and not so spread out. The residence halls (dorms) are at one corner of campus. From the outside, some of these dorms are large, tall, modern looking buildings that you might mistake for a hotel. \\n\\nSJSU had the &quot;Send Silence Packing&quot; exhibit on suicide awareness &amp; prevention, on the day I visited. It consisted of a bunch of backpacks placed on the large lawn area. Each backpack represented someone&apos;s suicide story; many backpacks had a photograph of the person who lost their life to suicide. There was also a tent with counselors. \\nhttps://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=i6k9Qfem1079786UNipjqA&amp;userid=isQotFiKU_S_TI4Qt4MtMQ\\n\\nBoyce Gate\\nhttps://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=WpYT33KGKC1IgCPrXMzXpw&amp;userid=isQotFiKU_S_TI4Qt4MtMQ\\n\\n.",

Very poorly ran so be aware. \\n\\nThe student services center staff is there to help students, period point blank!. The bursars office/registrar are a nightmare to get ahold of, and when you do they have little to NO answers for you. They will loop you to other people, have you coming down in person more than you need to be. \\n\\nThere&apos;s no way these people should be working in education. They have no passion, no love to help students. Instead they tell you they have no answers. I don&apos;t remember a time where I have been HELPED by a staff member. I always have to find a way around, talk to a dean or higher up. It&apos;s really sad and makes things hard for those enrolled.\\n\\nThankfully I won&apos;t be coming here anymore and I can let this go!

I get to meet with faculty, attend special lectures, chat with students, and review and provide feedback to the senior design projects.  I also provide feedback on the curricula and provide an industrial perspective on skills and behaviors we&apos;d like to see in new graduates.\\n\\nIn chemical engineering undergrad, the final class is a team project to design a chemical process using all the engineering knowledge you&apos;ve picked up in the past 3 years plus being able to calculate the economics.  You must also be able to clearly articulate the project with a poster, oral presentation and/or written report.  Its not necessarily the most difficult class in the major, but its the most comprehensive and most realistic in terms of what to expect in the workplace.  SJSU deserves credit for giving a wide variety of projects to choose from, from traditional chemicals to semiconductors, biofuels, carbon capture and minerals.  Best of all, many of these projects have diverse industry advisors and sponsors which adds realism and a sense of credibility to the project.  \\n\\nThe Student Union is a pretty nice one, way better than both my alma maters!  The SJSU has a Starbucks, pool hall, bowling alley, and a full food court similar to shopping malls.  Yes, a Panda Express, Jamba Juice, a Halal place, etc.  There seems to be plenty of seating everywhere and flatscreen TVs running the latest news and sports.\\n\\nDefinitely reminds me of the trials and tribulations of getting an undergrad engineering degree.  SJSU is well positioned in Silicon Valley with lots of opportunities, not just high tech but also exciting startups that need chemical engineering skills.  Glad their engineering departments forge ties with industry to best prepare their graduates!",

We were very impressed with the level of organization and detail that were provided on the email sent one week prior. We had been surprised to realize that the orientation included a one night stay at the dorms for all students, even if your student was not going to be staying at the dorms during the school year. The food was good and plentiful. The activities during the day were well organized and it was a good experience overall. It was also possible for parents to attend orientation as well for an additional cost. I did not do that so I cannot offer an opinion. We also had to request some special accommodations due to a medical condition and the staff was very empathetic and kind. They were also flexible and made My daughters experience an excellent one during the orientation. Go Spartans!",

During convocation, I received a excellence in leadership award which I am still proud of today. \\n\\nAfter SJSU, I went into a graduate program at another school and I found that SJSU provided a very solid learning foundation for me to succeed. I&apos;m forever grateful for my time here.

But she didn&apos;t and\\njust went ahead and blocked my online payments, so I&apos;d be forced to go to the office and pay in person AND she&apos;d contact the study abroad office to tell them I didn&apos;t pay and that I can&apos;t attend the program... \\n\\nI called back, no answer, so I left a voicemail saying I paid for it, I had the transaction listed on my bank account, so I know you took the money, so why are you calling me?  She called me back, and we spoke, she made excuses about how I &quot;selected the wrong term&quot; when paying, when I KNOW I chose the right one because I triple checked with the professors in charge of the FLP Study Abroad program and they checked with the study abroad office, who told them to choose the term the study abroad program will be. In this case, it was Summer 2019, so that&apos;s what I chose. Yet they couldn&apos;t keep track of it? Whatever she &apos;fixed it&apos; and I&apos;m just glad I didn&apos;t have to pay all over again. \\n\\nBUT the annoyance continues. They CHARGED $35 FOR RETURNED E-CHECKS. As if the school isn&apos;t already sponging me of almost $4,000 a SEMESTER. The fine had no due date, so I was planning on doing it later in the semester, yet Amanda calls me again, says I didn&apos;t pay, THEN PLACES A HOLD ON MY ACCOUNT.  They literally waited until the 2nd week of the semester to place a hold on my account, when it&apos;s peak time for people to be adding and dropping classes....F*** this, honestly, the whole system sucks. I also don&apos;t appreciate being harassed over a $35 fine that had no due date. Be better, thanks.\\n\\nMy older sister went here a few years before me. A few weeks before graduation, they said they didn&apos;t have any record of her so we wouldn&apos;t be able to graduate. She ran around all the offices like crazy trying to figure out what was going on. No one knew, so they&apos;d point her to a different office. Come to find out, they were looking at the wrong list.

Furthermore, the classes all have a policy that enables instructors to chastise students for looking away, not making it to a class quiz that was scheduled to overlap another class you have, giving extra points to student who report other students and the list goes on. What is worse is that the advisors will more than likely deny any credit transfers because they want you to graduate from their university specifically (attempted and this was what was said and the result). They take no consideration for students and for a &quot;university&quot; with instructor that have degrees and is regarded as a &quot;good business school&quot;. It is poorly managed and upper and lower staff frequently makes irrational decisions that are non negotiable. Do not make a mistake in believing that this is a college pick based on old reviews or assumptions. They have changed policies, culture, and there are better options at the time of this writing.",

I received my Bachelor&apos;s degree in Ohio, and I feel that SJSU did a better job at getting their students involved in activities outside of class and held many events. I really enjoyed the &quot;outdoor adventures&quot; where I met a few friends I am still friends with and I also enjoyed the &quot;chew&quot;, which is a cooking class. Between these two activities, I learned how to kayak, surf, and cook many diverse and delicious dishes. I highly recommend participating in these fantastic activities for students!",

Although a public University, I&apos;m sure it must still be very expensive to study here as I figured. However, close proximity to Silicon valley means lots of jobs, which ensures student placement. Overall, should be a great school to go if you&apos;re looking to major in Computer Science or related disciplines! Go SJSU Spartans!",

            "description": "Let me start by saying, what an experience I had at this university. I graduated community in Spring 2015 and then graduated here in Fall 2018.  Throughout my time here I fell in love with the staff and the school. Originally back in high school I did not want to &quot;play it safe&quot; and attend here. What a fool I was! I wish I applied earlier to save me the heart ache and headaches of not being able to attend school in SoCal and problems I faced at EVC. I was accepted into EOP, Educational Opportunities Program, a wonderful program that helped me through my time at SJSU. \\n Although heavily impacted, I loved my time in the psychology department. The professors all have experience in the field and really impart their wisdom. I felt like I realistically could go to any of them for advice, which is incredible because I am very shy. I also feel prepared for attempting to apply to grad school thanks to my professors. \\nThe university itself is quite inspiring. There is so much rich history, and architecture here. I always loved exploring the campus grounds because of how beautiful it is. Also because it has loads of Poke Stops!!! One of my favorite things here is sitting under the trees listening to the bell ring at Tower Hall. \\nAlthough this school is amazing in its resources, I have to knock one star off. The reason for this is due to student safety. Although there are various &quot;blue lights&quot; (campus police system) the campus is still unsafe. There are always robberies at various times in the day (primarily in the garages). There has been gun scares, suicides in the library, and recent racial incidents. Also, there are homeless that wander the grounds, especially the library. Yes they send a bulletin about these incidents to students, but it doesn&apos;t help stop this from happening. \\nAll in all I would recommend this school to incoming freshmen and transfer students. You will receive an excellent education here, but make sure you put in the effort. My grades from EVC (also paper screw ups) haunted me here. Instead of graduating Magna Cum Laude I graduated Cum Laude with Honors in the Major. I worked my ass off and was off only by a little bit. Grades matter, so take your time here seriously. Also keep in mind your experience here is what you make of it. There are loads of clubs, frat/sor, and organizations. I joined Psi Chi, and it was a great decision. The chapter here at SJSU is great. I made friends from my psych classes and we powered through together. Advice: only take on the work load you can realistically handle. Enjoy your time here, because like me you will miss it!  Also look into SJSU Cares! They have wonderful resources for students such as the Mobile Pantry. As a struggling college student they were a life saver to help feed my family, and provide me assistance during the most difficult time in my life. I am forever thankful to them.\\n\\nSo join the Spartan Familia and Spartan Up!",

            "description": "Our child just finished 5th grade at Stratford on San Anselmo, after being there since Pre-K and thru Spring 2022. We used to recommend Stratford to everyone, but now, cannot recommend the school, especially for 5th grade.  Stratford has a serious teacher-accountability issue and is woefully behind the times with their online portal, compared to any other private school in the area. Once we started having issues, I asked the latest principal &quot;why should our child go to Stratford instead of a public school?&quot;. His answer was &quot;we have a 15-1 student/teacher ratio, so no child should get left behind or feel like they are not getting individual attention, like they might-- in public school-- with larger class sizes.&quot; \\n\\nIf you know your child to be outgoing, requires no supervision, is unafraid to ask questions, always motivated to study, and confident in speaking up in class, your kid could thrive anywhere. They are the 5-star reviewers here. They should be reviewing their kid. Many kids at this campus were that way before the pandemic. Stratford literally had no policy regarding getting kids re-acclimated after distance learning.  Coming back to school was sink-or-swim. A group of 5-6 parents and I shared our bad experiences and encouraged each other to talk to the teachers first and then, the principal. It was the worst customer experience of my life, not only because of the money involved, but the &quot;time&quot;..... I write a lot of positive reviews, but if you read any of my negative ones, please know this is the hardest and worst of all of them. My motto is &quot;the fish stinks from the head down...&quot;. \\n\\nStratford is the only private school here, owned by a Private Equity Group from another country that is currently undergoing a severe debt and financial crisis with capital flight, political upheaval, you name it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Education_Group. PEGs, in general, are not known for keeping customers first, they support shareholders. They are known for ruining many an industry. \\n\\nWe were warned about 5th grade at this location by a few parents who each had a few kids go there, and pulled the youngest out in time for 5th. Especially warned of a male math teacher, who had a reputation for being--not mean, but--too gruff and inflexible with any student--especially boys, who were not super motivated, outgoing and studious. He had a way of calling kids out who asked a question about what he just lectured on, blaming them for &quot;not paying attention&quot; or &quot;not taking notes&quot;. Any student who was shy or needed extra help would not get help unless they asked. Kids who needed help, after the way he treated them, &quot;learned how to not ask dumb questions&quot; as my son put it. We asked him many times to please help our shy kid, but he just ghosted us. He somehow chose 2022 summer to quit. His 5th grade co-teacher, a woman who is still there, was kinder the kids, however, she was very disorganized. She changed the lesson plans from what was on the Schoology online schedule almost daily. Constant feedback accomplished nothing. Her habit of &quot;changing of plans on the fly&quot; caused 15 kids,+ 30 parents (45 people), hours of stress almost each night because we would email or text each other to try to figure out what the lesson was (she took to long to respond). Same thing on the weekend for big projects that were due, then not due, because she cancelled at the last minute. \\n\\nMost of us were shocked when we had the first parent teacher conference, which was months into the school year. At that time, they announced to us that not only were our kids struggling, but the two teachers knew about it all those months. None of us were notified by a concerned teacher before that announcement, or any time after that conference. They could see the child needed help and never reached out. We asked why. They said they were waiting for the kids to ask them for help. So much for good student/teacher ratios where the child gets individual attention.\\n\\nThe new principal, who came during lockdown, was a breath of fresh air. The previous principal had years of feedback about 5th grade. Never got better. He tried and tried. Eventually, he quit this summer after 1.5 years at this campus and years at Stratford. Their loss. \\n\\nMost parents I talked to, who had kids who did not do well in math in 5th, said their kids did well in all the previous years. The math was not that much harder, I know, I helped my kid study...Same student, different teachers, seems obvious to me. Instead of giving feedback to the school, they opted to send their kids to expensive and time-consuming tutors. If I bought a car, I would expect the dealer to fix it under warranty, not for me to have to pay out of pocket. Makes no sense to me. \\n\\nSince this has happened, our child applied at 2 local secular private schools. Both have online portals that make Stratford look like the 80s. Better customer support, as well. Your money is spent better elsewhere.",

She is currently enrolled in Ms. Naila and Ms. Shumin&apos;s Pre-K class. Both the teachers are exceptionally well with the kids. Teachers engage the kids in activities right from the time you drop off till the time you pick them up. I have seen teachers read stories or sit with the kids n engage them in conversations while I pick my daughter up. They make learning fun for our daughter. I have seen a tremendous growth in our daughters social n writing skills. She is more confident n Independent. Thanks to the teachers working with her closely on these areas. Our daughter wants to be the last one to be picked up. This shows how much she loves being in the class. \\n\\nWe like the curriculum offered at Stratford. Our daughter enjoys Mr. Max&apos;s music class and recites all the songs at home. I am amazed with her Spanish vocabulary, thanks to Ms. Victoria and she can&apos;t stop talking about all the cool science experiments she learned from Ms. Sandy. \\n\\nWe are looking forward for yet another amazing year at Stratford.",

The school went to distance learning when the pandemic first struck, and it only took them a few weeks to transitioned. PreK we did entirely online. Ms Ankita was amazing and the curriculum was on par with brick-&amp;-mortar. My son read at 4 years old and did basic addition and subtraction.  He is currently back in class in Kindergarten with Mrs Cumbo and Mrs Nair, who are the most patient teachers.  This year has seen amazing growth from my Kinder, writing sentences, reading whole books, proficient with arithmetic and graphs.\\n\\nWhat I love most beyond the academic is the nurturing and warmth of this schools.

            "description": "Both of our kids have attended preschool at stratford, one as they was transitioning out of the home daycare and the other as an addition to the home daycare environment just prior to and during the pandemic. We truly came to Stratford because of Miss Saadiya. We met her for a tour and she was so warm and welcoming. While walking us around campus for the tour she literally knew every child&apos;s name and the kids would light up when she greeted them. We were floored as this was so different than some other schools. Both our kids immediately clicked with her. Aside from all the fun things at Stratford like the train, the music, the science, I think it was the relational aspect that made us feel so comfortable. Our kids were 2 of 7 kids at their home daycare, so making a transition to a bigger preschool was a concern; however, seeing an admissions director know every single child&apos;s name and have a connection with them put us at such ease. She would also check on the kids in their first months, and we would know because the kids would tell us Miss Saadiya visited today! \\n\\nOur child&apos;s preschool teachers have been wonderful this year. Mrs Amisha and Mrs Mamata are so incredibly loving and kind. They give each parent a quick update during pick ups. And they truly love these kids. Our child loves the hugs they get from them and they talk about them both nonstop. If you are in their classroom you are so lucky as at this age and all the things these kids have been through, getting love and care is so important! Even during snack time where teachers may just use the time to do other things or check out, they are multitasking and interacting with the kids, talking about how juicy and crunchy the apples are and bringing in the 5 senses. We also witnessed something after their spring program where like 6 kids were having a meltdown seeing their parents leave. They remained so incredibly calm and were gently calming each child. This is not an easy task with 23 toddlers to manage. They also know your child, their interests, their quirks and they work with your child. Most importantly our child feels loved at school and our child has the space to develop their voice. Miss Angela, the school principal, is both professional and kind. In the first months of school she would stand close to the departure area and would always be connecting with different parents. \\n\\nOur other child is in KG at Stratford and is also very happy!! They still get excited when they see Miss Saadiya around campus and we remember those first apprehensive days of preschool where she would just go sit beside them to increase their comfort. We just have less interaction due to the COVID protocols; however, our child enjoys being with Mrs Cumbo and Mrs Nair. Mr, Bickel is very relatable to the kids and he has a strong presence at the school during morning drive line. It&apos;s not often that you see a principal in this role opening car doors and taking temperatures. As a parent, the academics seem demanding as the kids enter elementary school and that is still something that we are evaluating to see if it is the best fit for our kids; however, our child absolutely loves PE with Coach Collins, music with Miss Dena, and Spanish with Seniora Lopez! These are fan favorites! Our child does not love the daily homework and yet that comes with the territory of the school and we will see how that continues into 1st grade. Are there areas for improvement, sure, as there will be with any school. We encountered a few things that we thought could have been handled differently and yet that would probably be the case anywhere these days. Bottom line is both the kids are happy and I don&apos;t think they have ever said they didn&apos;t want to go to school. Our older child went through so many transitions with COVID and childcare that this year has provided them with a lot of stability and consistency. Also the office staff, specifically Miss Vanessa. She is so wonderful and handles so many things with grace.",

            "description": "We are in our third year at Stratford and I continue to be impressed by all the staff and teachers, and thankful that my son is able to attend this school.  He is currently in Kindergarten and previously attended both Pre-K and T-K.\\n\\nStratford San Jose puts in a lot of effort into making each child feel known, safe, and welcomed.  I have been on campus many times and witnessed interaction between faculty and children in many settings, and without fail the staff and teachers are warm, respectful, and appropriately firm with the children.  Each student is known by name and encouraged to express themselves, while still operating within a structure that teaches core values such as trustworthiness and perseverance.\\n\\nStratford has a very well-rounded curriculum, emphasizing solid foundational skills (reading, writing, math) and also incorporating music, PE, Spanish, art, science, history, and social studies into each week&apos;s lessons. Older students also participate in additional subjects such as computer science.  They also have fun activities (in-person, in normal years) such as pep-rallies, field trips, and after-school clubs.\\n\\nDue to Covid during the 2020-21 school year, Statford has been nimble in adjusting their offerings to suit both online or an in-person hybrid school model.   They have quickly adapted to provide a robust curriculum in both formats and used technology to make sure the online option is still providing a great experience for the kids.\\n\\nI would encourage any parent looking for a school with strong academics, while also truly caring about their child as an individual, to check into Stratford San Jose.",

We have been very impressed with the curriculum as well as the way the teachers have been able to adapt and deliver it virtually. \\n\\nOur teacher, Ms. Ankita has been truly exceptional. It is no small feat to engage kids via zoom. I give all the credit to her for my son thriving academically in remote learning. She is a total rockstar. Her positive vibes uplift the kids and they look forward to the class everyday. She is encouraging and teaches kids to be independent. She is consistent with the behaviors kids are expected to do and she patiently encourages them to make the right choices. You can tell she loves all the kids and the kids adore her!\\n\\nOur son also enjoys art and science. Ms Sandy makes science class interesting and interactive. I marvel at how simply she explains concepts. \\n\\nSpecial shout out to Ms Angela who has been superb too. She has been very responsive and was especially helpful as we transferred our child from De Anza. She really helped us build confidence in her teachers and school. \\n\\nWe couldn&apos;t have made a better choice.",

Within 2 months with Ms. Joly&apos;s class, we can notice her impressive progress. From being scared of snack time and unsocialized, she has become more open with her peers and been able to try new food. Ms. Joly and Stratford was really accommodating to the student&apos;s need and trying to make the children feel at most comfortable. Ms. Joly was very responsive to parents, always let us know how my daughter was doing and if there&apos;s any concern. We really appreciate her for everything she has done for my child and how amazing she was as our teacher.",

Even in those short 2 months he learnt a lot about different life skills, co-existence with Nature and STEAM subjects. Butterfly lifecycle was one of the best projects in my opinion. Students used their imagination to create each form of the lifecycle. Ms Jyoti even demonstrated it using a real caterpillar and its stages. When they let the butterfly into the open air kids&apos; joy had no bounds. This taught them value of freedom for animals and insects as well. She is a very loving and caring teacher, and puts her passion for early childhood education into the curriculum. I saw a big leap in my kid&apos;s painting, writing, expression of his thoughts and creativity during those two months. Big thanks to Ms Michelle who is very kind and loving, taught music, arts and painting to kids that help develop their creative side of brain. My kid had eczema flareups and both teachers took lot of effort to keep it under control by applying home provided eczema cream regularly. On his last day at school they had a nice farewell party and all wished him well. Ms Jyothi&apos;s loving and encouraging words in her short prose for him on his picture will always be cherished :)\\nI am thankful to Stratford San Jose administrative staff for providing excellent support during the toughest times in pandemic. All my concerns and questions about operation in pandemic were very patiently handled. They maintain highest standards of cleanliness and hygiene which made us feel safe and comfortable sending our kid during pandemic. Big shout out to Ms Angela, Ms Saadiya and Jessica. I highly recommend this school and in particular Ms Jyoti&apos;s classroom. Stratford SJ family will always be missed.",

Just be aware that before your child goes to preschoolers. They need to know how to drink and eat on their own. Also, there&apos;s wont be any straws at school to assist them with their drinking. I understand They are strict, but Japanese are known in their country to well disciples. Anyways, My husband is Japanese and He&apos;s very happy with how much his daughter is learning.

The actual &quot;library&quot; is very small area of the second floor, marking one side of the second floor of the building. There aren&apos;t a ton of books, I think there is ONE private study room (on a first-come, first-served basis), and it&apos;s very sad compared to South&apos;s library: several floors of MANY books, a lot of computers, MANY private study rooms for groups as well as cubicle areas, and it&apos;s understood and enforced to be respectful and quiet there. \\n\\nAs a nursing student, it was a bit disappointing there is no formal library or separate building for the School of Nursing. I love the university, but it would be great to see them do more for the academic settings and rein it back a little on the social ones. The social aspects of the university are great, and while nursing students have privileges to be in certain parts of campus for studying regardless of time of day or semester schedule, I think more students could benefit from a formal library-- away from the relaxed environment of loud socializing-- and private study areas within the library. As far as a building for the SoN, only time will tell how/if the funds could provide that...",

But the University of Mobile (UM) is a world-class school and has achieved remarkable status in a relatively few number of &quot;university years.&quot;\\nMy son has attended the University and has benefitted in so many ways.  He is a music and business major and has received top-of-the-line training in both areas.  As an &quot;All-Steinway&quot; school, UM&apos;s dedication to having an ultra high quality music program is apparent.  Christian music legend Dr. Roger Breland is engaged and accessible to the students.\\nThe campus is first-class, and the students are friendly.  My son has made a multitude of great friends. We have attended many different programs there from recitals to the annual &quot;Christmas Spectacular&quot;.  If Branson, Missouri closed down, the faculty and students at UM have more than enough talent to do anything they do in Branson or Nashville.  Their new recording studio, 880 is one of the very best in the country.\\nDr. Smith, the new president of the University seems focused on taking things to the next level and beyond.  He certainly has the credentials and skills, and I believe you will be hearing more and more about this amazing school in the years to come.",

            "description": "From first grade to fith, I attended Robertsdale El-Hi. My adoptive parents went here bacj in the 30&apos;s for goodness sake! And it&apos;s still there!\\nMy memory us of getting into trouble and having to stand outside in the dark hallway..(the school had wood floors then) and freaking out upon hearing shoes clomping from the distance, fearing it was Virgil Buck, the principal at the time, coming toward me. He actually found me once and was very kind to me. Of course, I had his wife as a teacher in 2nd grade and she kept me in a &apos;special&apos; desk close to hers so she could keep an eye on me. I actually thrived that year.\\nThe place was so old they still had cloak rooms. I was put in there a lot by teachers. The whole place was OLD! I&apos;m quite surprised I didn&apos;t find graffiti from my mom and dad&apos;s time!\\nBut I loved the grassy hill outside that sprouted onion grass every spring and the old oaks and pecan trees. One of the old trees is still there but a shadow of its former might.\\nSo glad certain landmarks are still around.",

In the spring, the bounty of Azaleas all over the county sprinkle the landscape with vibrant colors.  \\n\\nSummer/Fall temperatures can sometimes extend into November, so there is not a huge display of fall colors.  Plus, there are more evergreen trees than there are trees whose leaves change color.  \\n\\nPublic transportation is really bad, so a car is absolutely necessary to get around.  \\n\\nThere are a number of institutions of higher education.  Bishop State Community College has 3 campuses that offer different technical specialties.  \\n\\nMobile College has become the University of Mobile.  It is a private Baptist -affiliated institution.   \\n\\nSpring Hill College is another private institution that is affiliated with Roman Catholics, while the University of South Alabama is a public, mostly teaching institution with a phenomenal Medical school, public hospital and level 1 trauma center.  \\n\\nThe State-of-the-Art Convention Center is on the waterfront and hosts all sorts of conferences.  The building was erected around the train tracks such a train goes through the building on a daily schedule.   \\n\\nThe historic (1927) Seanger Theatre in an historic section of downtown Mobile offers numerous live performances and even has a summer movie series.  \\n\\nMobile Bay Bears (minor league baseball) are a double A affiliate of the Anaheim Angels and the play their home games at Hank Aaron Stadium.  Hank Aaron, who broke Babe Ruth&apos;s  career home run record is from Mobile.  Other teams in existence are (were) the Mobile Bay Tarpons (indoor football), the Mobile Mysticks  (hockey:1995-2002), Mobile Revelers (basketball:2001-2001).  \\n\\nDowntown Mobile also has the Alabama State Docks (Port of Mobile), which is in the top 12 largest shipping Ports (by tonnage) in the Nation. It is the only deep-water port in the state.  \\n\\nWhile this is not all of the glorious offerings of Mobile, Al, you can see that it has many components of a nice place to visit or live.",

The school is nice, the eduacation is good, most of the teachers are very help, etc. The only thing I would have to complain about is how focused it is on sports. Mostly football but sports in general. So much time and focus goes in the sports that the arts are rarely given the support that it needs. I understand how good sports are for students but the arts are just as important for a student to be able to grow. Although the Arts are not as loved as they should be Saraland offers many arts to participate in and that I am extremely grateful for. The only thing I and any of the parents and students are asking for is more support and focus.",

            "description": "Let me start off by saying that I feel like I&apos;m the kinda person who lingers between Andy Dwyer and Ron Swanson. So before you take this too seriously, let me remind you that this is a Yelp review. That being said, I&apos;d love to come out of retirement for this review and talk about something that I&apos;ve cared so deeply about ever since I joined Greek Life, in the time before twitter. Lame ik.. \\n\\nFirst, I highly recommend going Greek no matter what your age is. But before you do, know that there is a standard you must meet. The school will tell you that you need a minimum GPA of 2.5 in college or in High School (if you&apos;re an incoming freshman). But lets be real, if you&apos;re coming out of HS with a GPA between a 2.5 &amp; 2.8 you need to seriously consider establishing a solid GPA for a semester or two before you join. Now for the part they won&apos;t talk about during recruitment.. You need to be a person of solid character and moral judgment. In life you&apos;re going to be put in awkward situations that you&apos;re not always going to have a good answer for. But you don&apos;t have to be a rocket scientist to know the difference between good and bad. You&apos;ll learn proper etiquette later and will mold in to the person you were meant to be as you get older. That&apos;s life. \\n\\nNow who doesn&apos;t love sorority rush?? I&apos;ll be quick and to the point. As a whole, sororities at ATU need to use more glitter and the Campus Rush video needs a serious overhaul. The music in the video is comparable to Nickelback playing at a Chuck E Cheese venue. (Cringe) Now I understand the school wants to come off as a safe and conservative place for students. But seriously? Ew. My experience with sororities has been excellent. Something about southern ladies helping the community and being leaders on campus is a thing of beauty. (To my knowledge the Panhellenic Council is a secret society of robe wearers who all carry gavels) Idk I&apos;ve never been to one of their meetings, it&apos;s just what I&apos;ve heard.\\n\\nFor the men in Greek Life, I&apos;ll make this super short and hopefully you&apos;ll get something out of it:\\nYou&apos;re born male, You grow in to a man, and you choose to be a gentleman. You can be cool and interact with everyone on campus without having to act insecure. Do that and you&apos;re college experience will be so much more bearable.\\n \\nNow for the PRO&apos;S: 1 Speaking from experience, Greek Life gives you a platform to meet and get out in front of new people.  2 You&apos;ll make a ton of new friends and make memories that will last a lifetime. Who knew this was possible in Russellville? 3 Opportunities to get involved are endless. You can literally do incredible things to help the community. 4 Mixers!! Need I say more? 5 Greek Week. This is hard to explain unless you&apos;ve been through it.\\n\\nAnd finally: The CON&apos;S : 1 The Link 2 Mandatory meetings and events 3 No Greek housing. Seriously Tech needs to get on this. It&apos;s kind of embarrassing and hard to justify all of the improvements on campus while not have Greek housing. 4 Student Services can be your best friend or worst nightmare. Elect intelligent and hard working leaders!! 5 Fines 6 Living in Russellville. \\n\\nI could go on all day. Seriously. (Willing to change my review to 5 stars pending I get my photo hung up and placed in Doc Bryan). @RiffRaffPayne",

Otherwise, the teachers will lie about you and your grades and you will FAIL! Their activities are overpriced, their sites don&apos;t work so you have a maximum of a 5% chance of getting into your desired sport! They force you to take place in meaningless assemblies that last FIVE SECONDS, and the students absolutely suck when you&apos;re disabled like me. You have little to no friends. When you go into an IEP meeting for special needs like me, they set wondrous goals, and never get close to helping you complete them at all! The only students who get to go on field trips are students in choir and other musical activities, but this applies to the previously mentioned little to no chance of being able to join said activity! If you&apos;re seen with a seemingly dangerous item coming on campus, they take it away and never give it back. A PAIR OF GLOVES IS NOT A WEAPON! This school sucks overall. If you want to go to cal poly, OSU, or whatever, go to a better high school. *Atascadero high school in california* if you go to this school, good luck trying not to drop out.",

One of the latter is the winter snow ecology course held on Mt. Ashland involving a trek on snow shoes, building a snow cave and looking for the tunnels of voles and other winter-active rodents.. Another fun &quot;class&quot; was the sunset photo hike to the summit of Mr. Elijah starting with a walk through wild flowers and pitcher plants and the drive partly up the mountain then a walk through forest, meadow, past an alpine lake and ending with a magnificent view of the Siskiyou Mountains.  Did we see the ocean on the far horizon? Some said yes, some said no.\\n\\nSeveral classes are family oriented and there are also special ones for school groups and for teachers.\\n\\nFor those who need accommodations at Sema, there are yerts and a camping area, or a few miles away, some motels.",

There are lots of other &quot;wildlife&quot; attractions that seem very &quot;Tiger King&quot; esque. Not this place! These animals are all rescued and seem well taken care of. This is a perfect stop for all ages. It was one of the highlights of our trip!",

Everyone is kind and friendly and they even work with the Irwin family, which is amazing! A must see. They could really use your business to help feed the animals and continue their work.",

My wife and I really enjoyed the experience. \\n\\nThe mountain lion came right up to the fence and was less than two feet away.  I could hear it breathing and saw his breath in the cold morning air. You are very close to the birds of prey also.  The bald eagle looked huge.  It was quite an experience for my wife and me.  \\n\\nIt is a little out of the way but worth it.  We were there mid January and they already had 10 new birds/animals they received for the year.  Some of them can be rehabilitated and released back into the wild.  Others must remain at the Center. Your visit will help them continue their great work.",

We&apos;ve routinely saved these items since they asked for these items a number of years ago. We called ahead to verify the need and were told to bring them over, we said we would and because of Covid, would drop the donation out of the way on the front porch.\\nWe pulled up, and started to unload and &quot;Cheryl&quot; came out and unpleasantly asked us what we thought we were doing. We explained, and said we had called. Then she wanted us to carry them inside. We were masked up, but declined. She became agitated, and rudely told us to just take them home--&quot;we don&apos;t want it and we don&apos;t need it&quot;. We left the items, and reminded her that we were members, she shouted &quot;WELL THANKS FOR NOTHING&quot; as we walked back to our truck and departed.\\nPrior to yesterday we have never had a bad experience at Wildlife images. We&apos;ve routinely taken out of town visitors there, and all have loved their visits. Our visit yesterday left a bad taste, and all because &quot;Cheryl&quot; was nothing but mean and nasty to us when we were trying to help and had even called ahead to verify the items were needed.",

A 90% volunteer staff keeps the facility functioning.\\n\\nUsing a variety of fund raising methods, the guided tour is the most interactive, at a cost of about 10$ per person - this tour takes you as a group, on about an hour and a half leisurely walk or ride (electric carts available for a fee for those with mobility issues) through the park grounds. Where you will have up close and personal interaction with a variety of the facilities permanent residents. \\n\\nSeveral raptors and birds of prey, Gray wolves, bears, cougars, badgers, otters and bobcats are a part of the family here - several have been here for a decade or better. Most of these animals are domesticated, or habitualized  are unable to adapt back into the wild. \\n\\nThe day of our visit, our tour had about 15-20 in our group and it was a hot summer afternoon so most of the animals were either sleeping or lazing around.\\n\\nWe did have great encounters with the cougar and the grizzle bears - they were right up on the fence in both cases and interacted with the guide and as such the group was a part of the action.\\n\\nThere is a gift shop as well as a membership information desk in the main building, and all funds raised go to help maintain the facility and the animals. So far to date for the year 2015, Wildlife Images had released 206 injured or orphaned animal back into the wild.\\n\\nA worthwhile organization and well worth the drive out to Merlin.\\n\\nA solid 4 Stars \\n\\n00266",

We saw many different birds hawks, vultures, owls and even a couple bald eagles.  My favorite animal was Clark the Cougar who was gotten as a pet and the owners had his tendons cut when he got big so now he can barely walk.  It was so sad.  He seemed very sweet purring and rubbing against the fence.  We also saw several bears, a couple wolves, a honey badger and many other animals.  Some I had never heard of.  They rehabilitate and release back into the wild the animals they can and those that are unable to be released either because of permanent injury or human imprintation can live at the facility permanently.  Our guide Eric did a great job of teaching us about each animal and how they came to be at the center.  He taught us about the effects of hunting, exotic pet ownership and wildlife legislation in an informative and factual way that didn&apos;t offend anyone on either side of the issue.  The facility itself is very nice.  There were several areas that they were building or upgrading.  Make a donation or buy something from the gift shop to show support.  My nephew goes to their summer day camp for kids and loves it.",

            "description": "An amazing facility-- it was an incredibly heart warming and inspirational experience.  Our tour guide who had only been working for Wildlife Images for a month and a half knew every animal and shared their story with us.  The critters and creatures brought here have been taken in from all over and have been assisted with their rehabilitation (sadly, most of the injuries were at the hands of people).  Wildlife gives a home to an impressive array of cougars, black bears, grizzly bears, birds of prey, and one seriously feisty badger, &quot;Nubs&quot;.  \\n\\nThe animals are quite social and were interested in seeing visitors.  It&apos;s nice to see animals that live in spaces where trees are actually growing and their keepers are concerned for creating as &apos;normal&apos; of an environment for them as possible.  The tour guide mentioned a few times that they work with other centers to help the social animals find mates to keep them company...even if that means sending them out.\\n\\nThe gift store itself is clean, well put together, and if you look for the picture of the grizzly bear sitting with a cat, you will find a story that will move you to TEARS.  If not tears, maybe your eyes will well up.  At any rate, this is a place you should absolutely visit, and genuinely feel great about supporting.",

Everything was clean and our tour guide seemed knowledgeable about the animals and facility. My husband myself and our two kids ended up with a pretty large group during our tour. There were really too many people to all go through the tour at the same time and get to appreciate what is there. There was another group with our tour and the older guy was making animal calls at all the animals while our guide was speaking preventing us from being able to hear what she was saying. After a little while the two kids with him began doing the same thing. It was very disruptive and frustrating as the tour guide said nothing to quiet them down.",

If you are looking for something to do and or want to know more about all living creatures this is the place to go. Everybody is so very friendly and very very reasonable priced. Awesome gift store that is also reasonable priced. If you love and care about animals, you need to go and visit.  They&apos;re wonderfully loving to the animals. They do awesome work to help rehabilitate animals and return them to the wild. Those that are not able to survive in the wild will have a home there. The animals there in the facility are happy, healthy, well cared for and loved. \\nI HIGHLY recommend going &amp; touring. There are Wolves, Cougars, Black Bears, Grizzles, Bobcats, Raccoons, Owls big &amp; small, Eagles, Hawks, Vultures a lot of types of birds, so many others I can&apos;t name them all. You&apos;ll meet Nestle who stared in a movie, you&apos;ll meet Nubs who will walk on a leash and harness. You&apos;ll also meet Scratch and Sniff two sibling who love to play with each other, you&apos;ll meet Baby who loves to play and is not a raccoon. \\nPLEASE GO HAVE FUN!!!!!

It was a very small group so everyone was able to ask questions they had. You are able to get right up close to the animals, it is so amazing to be that close to Cougar and Bears. It was feeding time when we were there so it was interesting to watch them being fed. It was also frightening watching them stalk the girls as they would bring their food out. Wild Animals are amazing creatures. It is not often you get to observe them so closely. \\nI love what they do at this facility. It must be such a satisfying job saving and helping these injured animals that would otherwise not be here. \\nI wish some of the fencing was easier to see through. It is hard to take pictures of a lot of the animals because of hard to see through fencing. I realize why it is there, for our protection of course but there must be an easier way to provide safety for us and the animals and observation ease. \\nGreat Job Wildlife Images!",

The volunteer docents vary in knowledge and personality; one old man needlessly insulted some members of our party.\\n\\nPerhaps the saddest exhibit is the albino ground squirrel that incessantly runs around its small cage. The animal is obviously insane but its frantic antics provide amusement to visitors. \\n\\nA close up, unobstructed view is provided to some bald eagles and a sad-looking turkey vulture. You can also walk close to the wire fences to observe the bears, wolves and other predators.\\n\\nFor a couple of hundred dollars the staff will bring some animals to a school, organization or group and give a presentation. Special tours can be arranged, though I didn&apos;t have much luck getting one since the staff never got back to me about available dates.\\n\\nMany sick, injured or orphaned baby animals are treated and, if they can survive on their own, released. However, taking an overall, less emotional approach, your money might be more effectively spent donating to a major conservation organization that will save endangered species and tens of thousands of other animals.\\n\\nThat being said, Wildlife images is a good place to bring youngsters to show them what the local wildlife looks like.",

They both have very different personalities and learning skills that were both nurtured and loved thanks to Little Hands. Both my kids went there together for the past year. (Which having brother and sister together creates its own challenges.) It was amazing to watch the two of them grow and learn. They are both much better at sharing toys and feelings between themselves and with others. I am so proud of them and so thankful for my decision to send them to Little Hands Montessori Preschool. My children now teach me sign language and yoga that they learned at school and they practice almost everyday. My daughter is now especially concerned about her health and making healthy choices everyday. She only wants to eat healthy foods. She&apos;s not even 5 years old yet. I have Preschool to thank for that interest. She&apos;s keeping the whole family in check. Not only was it great for my children but it was an excellent choice that benefited our whole family. I am sad to say they don&apos;t attend there any longer only because we moved away. If you have the opportunity to send your kids here, I would recommend it.",

            "description": "Rogue Community College is a waste of time and money. All the teachers are old and outdated in their fields. They write some of their own textbooks and don&apos;t even bother to bind them, but continue to charge you insane prices. The worst part is definitely the instructors though. I had a math class where the teacher instructed the class to &quot;not ask any questions in class&quot;. The teachers put off actual teaching to volunteers at the tutoring center who may or may not know much about that particular subject. The &quot;lab&quot; class for the science courses are taught by whichever staff member is available whether they know anything about science or not. The person who taught my lab class was not able to answer any question and many students called that class a &quot;DIY class&quot; because there was no instruction going on. I would not recommend this college to anyone who wants a real education. They will take money from you any way that they can without giving you anything in return.",

The school is nice, the eduacation is good, most of the teachers are very help, etc. The only thing I would have to complain about is how focused it is on sports. Mostly football but sports in general. So much time and focus goes in the sports that the arts are rarely given the support that it needs. I understand how good sports are for students but the arts are just as important for a student to be able to grow. Although the Arts are not as loved as they should be Saraland offers many arts to participate in and that I am extremely grateful for. The only thing I and any of the parents and students are asking for is more support and focus.",

One even stated that misgendering a trans person on purpose is not only okay but expected. When I had a panic attack the music teacher ignored me even though I stated multiple times I needed space. Been accused of skipping when I was in a therapy session, the counselors have told the class I&apos;ve had a mental breakdown, etc. when the former art teacher was fired for texting inappropriate things to a student the school claimed nothing happened and it was all just a rumor even though there was proof. This school is no where near decent. Almost every staff member either hates kids and immature, and the nice sweet staff are undervalued and underpaid.",

The actual &quot;library&quot; is very small area of the second floor, marking one side of the second floor of the building. There aren&apos;t a ton of books, I think there is ONE private study room (on a first-come, first-served basis), and it&apos;s very sad compared to South&apos;s library: several floors of MANY books, a lot of computers, MANY private study rooms for groups as well as cubicle areas, and it&apos;s understood and enforced to be respectful and quiet there. \\n\\nAs a nursing student, it was a bit disappointing there is no formal library or separate building for the School of Nursing. I love the university, but it would be great to see them do more for the academic settings and rein it back a little on the social ones. The social aspects of the university are great, and while nursing students have privileges to be in certain parts of campus for studying regardless of time of day or semester schedule, I think more students could benefit from a formal library-- away from the relaxed environment of loud socializing-- and private study areas within the library. As far as a building for the SoN, only time will tell how/if the funds could provide that...",

But the University of Mobile (UM) is a world-class school and has achieved remarkable status in a relatively few number of &quot;university years.&quot;\\nMy son has attended the University and has benefitted in so many ways.  He is a music and business major and has received top-of-the-line training in both areas.  As an &quot;All-Steinway&quot; school, UM&apos;s dedication to having an ultra high quality music program is apparent.  Christian music legend Dr. Roger Breland is engaged and accessible to the students.\\nThe campus is first-class, and the students are friendly.  My son has made a multitude of great friends. We have attended many different programs there from recitals to the annual &quot;Christmas Spectacular&quot;.  If Branson, Missouri closed down, the faculty and students at UM have more than enough talent to do anything they do in Branson or Nashville.  Their new recording studio, 880 is one of the very best in the country.\\nDr. Smith, the new president of the University seems focused on taking things to the next level and beyond.  He certainly has the credentials and skills, and I believe you will be hearing more and more about this amazing school in the years to come.",

            "description": "I am happy with the care that my child receives. I like how everyone that works there is happy and clean. I like how the kitchen is separate from the class rooms. It&apos;s more like a actual &quot;school&quot; than a daycare. The kids have a great learning program and I feel like he son is so smart and he is only 2 1/2. The children are carefully looked after and are all loved. The only negative thing I have to say about this place is the nutrition program. They say that their food is nutritious but they feed then powerded sugar donuts for breakfast, coco puffs, and give snacks every day like cr\u00e8me pies, brownies and cookies. I mean sugar every now and then is on but feeding my child any type of sugar before they have teeth and every day is not right to me. We do not eat a lot of sugar but my kid is being fed it daily. I have complained multiple times but all they say is that &quot;we don&apos;t have to give him any but he will be singled out&quot;. And I don&apos;t want him to feel like that, its torture for a kid. I even brought snack subsites like gram crackers for him but they keep forgetting about it. Im a little torn with this place because I love the people, the learning program, facility, and the care he receives. But for the price I pay once a week ($180.00) I feel like the nutrition program needs a makeover. There are other options out there besides donuts.",

And it&apos;s still there!\\nMy memory us of getting into trouble and having to stand outside in the dark hallway..(the school had wood floors then) and freaking out upon hearing shoes clomping from the distance, fearing it was Virgil Buck, the principal at the time, coming toward me. He actually found me once and was very kind to me. Of course, I had his wife as a teacher in 2nd grade and she kept me in a &apos;special&apos; desk close to hers so she could keep an eye on me. I actually thrived that year.\\nThe place was so old they still had cloak rooms. I was put in there a lot by teachers. The whole place was OLD! I&apos;m quite surprised I didn&apos;t find graffiti from my mom and dad&apos;s time!\\nBut I loved the grassy hill outside that sprouted onion grass every spring and the old oaks and pecan trees. One of the old trees is still there but a shadow of its former might.\\nSo glad certain landmarks are still around.",

In the spring, the bounty of Azaleas all over the county sprinkle the landscape with vibrant colors.  \\n\\nSummer/Fall temperatures can sometimes extend into November, so there is not a huge display of fall colors.  Plus, there are more evergreen trees than there are trees whose leaves change color.  \\n\\nPublic transportation is really bad, so a car is absolutely necessary to get around.  \\n\\nThere are a number of institutions of higher education.  Bishop State Community College has 3 campuses that offer different technical specialties.  \\n\\nMobile College has become the University of Mobile.  It is a private Baptist -affiliated institution.   \\n\\nSpring Hill College is another private institution that is affiliated with Roman Catholics, while the University of South Alabama is a public, mostly teaching institution with a phenomenal Medical school, public hospital and level 1 trauma center.  \\n\\nThe State-of-the-Art Convention Center is on the waterfront and hosts all sorts of conferences.  The building was erected around the train tracks such a train goes through the building on a daily schedule.   \\n\\nThe historic (1927) Seanger Theatre in an historic section of downtown Mobile offers numerous live performances and even has a summer movie series.  \\n\\nMobile Bay Bears (minor league baseball) are a double A affiliate of the Anaheim Angels and the play their home games at Hank Aaron Stadium.  Hank Aaron, who broke Babe Ruth&apos;s  career home run record is from Mobile.  Other teams in existence are (were) the Mobile Bay Tarpons (indoor football), the Mobile Mysticks  (hockey:1995-2002), Mobile Revelers (basketball:2001-2001).  \\n\\nDowntown Mobile also has the Alabama State Docks (Port of Mobile), which is in the top 12 largest shipping Ports (by tonnage) in the Nation. It is the only deep-water port in the state.  \\n\\nWhile this is not all of the glorious offerings of Mobile, Al, you can see that it has many components of a nice place to visit or live.",

I would keep her here through college if I could! My very first impression was the incredibly sweet staff. I went in for an interview &amp; was blown away at the organization &amp; cleanliness of the whole school. There were tons of educational activities &amp; &quot;stations&quot;, very bright &amp; colorful posters &amp; materials on the walls, &amp; even class pets! Everything was put in its place &amp; the entire environment was just SO charming I never wanted to leave. My child is the &quot;baby&quot; &amp; has a VERY willful temperament, but the teachers won us over almost instantly &amp; proved to me that my daughter CAN be taught self-control and self-direction. Not only have they helped her develop important social &amp; personal skills, but her learning there is astounding. I just found out this week that she is learning multiplication! At SIX years old! We all love her teacher(s), &amp; I have VERY much enjoyed volunteering as much as I can with her class. The *only* problem I have had is that the tuition is very pricey, which I can&apos;t personally afford after this year. Breaks my heart!",

The school is nice, the eduacation is good, most of the teachers are very help, etc. The only thing I would have to complain about is how focused it is on sports. Mostly football but sports in general. So much time and focus goes in the sports that the arts are rarely given the support that it needs. I understand how good sports are for students but the arts are just as important for a student to be able to grow. Although the Arts are not as loved as they should be Saraland offers many arts to participate in and that I am extremely grateful for. The only thing I and any of the parents and students are asking for is more support and focus.",

The principal and Director of the school was not as concerned as I thought they should be. I really felt like they were trying to discredit my child. My child made an accusation and they did look into it, but when asked to do further research their response was &quot;that would take a long time&quot;. Not the response you should hear when your child is making an accusation. No one ever called to see how she was doing during the process. I finally called them to let them know that we will be removing our child from the program. I am really hurt from this experience because we&apos;ve been with the daycare since 2011. My oldest daughter went here and so did my son. I did not agree with how the situation was handled. I will not recommend this facility.",

We had such a great experience with it that we decided to keep her going to the school   during our time we started getting involved with the school and some church activities.  Kindergarten went well but I was always worried that my child was too young in the class and voiced my concerns only to be assured that she was fine. In kindergarten alone she had two different teachers in one year. Hoping next year would be a good year we decided to give it another chance. \\nwell two months into the year we find out that guess what again a change in teachers.\\nThe teacher coming in had found her favorite kids. During this time my mother passed away and the families in the class offered to bring dinners we were thankful.  This is where I learned my lesson.  The head pastor pulled us a side and gifted to us several gift cards to store knowing we were witnessing hard times. We were grateful.  Thanked him and wrote letters to the person who donated them. \\nA month away from the end of the school year his grandchild told my daughter that her daddy was a far loser because he had no job and another parent started talking smack about our family.  I received a call from hus daughter going off on me about Ho she expected more out of me being a Christian woman and how she could make our lives a living hell and get us kicked out. The when I complain to the principal she assured me that my child would be fine and that she would handle it and that she was leaving. She also told me to make sure to change schools for a better education. Sure enough the last day of school the teacher informed me that my child should be heald behind and also provide work. She told me this was work she with heald back since she didn&apos;t feel that my daughter was not at level.\\n\\nTook us three weeks to get our refund.  We sent a letter to the head pastor informing him of our concerns and we receive a Letter throwing everything they did for us in our face calling us ungrateful.  Stated he was going to read the letter to the church and let everyone read it. \\n\\nI would never recommend this school to anyone who is not their religion.  They are not accepting or welcoming.",

            "description": "As a new mom, there were much guilt that accompanies the role. The biggest of all and a myth IMHO is that a child thrives best with the mother for its first five years. So it was with a lot of trepidation and questions when I toured childcare facilities around me. With so many by me, and upon the recommendation of neighbors who had lived in the area for a while, The Learning Tree has consistently been the lauded choice. \\n\\nThe building was very unassuming, a low-lying ranch nestled between an auto parts place and a furniture store, off a busy street. Inside, while it lacked the fanciness and spaciousness of some facilities, it was clean. It smelled clean (and not in a chemical way), felt clean, looked clean, and continues to be so to this very day. I want my house to be this neat and clean! How do they do it??? \\n\\nI enrolled my child when he was 9 months old, and every day, I continue to marvel at the progress he has made under their care. I honestly can attest that I will not be able to prep him for all the development that he has undergone if he had stayed home with me, or a private caretaker, or an au pair.\\n\\nThe teachers and staff are warm, loving, firm, and highly knowledgeable. I have sought them out for advice on numerous occasions. from discipline to teaching/learning. They even helped potty-trained him before he turned 2! Every teacher knows all the children by name, even those whose classes he had not even attended. As I write this during the COVID shelter in place, I am tearing up at the thought that he would not be back with them as this is his last year there. He should be spending fun summers with them, growing even more robustly. I can only take comfort that when this COVID is over, we are still near enough to drop by to visit. \\n\\nField trips and holiday activities are included in the experience. My son has met Mrs. Claus, the Easter Bunny, fire fighters, librarians. He&apos;s been apple picking, visited maple farms, fire stations, libraries, parks. He&apos;s had &quot;cooking&quot; lessons. \\n\\nWhat was enviable among my other parent friends in other suburbs is that my son got an additional enrichment by learning Spanish, which was an option when he turned 4. Plus, at the end of every school year, we received a folder of his progress. That was also unheard of with my friends&apos; children at their daycare. \\n\\nI cannot recommend The Learning Tree enough. I could go on, but I highly suggest you give them a consideration.",

Dropping them off each morning I know that their days will be filled with adventure, learning, and plenty of love and guidance. The staff has become an extension of our family, asking about events and milestones along the way. Always eager to support our children, in whatever they do. \\nAfter a horrible in-home experience, we transitioned our daughter to Learning Tree when she was about 18 months old. From that moment on, I never had to worry about who was caring for my children. Our son started at Learning Tree at age 10 weeks and has flourished. It has been amazing to watch them build such a strong bond with all of the staff here. Even the teachers outside of our children&apos;s classrooms know them by name and have built strong relationships. \\nThis is a great place that strives to do what&apos;s best for children each day.",

Both classes were presented in an easy to learn hands on training format. I hope to take several more of his classes.  Great job!\\n\\nThe Conceal Carry 1 class on Saturday was a life changing experience. The materials and hands on training were presented in steps, which was very helpful.  Each skill set built on the one learned before it.  \\n\\nI have a much better understanding of what it means to be a permitted concealed carrier, the responsibilities involved and the speed in which a &quot;critical incident&quot; can occur.  I learned you never have as much time as you think you do.\\n\\nHighly recommend Gulf Firearms Instruction for all of your firearms safety training needs.",

Ten hours split between instruction and shooting.  Scott was fantastic in the classroom setting. He was very knowledgeable and kept my attention. Safety was a primary focus from the start. Our class was diverse consisting of both men and women and one child roughly 13 years of age. There are three instructors to help and guide while on the range. All three were personable and knowledgeable. I intend to take the concealed carry class as my schedule permits.",

The school is nice, the eduacation is good, most of the teachers are very help, etc. The only thing I would have to complain about is how focused it is on sports. Mostly football but sports in general. So much time and focus goes in the sports that the arts are rarely given the support that it needs. I understand how good sports are for students but the arts are just as important for a student to be able to grow. Although the Arts are not as loved as they should be Saraland offers many arts to participate in and that I am extremely grateful for. The only thing I and any of the parents and students are asking for is more support and focus.",

Many aspects of digital marketing, and just marketing in general, had never crossed my mind as important or significant. Market Campus has set me up to be able to tackle any digital marketing problem that may arise within my own projects. The curriculum was well paced and the online delivery was easily digestible. My instructors were extremely knowledable and were industry professionals that eat and breathe digital marketing all day long. Overall, I was extremely satisfied with my experience at Market Campus, and would not only recommend it for those looking to get into digital marketing as a career, but also for anyone that needs or wants to learn the latest and greatest techniques in digital marketing for their own projects and businesses.",

            "description": "DO NOT SEND YOUR KID HERE. My son fell on his head 3 days in one week. Last fall was while he was eating in his seat and fell forward with the eating chair. Immediately went to pick up my son and asked for footage of what had happened. Tami did not want to provide the footage, as she &quot;couldn&apos;t leave the desk&quot;. She said we&apos;d Need to make an appointment to view the footage. Which I immediately emailed her so that we can schedule. The only reason I was/ still am frustrated is because how does my son fall 3 times in one week? The last fall was while he was eating and strapped in, seriously!? To which they basically blamed him since he moved to fast. He was about 6-8 months. We go in to look at footage she basically gives us a run around and how the school is great and they really look after their kids- not. Brings in the teacher who let him fall, who did the same as well. The teacher who let him fall explained that she didn&apos;t want this to happen again and was going to watch them more closely... seriously? After about 45 minutes of listening to them do nothing. Tammi pretends to look up the footage and says &quot;oh the cameras are not working, they must be under maintenance&quot;. She knew the cameras did not work, she knew what she was doing. How do you advertise that the kids are always closely monitored via cameras and when my son fell it seems to not work? She then followed with &quot;the floors are not that hard to where they would get hurt&quot;. For anyone who has a kid there, they are definitely not the same floors as other daycares who don&apos;t neglect their kids. As I told tammi, the first time was an accident, second time was &quot;what&apos;s going on&quot; and the third is just neglect. She argued it was not. All I have to say is be glad you guys do not have a lawsuit on your hands. DO NOT SEND YOUR KIDS HERE. YOU WILL ONLY HEAR HORROR STORIES FROM HERE. TAMI IS AWFUL AND RUDE. No real apologies were made and all she asked for was payment, after I had put a stop payment on the tuition. To when I responded that tuition should be the least of her worries, she waived the fee and took the deposit as the fee. SERIOUSLY THIS SCHOOL IS AWFUL. NEGLECT ALL AROUND. I am still so upset about this, I trusted them with my baby because of all the false promises they promised. As I said, they are lucky they don&apos;t have a lawsuit on their hands.",

            "description": "Let me begin by saying that we are grateful for  our son&apos;s time here. The School was always clean and the hours are so flexible. He was there 3 times a week for four years and they were always willing to accommodate us if we were in a pinch and needed an extra day of childcare. We were always met with kindness and the school is a fun and safe atmosphere. \\n\\nHowever, after leaving I learned a few hard truths. The school stresses academics and curriculum and I do not feel as though my son&apos;s educational outcomes reflect this. In fact when being assessed for Kindergarten it was realized that he was far behind and did not get in to the parochial school we had applied to. We then went to another school where one month in we noticed a huge change, and in 6 months he had caught up to the necessary benchmarks. \\n\\nAdditionally, I do have to make a full disclaimer and say that in the spring before we changed schools he was diagnosed as autistic. This can explain the above issue but can also lead to the matter that yes although I am the parent and fully responsible for my child&apos;s well being, as a first time mother I put some reliance on my child&apos;s teachers to indicate to me if something was concerning. One day they had a child psychologist observing another child there and she caught it, in one afternoon. So my only advice to the school may be to consider investing in some training to identify and assist special needs children. \\n\\nOverall I would say we had mostly positive experience but wanted to share my thoughts/ concerns.",

There were two ladies at the front desk one was busy on the phone and the other didn&apos;t acknowledge me and stared at the computer screen. I stood there and said &quot; good morning &quot;! Finally I got acknowledged. The receptionist who was in the phone began talking to me and was friendly.  Then Sara came and gave me a tour of the place . She was amazing ! Sara knows the information and answer my questions. I tour the place and it seem pretty good except the class where the four year olds . The teacher was busy cutting out letters which means her eyes were not on the children . The children were eating and this could have been a great time to learn about the foods they are eating and also interactions take place during meals .  As a teacher myself and parent I was not happy to see that . Also she was not welcoming at all the teacher slightly turn to see me and went back to cutting out letters and numbers she didn&apos;t get up and approach my daughter or me shake hands nothing unprofessional. I hope to tour again with my husband.  Friendliness and attitude can definitely be improved.",

I can&apos;t just waiver on that i have to work and i know when my time is up. Merryhill told me there would be a spot in late April. I paid a deposit because the manager / director told me there was a spot. They even told me how i could bring my daughter by before hand to interact with the teacher and daughter. Only when i called to confirm my start date they told me there was no opening until July. They will not refund my money and didn&apos;t even offer an apology. I asked if they could transfer the deposit to my friend since i have to do something else now and they said no.

There is too many students in the class for what I wanted for my son&apos;s first school experience to be (the student to teacher ratio was near the high limit). What I saw and did not like was teachers on their phones on Facebook while the kids lay awake on their cots ( they could have been patting the kid&apos;s backs and trying to help them get to sleep)...and the teacher helping a child to use the bathroom during snack and not having him wash his hands!

Those staff know who the caretakers are! I know some parents may also have ideas too!\\nI also propose a guideline on kids who are too rough and who hit other kids often. If there are 3 strikes of biting or hurting other kids, please take them out. \\nIt&apos;s basically the same few people going around causing all this grief and trauma.

We get detailed reports with pictures every day and the center does an excellent job making sure parents are always notified about any changes.\\n\\nWhen we drive by my daughter says &quot;Mommy! That&apos;s my school!!!&quot; and she is excited to be there every day. Picking a daycare is a tough decision for parents but I feel like we made the best choice picking Kiddie Academy",

            "description": "This was one of the first daycare locations we toured and we were blown away with how clean the facility was, how nice and informative the director was and how nice the staff and the teachers were. Everyone I worked with was extremely easy to communicate with and they staff their rooms with a teacher and aide, not just with the minimim ratio. The location is well lit, the restrooms in the 2-4 year old rooms are centrally located so they can be seen from anywhere in the adjacent rooms. They provide great on site activities and crafts and they worked with my daughters delays with ease. They provide daily updates and photos and even let me watch the closed circuit TVs from the directors office during my daughter&apos;s first week. \\n\\nWhat initially got me in the door was a review stating that their child has a bad first day and the director held the child and rocked them until the child was calm and I will say, they did not disappoint. If we didn&apos;t move out of the area, my daughter would still be there. When we left, they made a book of memories that still brings happy memories and a tear to my eyes. \\n\\nIf I had any complaint, it would be that they set the bar so high I still cannot find a daycare where I live now that doesn&apos;t completely pale in comparison to Kiddie Academy in Streamwood.",

My son has had problems with transitions in the past and did not like going to school. His transitions have gotten so much better and now he asks to go to school!\\n\\nThe curriculum is aligned to have him Kindergarten ready. It amazes me since I see his progress in a daily bases with the daily Tadpole reports (pictures of him participating in all curriculum activities) and just in him.\\n\\nHis teachers Ms. Amy and Ms. Julie Ann are truly the reason why my son is flourishing in developmental milestones and academics. They nurture and care for him as he was their own child. I can&apos;t say enough of how my husband and I appreciate everything they do!\\n\\nThe center is very clean and inviting. The entire office staff are very knowledgeable about all their students that attend. They are very helpful and very inviting.  All the holiday parties that they put on our very thoughtful and organized. They are very family centered, which makes dropping off my son a lot easier.\\n\\nAs a parent we want the best for our children, and I truly feel that Kiddie Academy is truly the best for ALL children. I love this place and wish my son started earlier!!",

            "description": "My son isn&apos;t a cookie cutter kid by any means.  He has a little bit of a speech delay and he wasn&apos;t 100% potty trained when we brought him here.  He&apos;s also pretty introverted, but he is brilliant and he likes to work alone.  At first I liked the program and I appreciated getting pictures of him every day.  What I did not like were the teachers.  One teacher in particular just made a point to tell me how terrible my son was doing every single day.  I would get calls to pick him up for tantrums and throwing puzzle pieces and allegedly hitting other kids (to which HE told me he either got hit first, or he was defending his friend who was getting picked on by another kid).  Every single day I got a phone call about his behavior.  I felt like they absolutely didn&apos;t want to work with him at all, like they treated him like he was a burden, and that they just didn&apos;t want him there because he was a little different.  I&apos;ve seen a few times when I would come to pick him up that he would either be crying, or he would start crying and the teachers would be standing in the corner talking, or wouldn&apos;t pay any attention to him.  Other kids would run up to him to console him, but not the teachers.\\n\\nI now have him at another similar preschool and he&apos;s doing great.  Within 2 weeks they helped him get fully potty trained.  He doesn&apos;t wear diapers anymore and that&apos;s only after 2 weeks of being there.  He&apos;s also opened up A LOT as far as speech in the past few months after leaving KA.  They actually work with him at his new school.  I&apos;ve had zero reports of him hitting, tantruming, causing problems, or anything bad in general.  They say he&apos;s a great kid, he&apos;s learning fast, and he gets along with EVERYONE, even the kids who are super introverted like he is.  They&apos;re very patient and very willing to work with your child, which is how a daycare/preschool that you pay as much as you would pay for rent/mortgage should be.\\n\\nAll in all I&apos;m really disappointed with the extreme lack of understanding and ability to work with kids that are just a little different. He&apos;s been to two other daycares outside of this one and it&apos;s just in this one that he was demonized and portrayed as that problem trouble maker child.  At the other two daycares I haven&apos;t had any issues. I took him out because after getting so many phone calls I figured maybe he was having issues here and they would end up kicking him out for some reason anyways.  But taking him out was a great decision because since then he has blossomed so much.  My advice to anyone looking to go here is if your child is a little introverted, shy, speech delayed, to just look else where because they will not get the attention they need here, the teachers won&apos;t hesitate to call you over every single thing imaginable, and they won&apos;t hesitate to tell you how terrible your kid is doing each day.  There are other daycares in the area for the same price with the same curriculum that do a much better job and have way more patient teachers.",

We were very happy with the challenging, interesting curriculum that was diverse and happened inside as well as outside the classroom. We were impressed with how interested she was in her day there and the daily photos and comments as to what she was doing in each one and why really made a us feel connected. We felt the director always listened to any concerns and welcomed feedback. Would send our second child when the time came.",

As soon as I walked in I knew this was it.  The staff is super nice.  They keep the academy very clean at all times.  The teachers are well educated and really care about the kids.  \\n\\nHere&apos;s an example:\\nOn my son&apos;s first day we were greeted by the owner/director.  She was carrying another little boy who was also new to the academy.  You could see that he had been crying a lot for his mommy.  However, the director was very kind and consoling to the little boy.  She had been carrying him ever since his mommy had dropped him off.  This made me feel great!  I knew that if my son would start crying they would do their best to make him more comfortable.  \\nAt the end of the day, the teacher told me she had rubbed my son&apos;s back to help him take a nap.  How awesome is that?!?!  My son loves his teacher very much and calls her his friend.  \\nI am very grateful to have found a place that gives me peace of mind.",

Never looking frazzled or like they don&apos;t want to be there. For the cost you aren&apos;t nickel-and-dimed about your hours, it&apos;s just 6:30-6:30, and their menu is robust. Some other places we visited had basic food (cereal at least 3 breakfasts a week, for example) but here there is a huge variety of real and fresh foods. Love the app with pictures every day. They recommended showing her the pictures and talking about what she was doing at the beginning (she began daycare at 2) and it really helped her adjust. They will be honest with you if there are issues but they are respectful and helpful with progress and other reports, offering strategies to help the kids. The director knows every child&apos;s name and many will run up and hug her when they see her. That was a really good sign. Altogether a fantastic place!",

            "description": "I have completely different experience at kiddie. My son is 20months. I  stop often during the day to check on him.  I continuously found out that the teachers don&apos;t  help kids in the class during meal time.  He often come back in the afternoon eating anything he lays eyes on and shoveling food to his mouth at dinner time! So make sure you train your little one to be independent.  Also their daily report is not accurate at all.  I was observing outside the classroom several times, how much he ate during lunch, he had a few bites but the daily report says he ate most of them. Hey, I saw with my own eyes, that is NOT TRUE!\\n The kids in his class constantly have running nose, no one picks their noses.  My son had dry blood on his lips one day, he seems to have dry blood inside his nostril as well, but surprisingly nobody knows what has happened to him. I understand it is normal to have dry nose, how come nobody saw it...not even the teachers in the class, who are with him for 10hrs??? Then One day I picked him up 2hrs after i dropped him off for a dr appt, he had poop and pee leaking through the diaper when we get to the dr. When i got the daily report I saw the record changing his diaper at 10:30 which is after i picked him up. How in the world did that happen?  Teachers are supposed to TAKE CARE of the kids, I dont see that either.  The teacher gave him 2oz milk and told me he drank all 8oz, one day they forgot to dump the milk in the container i brought. OMG  \\nI am moving him to another daycare. And since I dis-enrolled him, the teacher put away his bin in the closet and removed his name on the wall the next day,comparing this to the beginning, it took them a month to stick our family picture on the wall?!\\n\\nIt looks like all big happy family on the surface, but i now seriously doubt the reliability of the teachers and the accuracy of the daily report and suspect if my son has been taking care of during the day there in the past few months.  I suggest parents to do more research and check on your kids if you can during first few days or weeks. And watch the behavior changes of your kids.  My son gets scared when we mention daycare and he start getting very attached to the items we brought from home with him to daycare,which clearly shows clearly he is not enjoy a bit spending time there!  Do you want your kids become like that?",

Every single week, our son learns something from going here. He absolutely loves her, and the other kids. When we drop him off, he gives her a huge smile and holds his arms out to her - never ever has he been upset when we&apos;ve dropped him off to her - this is a HUGE relief for this full-time working mom. Just a heads up, she loves these kids like a grandma and feels bad when they don&apos;t all get to eat the same treats at lunch.

She said that she would send me a copy by mail, several months passed and I never received anything, until I emailed her letting her know that I had the right to have a copy, (apparently to this district we had no rights) well, I got a reply from other person saying that she would  mail me a copy, they did what they wanted to do and I got a copy by mail. \\n\\nI really wish I could say something positive but honestly I can&apos;t, I thought my kids were in great schools. We never had an issue or complaint about this district, until they decided to handle a very serious situation to their own way, (as the IEP) which is not acceptable, apparently the manic brat didn&apos;t only made them to perform a pathetic actuation but also made them sabotage the IEP, the disability you all suffer in your hearts cannot be cured too. Also I was not happy about something the social worker said. It was not professional and maybe if she makes a little reserch about the students disabilities, she might be able to learn that kids with disabilites have good days and bads as well, maybe she will have some empathy and watch her big mouth. maybe?  And the fact that my previous review was reported and deleted that doesn&apos;t mean I have changed my mind about these two, you all can say no to your leader and respect your work ethics but seems like most of you just follow orders from your leader, and that shows nothing but how unprofessional, heartless &amp; cold blood you all can be and worst part is that they perfectly know that and they don&apos;t care, they only have empathy for their job position. \\n\\nIf this district could respect the code of conduct policy it would be so much easier but apparently they choose who to apply the code of conduct and to who not, also I&apos;d say officers are assigned to schools for a reason, let them DO their job.",

            "description": "Both of our children have been attending Streamwood Montessori for a little over a year. We switched from a well-known corporate daycare for numerous reasons. Enrolling them with Teresa and Streamwood Montessori is one of the best decisions we&apos;ve made. Teresa is wonderful and has a staff that truly cares and builds relationships with our children. We have seen them develop exponentially, and in ways that our previous daycare provider could not accomplish. I would recommend Streamwood Montessori to any parent.",

            "description": "When searching for a new school for my 2 year old, I was SO nervous and worried and had anxiety for weeks. How do you pick one? When your child is away from you longer than you get to see them at home, it&apos;s extremely important you place your trust into the caregivers helping raise your child. The minute I stepped into the school, I was welcomed. Every teacher we have had there is beyond qualified to do their job. They love on our babies like they were their own. My then 2 year old is now 6 and in the lower elementary program there, thriving. She was reading so early on and flying through workpapers and &quot;work&quot; like you wouldn&apos;t believe. We have since had a second child who started at the school when she was 3 months old. With every bump we ran into with breastfeeding a baby and her not taking a bottle, the school and staff worked with me and educated the rest of the staff on what we all learned. For example, breastfed babies have more runny BM diapers than a baby with formula. After discussing this with the staff and director, they had required all staff to read up on the different types of BM&apos;s and sign off that they understood. I was so moved that they took my advice and information so seriously and made sure that training was provided. They are always there to answer a call or email or text and I feel SO comfortable leaving my children there every day. I really love the education my children receive there from all the amazing teachers. They also have an outstanding summer program where they incorporate so many fun activities and events all while they continue to learn and grow.  This really is a great school :)",

Like many parents facing the need of finding care for their child in order to return to work, we went back and forth over many options.  Streamwood Montessori has been amazingly patient and emotionally supportive to me and my transition of going back to work after being able to stay home for 11 months with my daughter.  She loves it, and it makes me happy to see her smiling every time I pick her up.  I love the teachers there and you can really tell they are genuinely caring for your child.   After our first week there, I can honestly say that these women are truly my angels.  Thank you so much!",

I would keep her here through college if I could! My very first impression was the incredibly sweet staff. I went in for an interview &amp; was blown away at the organization &amp; cleanliness of the whole school. There were tons of educational activities &amp; &quot;stations&quot;, very bright &amp; colorful posters &amp; materials on the walls, &amp; even class pets! Everything was put in its place &amp; the entire environment was just SO charming I never wanted to leave. My child is the &quot;baby&quot; &amp; has a VERY willful temperament, but the teachers won us over almost instantly &amp; proved to me that my daughter CAN be taught self-control and self-direction. Not only have they helped her develop important social &amp; personal skills, but her learning there is astounding. I just found out this week that she is learning multiplication! At SIX years old! We all love her teacher(s), &amp; I have VERY much enjoyed volunteering as much as I can with her class. The *only* problem I have had is that the tuition is very pricey, which I can&apos;t personally afford after this year. Breaks my heart!",

The building is charming and well cared for with lots of visual interest and home comforts for the kiddos such as a tiny bathroom that is easy for them to use, an indoor play house, etc. They have a covered back patio area for days where they want to be outside but under cover from sun or rain and a gorgeous outside playground with lots of places to play with friends. They have a little pool (with safety gate and all precautions in place) and small area with a garden. There is a groundskeeper that lives on site and keeps things tidy and maintained. Lots of security cameras and alarm systems in place. They use the Procare app for payments, communications and daily check ins/outs. They also use the app to share videos and pictures of what your little one is doing throughout the day. For Covid protocols, they take your little ones temperature when they enter and immediately have them put their things away and wash their hands at the little kids sink. They communicate any changes in protocol quickly and effectively through the app or in person as needed. All employees wear masks and encourage/assist the children with wearing theirs as appropriate and follow local and state mandates to the best of my knowledge. My son loves his little class and teachers, he is always excited to go to Snell&apos;s and they do sweet things for holidays like special parties and safe treats for them. I really love this place, they provide consistent care and seem to truly enjoy the kiddos. I&apos;m a pretty anxious mom and Snell&apos;s makes me feel really good about leaving my son to play everyday. Thanks Snells!",

            "description": "As a Kohl student, my daughter has had the opportunity to participate for two years in an organization founded at Kohl, Student Stewards of the Lower Calaveras (SSLCR). They have an ongoing fieldwork project on a section of the Calaveras between the school, which is near Stagg HS, and the University of the Pacific. Their teacher and two retired university science professors are teaching them how to do real fieldwork. They distinguish native plants from invasive plants and identify (and plot on a map) all of the plant, insect, and animal species that they find. Last week, a volunteer group from Kohl planted some native species of plants on a Saturday. One student road his bike across town to get there. My daughter, who is part of the PR group in SSLCR, walked over to take pictures to document the event. Her class gives presentations to local organizations such as the Audubon Society and, later this year, they will visit a couple third-grade classes at another school. I think it is safe to say that this sort of thing does not happen at every school.\\n\\nThis is a small school where, as their theme song says, &quot;everybody knows your name.&quot; Two or three grade levels are taught in the same classroom. Older students mentor younger students, and the students learn how to manage their time balancing &quot;menu work&quot; listed in the board (e.g., daily math) with ongoing projects such as SSLCR. They&apos;ve been working this way for 46 years now and somehow have managed not to lose their soul during all those years when SUSD doubled down on direct instruction, corporate curriculum, and worksheet after worksheet. Now all of the employment trends point to the need for the types of skills and personal qualities that this school cultivates: responsibility, collaboration, problem solving, and emotional intelligence. Wake up, SUSD. You&apos;ve had this gem for nearly half of century. It&apos;s time expand this model of project-based learning and give this school the recognition it deserves.",

It&apos;s great working with students who really want to learn, and I have met many nice parents/family members along the way  I love seeing that &quot;ah ha!&quot; expression on a student&apos;s face once a problem makes sense. Often times a student would say, &quot;Ugh I hate these king of problems,&quot; and after going over it with them, it gives me joy to hear the student say, &quot;that wasn&apos;t that bad actually.&quot;",

It&apos;s a bit hidden, but well worth searching for!\\nI took my son who is a student here so we could spend a little time together one day between his classes and I was absolutely amazed. \\nThe service was so friendly! The decor is nice with linen table cloths and napkins; you feel like you&apos;ve been whisked away to a little  5 star restaurant. The prices are more than reasonable and everything we ordered was delicious! Many looked like little works of art. \\nThere were a few issues with organization, time management, etc of course but that is to be expected in a learning environment. \\nI am so glad we found this little gem and I can&apos;t believe it wasn&apos;t packed full of people. I guess the secret&apos;s not out yet. I will be back the next chance I get!",

There&apos;s light music.  There&apos;s even a few outdoor tables complete with a sun-umbrella.  \\n\\nSometimes you get a novice server but they&apos;re never rude.  The food is a leap of faith:  sometimes they knock it out of the park and on a few occasions it was average.  But I&apos;ve always LOVED something (or more than a few) things on my plate.  They are much more accomodating regarding dietary restrictions, the veggies are fresh and so are the desserts!  \\n\\nThe desserts are to die for...you MUST leave space for dessert or else you&apos;ll hate yourself as you drool over something about to be devoured at another table.  \\n\\nLast week I had a great chicken tagine and for the sweet stuff -  chocolate lava cake with raspberry drizzle...OMG it was LUSCIOUS!  \\n\\nAlso, I took a friend to lunch here and as it was her birthday I asked the servers to sing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; when they brought her dessert out.  They did one better, they sang and wrote &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; on her plate in chocolate!   \\n\\nYou are NOT going to get this kind of food value in Stockton, I guarantee you.  \\n\\nHey - tip well, these students pool their tip $$$ for an end-of-the-school-year trip to the Bay for a culinary tour.  \\n\\nINSIDERS TIP:  They have a Student Chef Hot Plate Express inside the cafeteria.  For $5.50, you get a hot entree with a carb and veggie -  the most bang for your buck!  Again, I&apos;ve never been disappointed.  They also have a cold counter where they have sandwiches and salads.  \\n\\nNo - they haven&apos;t paid me off.  They deserve all the accolades and then some!\\n\\nHere&apos;s a link to the menu, but if you take my corner table by the window I&apos;ll have to kill you.  Slowly.  I&apos;m just kidding.  Well, not really. :)\\n\\nhttp://www.deltacollege.edu/dept/foodservice/student_chef/menu.html",

If you&apos;re going to bother splurging on buying a school lunch because you left the brown bag at home, I highly suggest shelling out a few extra bucks here rather than eating in the cafeteria. The food is fresher, tastier, and seemingly healthier; plus you&apos;re helping students refine their food industry skills. I&apos;ve been twice so far this semester, and loved the relish that comes w/ the potstickers; the Cornish game hen w/ butternut squash &amp; spinach was tasty too. Keep it coming!",

The outside community is the polar opposite of UOP. UOP kinda looks like a miniature version of Harvard (never been there...but I just googled it, so I think you can trust me). When I went to the Chevron just five minutes outside of UOP though, I felt like I was back in a more ghetto version of San Jose&apos;s Alum Rock (don&apos;t worry, I grew up there-ish). \\n\\nBut anyways, I never was a student here, so I have nothing else to say.

And never been to her campus till my friend&apos;s graduation day because I as well was going to school full-time and had a semi-part time job to pay off my student loans as quick as I can before interest kicks in while going to school full time as well.. We both understand, but kept in touch via FaceTime or when we both visit back home almost at the same time for the holidays to catch up. \\n\\nBoy, during graduation day, I must say what a huge crowd of Pharmacists and Future Doctors... Very impressed! :) Great school to go to if you&apos;re majoring in the medical field, other than that, look else where, since University of the Pacific is well known to have a good reputation for future students majoring in the Pharmacist Field.\\n\\nIve always wanted to go to UOP back several years ago as an under graduate, but the price to go to this school deterred me away when I did my research online without even visiting the Dean nor the campus itself in person... But after now just scrolling down to READ ALL the under 3 rating reviews or less... I see a clearer picture of how some students felt cheated out of their education. \\n\\nIm not going to voice any more of my opinion about this University since Im not a student nor didn&apos;t go to this school, but great campus though. And am definitely listening to the people who posted THE REAL WORLD issues here on THE PRICE IT COST to go to this school... Some scary stuff! \\n\\nI advice any new prospect students, is to do some research, read all the 3 or less star reviews, and that&apos;ll paint a clearer picture if you think its worth it to go to this school, open up a student loan, and be forever in debt paying that loan back. \\n\\nAnyways, good luck on your endeavors future doctors if you decide to go to this school. :)\\n\\nPS: Was told that 1/2 the students here find their husbands/wifes here, and can get a discount going to the chapel if you&apos;re a UOP student.... BONUS yo! &quot;May I pronounce you, Husband and Wife, you may now kiss.&quot;",

            "description": "No, no, no, NO! You&apos;re all WRONG! Please read this, especially if you are a prospective student.\\n\\nI was at UOP for four years of undergraduate, plus a couple years of graduate school. The good part is that I&apos;ve got two valuable degrees and a small handful of good memories. But believe me, I&apos;ve seen a lot of what&apos;s changed at UOP and I know for a fact that it&apos;s not even close to being worth it. Not anymore. So don&apos;t post here with your &quot;The commencement ceremony was great! Five stars!&quot; or &quot;I was here in &apos;97 and I loved it!&quot; or &quot;I made so many friends!&quot; You&apos;re influencing other people&apos;s decisions and it&apos;s wrong.\\n\\nHere&apos;s why:\\nI&apos;m not sure that you all understand just how expensive this school is. You will spend $40,000-$50,0000 per year for undergraduate and $50,000-60,000 per year for graduate (think housing, meal plan, books, tuition, graduation/admin costs, parking fees). I was personally mislead (maybe even lied to) by a Dean when he told me in person that I could probably do graduate school for $30k/year. I kid you not. I paid $60k/year. Goodluck getting a scholarship to cover that.\\n\\nSo how do you justify these costs? Quality of education? If you major in anything but some type of Engineering, Comp Sci, Accounting, or maybe Biochem you&apos;re S.O.L. and will have a very hard time finding a job. Pharmacy almost made this list because UOP does have a crazy hard and reputable pharma program. But there&apos;s very few quality pharma jobs out there from what I hear. I was fortunate enough to choose a decent major, but I still had a brutal time getting a good job. I suspect it&apos;s because during interviews I said &quot;I went to UOP,&quot; and got one of two responses: &quot;Never heard of it.&quot; or &quot;Oh, University of Phoenix Online. You don&apos;t say.&quot; \\n\\nSure, some of the professors (maybe 20-30%) are exceptional. But they&apos;re also the most busy. I found that most professors either needed to retire, dislike their students, or simply don&apos;t have any passion. It&apos;s a disgrace. And if you think they get paid well because tuition is high then you&apos;re wrong. In fact, I&apos;ve heard many of them voice complaints about how little they&apos;re paid. I spent a couple of summers taking courses at a different college and I was stunned by how much clearer their instruction was. And guess what? It literally cost me less than 5% of what I paid at UOP.\\n\\nAlright, so it&apos;s not in-classroom education that&apos;s worth it. \\n\\nMaybe UOP makes up for it&apos;s costs with a vibrant social scene? I was in a Greek house at UOP for many years. It was great - everyone had a good time, nothing bad happened because we were careful and responsible. Unfortunately, this wasn&apos;t the case with many other houses. There were multiple alleged rape incidents over the years. The school shut everything down. The bulk of the party scene has since moved off-campus where the school doesn&apos;t have to accept legal liability. \\n\\nThis would&apos;ve been fine if UOP wasn&apos;t in Stockton, which is unanimously agreed to be a disastrous place to live. There are currently over 70 gangs in Stockton. 70. It&apos;s bankrupt. There is no police force. People still get mugged on the bridge near north campus. Granted, the campus police do a decent job of controlling what they can, but it&apos;s no joke. Sure, you can go to clubs and do sports on-campus. That helps. But overall it&apos;s a big stretch to call it socially &quot;thriving.&quot; More like high school part two unless you want to risk getting robbed and shot by a gang (this actually happened to students I know).\\n\\nSo where does the school&apos;s $204 million in annual revenue go? Go ahead and look at their website. I don&apos;t know what &quot;General Administration&quot; and &quot;General Institutional&quot; are, but for a combined $101 million dollars I doubt it&apos;s doing much for anybody except the people that run UOP. And $62.5 million in financial aid? So the school costs students a lot because it&apos;s aiding students? How does that make sense? Probably just means a free ride for somebody&apos;s relatives.\\n\\nOne last thing I want to talk about is the school&apos;s technical department. UOP&apos;s internet has about 90% uptime. It&apos;s horrendous. Most organizations with this many resources have 99% uptime. Add to that their awful support and technical management. I had my PC broken into by one of their staff without my permission and they literally broke it. I didn&apos;t even get an apology.\\n\\nLook, my point is that we should be more upset about schools like this. I didn&apos;t get to where I am because I went to a good school. I got here by reading on my own, and doing real things in my field, and working nonstop, and figuring it out without UOP&apos;s help. Don&apos;t let this happen to you.\\n\\nProspective students: Don&apos;t go here unless you&apos;re ready to suffer. You&apos;ve been warned.\\nFormer students: Please complain. Talk about it. Warn others. \\nSchool officials: Lower tuition. Help students prepare for real jobs. Oh yeah, and stop $@^&amp;ing calling me for money because you won&apos;t get another cent, bloodsuckers.",

            "description": "I LOVED PACIFIC! Still love it! \\nI had gone to the orientation for University of Arizona and hated the weather and called UOP in July asking them if I could still come. \\nSure. \\nDo I still have my scholarship? \\nYes. \\n\\nI was in for the best 5 years of my life. \\n\\nIt&apos;s a private school where everybody knows about everybody else&apos;s dirty business. After two years at this school you will most likely know everybody on campus. College is what you make of it, and with the pre-pharm schedule I was able to rush and pledge a sorority, two professional fraternities and join a dance crew in my two years of undergrad. It&apos;s do-able and I&apos;ve had friends who have pledged a sorority and fraternity in the same semester. You just need to put your mind to it. \\n\\nPacific is fun! Things like fashion shows, sorority and fraternity charity events, TEDx, comedians and singers at the Lair, and rock guarding (actually rockguarding is not fun) are all happening right on campus! But there are also the lame parts, like not having a car, everybody cheating in classes, gaining the freshmen 30, and so forth.  \\n\\nGranted, us folks in the accelerated program sometimes wonder why anybody would pay so much at a private school to get a major in say, Art. (I love art! My dad wouldn&apos;t let me go to a UC because he was afraid I&apos;d change my major to art). Otherwise, the 3 years of pharmacy school is great: there are tons of ways to get involved with leadership opportunities, research, make friends, and continue on with the profession. \\n\\nStockton itself is also not as bad as everybody says it is. They only say so because they&apos;re so scared that they haven&apos;t been anywhere outside of campus. There are ballet classes in Stockton, really good restaurants in Lodi, wine festivals and so forth. College is what you make of it. If I could do it over again, I would choose Pacific every time.",

Also they provide students with study rooms, even electronic journals and books that can be accessed anywhere online!! \\n\\nNot only that they have great well-educated professors who actually care and take time to help you in your educational needs! I had a professor who had her emails sent to get Blackberry.. (This was before iPhones haha ) and once she replied back to be in a record of a minute!!! Now that&apos;s dedication!\\n\\nThey offer small class sizes which can be from 8 to 90 (in the case of a bio g.e class, but I have never seen that limit reach before).\\n\\nOverall, I am very happy being a tiger! Go UOP!",

I love the campus, the small classes, Greek system and the great education I received.\\n\\nI made some really great friends as a student and have some great memories.  I remember trying to decide which dorm to live in freshman year.  A good friend who was a student at UOP told me Grace Covell was THE place to live.  I also remember going through rush, getting my bid and initiation.  Fraternity parties and exchanges were definite highlights.  I was both excited and sad during graduation.  No more safety net of college.  \\n\\nI look back fondly at my years at UOP and at times, wish I could go back and relive those days.",

There is a general session for everyone, plus after the general session, each school had its own smaller session. \\n\\nAfter parking at the campus, there were lots of signs directing you to the ceremony. There were also information booths staffed with ambassadors and maps to help you navigate. Restrooms were also well signed. \\n\\nNow the ceremony. It was approaching 100 degrees, luckily we found a seat in the shade. A huge plus were the refreshment tents, offering free sodas, water, and fruit. They also handed out fans for souvenirs, which came in handy. \\n\\nBest part was the short speeches. We got out of there in an hour! All university graduations should be like this.",

            "description": "Disclaimer: the review I am writing is geared towards the sciences.\\n\\nI went here for my B.S. in Biological Sciences and just graduated in May. I really enjoyed my time here at Pacific. The professors are all so nice and willing to help their students. The class sizes are small, even for general science courses. My friends at larger universities are always complaining about how there are too many people in their general science courses, so they can&apos;t get to know their professors. Then when it comes time for them to get a letter of recommendation from a professor for their professional program, they don&apos;t know who to approach. This definitely isn&apos;t a problem at UOP. I know all of my professors, and talk to them in office hours all the time. When I applied for medical school, I was able to get letters from 1 professor in the Mathematics Department, 1 from the Chemistry Department, and 2 from the Biology Department. Another thing that my friends complain about a lot is not being able to get a research position at their university. At UOP, I was able to obtain a research position during my second semester there. I also got a fellowship grant and a departmental award to fund my research. Right now as someone who just graduated with a bachelors, I also have 2 scientific publications, so I am very satisfied with this university.",

I don&apos;t know why english, history, etc students would even want to major here.  The night life is not that good here and we get emails on a weekly basis on how a student was held up at gun point or was almost raped while running around campus.  It is a beautiful school but I don&apos;t think that should be it&apos;s winning factor.\\n\\nThe undergrad science teacher are pretty horrible and the chemistry department is constantly getting new teacher because we never get anyone thats worth keeping.  One of my past chemistry teachers even lied on her resume about her credentials.  GOOD JOB FILTERING UOP.\\n\\nEven though I&apos;m pretty much ranting on and on but I did make some pretty great friends here.  I am currently in pharmacy school and it&apos;s a lot better because the classes are more interesting and the curriculum was just updated 2 years ago so it&apos;s up to date.\\n\\np.s.

If you have children (toddlers) with any behaviors whatsoever I&apos;d think twice about enrolling them here. This place has no patience or compassion for children who may possibly be on the spectrum, but are to young to be diagnosed. They didn&apos;t try to see how they could accommodate her to see what works for her, what intrigues her, what she&apos;s interested in so that she could be calm and quiet during nap time. They just gave up! According to them nap time is mandatory, and she was being disruptive. You can&apos;t force a child to go to sleep! God forbid your child be on a different sleep routine and not as quiet as a mouse at this place, they will just get rid of them. Children who are different didn&apos;t ask to be born that way. They kindly told my daughter on multiple occasions that maybe she should look into another daycare that could possibly help her. And made my daughter and granddaughters life that much more difficult. This just saddens me. I will never recommend this heartless place to any family.",

            "description": "My daughter just had her last day at kindercare yesterday 03-14-22 and had started just in late august of last year. In the beginning everything seemed fine, but then the complaints started coming in. Before I go into detail I must start by saying my daughter is on the spectrum of autism and I will admit she is a bit difficult but what 2 year old isn&apos;t. The first complaint about my daughter I had received from them was that their nap time was &quot;mandatory &quot; and if their kiddos didn&apos;t take a nap then it would be a problem. They had told me that my daughter was having a hard time taking naps and would disrupt other kids and that supposedly other parents were complaining about why their kids were looking so tired so basically they were trying to blame my daughter for other kids not getting sleep. Then their second excuse was that she would have &quot;rough days&quot; and be disruptive during circle time etc. Not once was I told that they tried accommodating her all I received were complaints. Sometimes when I would drop and pick her up I felt an unwanted feeling towards my daughter which feels horrible for a parent and no parent should feel this. I know my daughter is no angel but I believe every kid deserves a chance. When we had our tour for the center before my daughter started we were told that they do help with potty training at the center and to just let them know when she&apos;s ready, that was not the entire truth, I had told one of the main ladies who was in the class that I was starting potty training at home and if they could help do it while my daughter was in their care and her response was with a unwelcoming expression &quot;no I dont think were going to do that yet&quot; completely shut me down and didn&apos;t even consider it ! One of the main ladies at the center had also mentioned that if these problems were to continue then their only option would be to un enroll her. So I had no other choice but to find her a new daycare to go to. Once I had found a new daycare and I explained my situation to them they even said themselves that the whole situation from kindercare was unfortunate and that they actually have a kid who is on the spectrum there and they do everything in their power to accommodate him hooray to them!! Thats how kindercare should be but I guess they just want the easy way out. On the other hand when I told one of the administration ladies that my daughter would be leaving soon her reaction was &quot; im so happy, oh no I didn&apos;t mean it like that&quot; and her eyes lit up like a weight was off her shoulders. How unfortunate and disrespectful is that. I felt offended. So to end my rant I just want to warn parents if you are thinking of enrolling your child and they are on the spectrum or even a bit difficult be aware of what happened to me and my daughter.",

            "description": "I&apos;m an Alumnus, and proud to be. I&apos;ve scanned some of the negative reviews, and having attended a 4 year school after getting my associate&apos;s degree, I can address some the issues mentioned and relate them to another community college or university.  I had a great time, made great friends, had amazing classes and teachers, and even participated in extracurriculars. I&apos;ve gone back, post graduation, to take some continuing ed classes, as well as to meet with the career center. I would recommend this school to anyone. \\n\\nTEACHERS\\nI attended Harper for 3 years, and took classes across a variety of subjects, disciplines, etc. Yes, I had some weird teachers (my sociology teacher wasn&apos;t a bad teacher, but he was super weird and I found his approach to be... weird. However, I still learned a lot and ultimately enjoyed the class), I had some bad teachers (my chemistry teacher was an adjunct, and not awesome). I also had some amazing teachers, including some who are still at Harper. Bad teachers (or teachers you don&apos;t get along with) are not unique to Harper, or any school. Adjuncts in general are underpaid, and the one adjunct I had was a high school teacher who drove to Harper to teach after school. Yeah, he was sometimes late, but then again, so was I - and for the same reason, traffic. One of the benefits of college is that you often have options for which teacher/section - do your research and talk to other students/teachers/consult online review websites. \\n\\nCOST/WITHDRAWING\\nHarper was far cheaper than the 4 year school I attended, which is one of the reasons I started at Harper (that and to find out what I wanted to major in). My average cost at Harper was, if I remember, roughly $2-$4k a semester for full time. University was $15 - $20k per semester for full time. In terms of policies related to dropping a class - every school has their own dropping/refund policies, and they are always clearly stated on the school&apos;s website/in their materials. I think when I attended, you were allowed to drop/switch sections with no penalty/a refund for the first week of semester/class. After that time, you could drop (but still had to pay) for another 8 weeks (example) and after that, you weren&apos;t allowed to withdrawal without it showing up on your transcript (so that you couldn&apos;t reach the last week, realize you weren&apos;t going to get the grade you wanted, and drop with no penalty). \\n\\nEvery college/university I have attended (at least 4), have had a similar structure. Drop with refund/not on your transcript by X. Drop with no refund, not on your transcript by Y. Drop with it on your transcript as a W by Z. No drops allowed after that. None of them allowed a partial refund, you either dropped in time for a refund, or you didn&apos;t. This is normal, and standard.\\n\\nPARKING\\nYes, certain buildings hold more classes/are more populated and trying to park in the lots closest to the building can be difficult. There is ALWAYS parking available, it just may not be the closest to your building. Lots on the backside campus, like Lots 12, 13, and 14 always had spots available. ALWAYS. If the complaint is that it&apos;s too long a walk to class, or between buildings, it is comparable or better than other community colleges I&apos;ve been to, and a standard university. Most universities charge for parking, and the lots are often far away. Walking is good for you, it&apos;s exercise, and you&apos;re going to have to walk around no matter where you attend school. That is not a Harper issue.",

Unfortunately I was out of district when I graduated from high school.\\n\\nI was turned off by community college when I went to COD I felt like I was just tossed into school. I didnt understand what I was doing and lacked guidance. I came from immigrant parents so, I really didn&apos;t have anyone to help me through my decision making since they never went to college. There wasn&apos;t an orientation or supporting staff that helped guide me I was just &quot;there&quot;. I took a different route and went to vocational school feeling that was the choice for me.\\n\\nFast forward to now, recently I decided it was time to give college a try again so I showed up to Harper (Yes!! this time I&apos;m in district) and told them about myself, my career background and what I wanted out of college. Every single step of the way they have provided me with assistance and support. I went to admissions, filled out paperwork, registered. Then I took placement tests, as I&apos;ve been out of school for many years. I Then went to orientation, met with an adviser who helped me pick my classes. Next thing you know Im a college student! \\n\\nI look forward to attending my classes, my professors so far are great. I can tell they are genuinely interested in helping me, love what they do, and make me feel comfortable. Looking forward to a couple more years at Harper.",

            "description": "I just completed an 18-credit Human Resources Certificate via the Fast Track program. From mid-September &apos;15 through mid-May &apos;16, I spent my Tuesday nights from 6 PM - 10 PM taking classes at the Harper Professional Center in Schaumburg. I had to drop out of the last scheduled class in the cohort due to travel plans in June &apos;16, and Harper stepped in and created an independent study section of another HR class just so that I could finish with my cohort by July &apos;16. \\n\\nThe pros: \\n\\n- The Fast Track office is really helpful and professional\\n- Two of the four professors that I had were fantastic, and a third was decent. I have a bachelor&apos;s degree and a master&apos;s degree and that I found two of the most enjoyable lecturers of my long educational career here at this little community college is pretty impressive\\n- My June travel was career-related and I think they showed a lot of caring for me as a single mother and a busy professional by creating an independent study class just for me so that I could graduate\\n- My cohort was great. We had two professors tell us that we were the most enjoyable class they&apos;d ever had, and a third professor liked us so much that she seized us for three of our classes and tried to get us for a fourth (more on that in a second). I made friends here that I think I&apos;ll keep in touch with for years, and it was the cohort model---keeping us together for back-to-back classes---that made that possible. \\n- The schedule allowed me to keep classes away from work and still take care of my kids. \\n- The Rita &amp; John Canning Women&apos;s Program paid for ALL of my textbooks and tuition and fees because I am a single mother. That&apos;s all six 3-credit classes and the books. (Harper actually gave me my last textbook for free because the textbook company sent them a sample, which was nice of them. We didn&apos;t have to use women&apos;s program funding for that one.)\\n\\nThe cons: \\n\\n- We were paired with the same teacher for 3 out of 6 classes, and she tried to snag our cohort for a 4th class, but another teacher signed up for us first. Most of us found this teacher to be frustrating and difficult and would not have wanted more than 1-2 classes with her; we wanted to pull our hair out when we saw we would have a third class with her. There was another HR cohort that met at the exact same time for the exact same classes, but Harper adamantly refused to let any of us switch to the other cohort. Harper really needs to change some policies in order to ensure variety in cohort schedules. \\n- There is a weird textbook racket at Harper. Professors are required to assign really expensive books from companies like McGraw-Hill, even if they think they are terrible textbooks and don&apos;t want to use them. New editions are frequently released and the bookstore seldom sells used or buys back your books. \\n\\nIn the end, 10 of the 16 members of my cohort graduated on-time, and several others should be done in the fall, which is not a bad ratio. Overall my experience with Harper was a good one and I am so pleased with my HR certificate and the efforts that Harper faculty made towards helping me succeed. If I still live in the northwest suburbs area in 8 years, I would be honored if my daughter chose to pursue an Associate&apos;s at Harper.",

(especially the one just because of slow internet)\\n\\nDue to family circumstances I had to drop University and work. 2 years later, getting back into school led me to Harper. For my Associates Degree, I only had one teacher that proved an issue and was fired thus removing said issue for future students. I had a few adjunct faculty members along the way and had no issue, save for the previously mentioned. Most of my teachers though, had their Ph.D and quite a few also taught part-time at the larger universities. \\n\\nI felt challenged and really ready for University again thanks to Harper. I got great grades, joined their Honors Club and their chapter of the International Honors Society, Phi Theta Kappa. I got involved, I created relationships with teachers, and I loved my experience. \\n\\nFrom several friends of mine, their Nursing Program is one of the best 2-year RN programs around. Their dental hygienist program is also apparently quite competitive and great. \\n\\nIf you value education but cannot quite afford the big ticket price of a 4-year university, start at Harper and get more than your money&apos;s worth.",

            "description": "I attended this school for one semester. While at this school, the best experiences I had were neutral. The grounds are nice and well kept, but there are a lot of problems with the way the university operates under the hood. First, some of the adjunct faculty are not of the best quality. My statistics professor was always late. She also made transphobic remarks on multiple occasions and was generally unkind to the students. I can&apos;t imagine how uncomfortable a trans or LGBTQ+ student would be in her class. She also would call students out if they were covered by the ADA for extra time and make them come in front of the class to talk to her where everyone could view the ADA student and listen to their conversation (the process is supposed to respect the students privacy). Parking is also bad. On most days, you will have to walk up to half a mile through the parking lot to your classroom. Parking gets filled up VERY quickly. You have to be extremely early to get a decent spot. This is especially bad during the winter months. They have a parking garage, but it is expensive to get a pass and it shouldn&apos;t be needed. Many of the students are fresh out of high school. Many students do not wish to take college courses, but take them due to family expectations. This leads to some bad learning situations. Students will be on their phones, talking, or interrupting the teacher. The overall student populations vibe is not one that values or is serious about education. The college police is very unhelpful and in most cases inconsiderate to the students. The administration follows this trend as well. Academic advising meetings are short, and if you are a student with ADA or other situations happening within the school, you will have to work very hard to get your needs met. This is because the departments do not communicate with each other very well at all. I am glad I transferred. I could not imagine another year at this community college.",

While I&apos;ve read things that may be problematic and require correction, they didn&apos;t shape my student experience.\\n\\nAdministration: Passable. Generally I could get the things done in one or two visits. There is a marked lack of communication and system integration between related departments, such as financial aid and the business office. I ran into problems where, even though my request was within policy guidelines, home-grown software limitations caused problems. Student employees usually provided the best service.\\n\\nFaculty: The permanent staff I encountered were all quite good, some first rate. The adjunct faculty was VERY hit and miss.\\n\\nCohort: Most students I encountered were disappointing. There are several who were great stand-outs, but most presented themselves as entitled and lacking awareness. I took one class with a terrible adjunct who&apos;s &quot;review&quot; immediately before the exams included ONLY the exam answers, and somehow there was a curve. Students got C&apos;s on multiple choice exams that they received the answers to immediately beforehand. This is the level of student you will most commonly encounter. (And this is probably some of our coworkers now.)\\n\\nHarper is a little expensive for a community college, but it has some great resources, good faculty, and some motivated, sharp students. This is the kind of college where YOU really determine what you get; if you really try, you can get a pretty good jump on your education, but if you slack, you can escape with a C average and not learn anything.",

Yup, Harper High, the University of Southern Palatine, whatever you want to call it, I loved Harper community college.\\n\\nSo what did my four years get me?  Well, in addition to a goofy &quot;Associate of Science&quot; degree, I was able to take a wide and varied assortment of classes with universally good professors for one.  Because Harper focuses on preparing students for transition to a 4-year program, they cover everything in the book!  Friends who started at 4-year schools had the &quot;benefit&quot; of skipping book sections/topics which the professor could be confident would not be needed later in that particular school&apos;s curriculum.  Not at Harper- we covered everything, which meant serious learning!  When I finally transferred, I found Harper had taught me as well or better than my non-transfer peers.\\n\\nThe other great part about Harper was the cheap tuition!  Cheap classes meant I could take whatever I wanted, including a bunch of interesting electives/liberal arts classes that I couldn&apos;t have fit or afforded at the school I ultimately got my Bachelor&apos;s degree from.  Then there was the time where I doubted if Engineering/Science was my calling- going to Harper gave me the cost flexibility to explore and drop classes that would have been expensive at a 4-year school!  \\n\\nYeah, going to Harper can be challenging because everyone there&apos;s a commuter and it lacks the study-buddy atmosphere.  School based social life is non-existent- it&apos;s hard to not end up treating your parents as hotel proprietors if you have friends in the city.  Owning a car is essential.  But really, none of this is Harper&apos;s fault, and Harper offers all the academic challenge a person could ask for while offering it at a price that makes taking educational chances less costly.  With reasonably hard work I was accepted to transition into the engineering undergrad program I wanted (IIT) and never had any regret about going to Harper.",

If you need help with submitting any kind of petition, you will have to advocate constantly for yourself for anything to get done. I have been going for 4 semesters and never had any problems with the teachers, but the Interim Dean didn&apos;t want to do hardly anything because soon it would be someone else&apos;s problem. You have to push hard to get your needs met by admin and stand up for yourself or they will bully you. Chat is almost useless as you will be waiting for a response after they say &quot;Hello. How May I help you?&quot; Make sure you save ALL your email interactions so you have proof you have been reaching out to the correct channels and just ignored. And in live chat, click on the three dots in the upper left corner of chat to have a transcription of the chat sent to your email so you have proof you were ignored and then the chat was stopped due to lack of interaction. There aren&apos;t many options for community colleges in San Joaquin County, but that is no reason for us to have to deal with admin having a laissez-faire attitude when it comes to our education",

            "description": "Just to be clear; I completed and received my certificate of completion for the LVN; Licensed Vocational Nurse program in 2004 from Delta College. \\n\\nNot sure what has taken me so long to write a review; life I suspect. \\n\\nThe LVN program was an amazing experience and it was a full-time program for one year. It was not easy but I learned so much and it turned my mind into more of a critical thinker not to be confused with being a critic.  Critical thinking is a skill set that can assist a person in making well-thought-out decisions and plans. \\n\\nI had Patricia Noma, RN MSN and I believe she has additional credentialling behind her name and she was strict and a fantastically effective instructor. My clinical&apos;s were at San Joaquin General Hospital in French Camp, California and the OB and Obstetrics portion of the schooling was at St. Joseph&apos;s hospital; I made the right choice for me in choosing San Joaquin General Hospital as it was a teaching facility and I learned so much about the disease process and nursing. \\n\\nThere was another instructor and due to how many years have passed since I graduated in 2004 my memory is only remembering her first name of Nenita. She was amazing as well and taught the majority of our classroom education. Tough, funny, and smart as a whip!\\n\\nI met one of my friends there and we went through the course together and she went on to get her RN and works as an OB nurse now and loves her career. \\n\\nOne area I was heartbroken over and so in disbelief about was how SJDC at the time and for years later forced students to repeat courses (if you wanted to be eligible to apply for programs) due to time frames from when the course was taken to when they were applying for programs such as LVN to RN. What a gimmick and how unfair. MJC does not do this.\\n\\nI switched to Modesto Junior College, MJC, and have had the best experience to date. They have an amazing Disability Services department where if you qualify can be assigned a DSPS (disability services) counselor who works with you to create the most amazing Educational Plans so you know your on the correct track. \\n\\nAlso in this department, are accommodations for those with qualifying disabilities where you can receive extra testing time and other accommodations that for me have assisted me greatly in achieving passing grades each semester. I am now an English major.\\n\\nI had my heart set on transitioning from LVN to RN at Delta College however their continual changing of their programs, prerequisite courses and forcing you to retake courses you originally passed to meet some new guideline wasted years of my life, but made them hundreds of thousands of dollars if not more, as they continued to change requirements; year after year. I would speak with people who endured the same type of unethical actions so I knew I wasn&apos;t alone. Modesto Junior College accepted my coursework from SJDC and has not once informed me I needed to retake courses due to the age of the course. This is how it should be as its ethical and reasonable. \\n\\nI hope for you a better outcome.",

            "description": "I went to their campus last year with my husband for a conference on nursing careers they held, the conference was great but, that campus is not very ADA accessible, they have an elevator which was tiny but if your in a walker or wheelchair, your lucky to fit in it, there is barely room to turn let alone allow more than 2 people in it, the classrooms were by far worse, I have mobility issues and the classrooms were small and I was having a hard time getting into the classrooms with just a walker mobility device, I imagine wheelchairs are nearly impossible, I felt so uncomfortable during that conference because my walker was taking up so much room in the aisle because nobody could get by, that I opted instead to wait outside in the cold on a bench for my husband who was attending the conference lectures. This school is far from accessible! Second, my husband has been attending this school for 3 semesters, and this semester we had to pay out of pocket because during his first semester his GPA was not so great, his second semester was better but, He tried for 3 months prior to his 3rd semester to get help or any information about his PELL Grant because we are a low income family and we rely on his pell grant to get him through school, low and behold after months of no replies to phone calls, emails, and portal messages, he finally got a hold of someone through the chat portal only to find out he was disqualified for his PELL Grant because of his first semester GPA, So, he appealed it, and we have called, emailed, messaged, trying to get some sort of help so he can get information on what&apos;s going on with his appeal, and its been almost 4 months.....4 MONTHS....nobody is returning our messages, our emails, let alone phone calls!! They took the money to pay for his tuition well enough, their good at that....but helping their students when it comes to financial aid.....seems to not exist at all. His semester is almost over and he has not had ANY help from the financial aid department or the school for that matter because nobody ever picks up the phone because.....nobody is there! They left their students to just ponder and sit and wonder as to their educational future!! They dont care at all it seems like and I am truly disappointed at how they are handling the welfare of their students during this pandemic,service or help for their students was not that great before the pandemic, but since the pandemic, everyone but the teachers have disappeared into the veil of shadows never to be seen or heard from again!! I give credit to the teachers who have graciously and patiently dealt with all the students who are coming to them for answers and have kindly and patiently tried to do what they can to answer questions and help, they are to be commended, but this school as far as their handling of their students, their financial department and the handling of answering phones or helping anyones concerns, has been disappointing to say the least, and thats putting it nicely. They have fallen greatly from the once great school they used to be, I truly hope they get their stuff together and make this right for their students!! Truly shameful.",

            "description": "I always hear excuses from the staff that usually are along the lines of, &quot;We have a lot of students and it is hard for us to get to help them as fast as they would like.&quot; This is such a terrible excuse when I attended a college, that at that time had over 10,000 more students in attendance, that was able to meet the needs of the students at such rapid rates. I also attended another college is a rural area that had 1/4 the student and much less than 1/10 the administrative staff that met every need with such expedience. The staff at Delta do not seem to be aware of what is going on with the office next to them, or what is going to happen the next day even. Getting an answer out of the staff is next to impossible, and when you do it sounds like a recorded response and when you rephrase the question you still get the same verbatim answer.\\n\\nThis does not mean that the professors at Delta are all too horrible, in fact they are mostly all quite fantastic. I do not think that there are but a few professors that are a bit off and not quite fit to teach. One professor was asking his students to solicit child pornography and touch people uncomfortably on the shoulder to gauge their response. This did however go unheard by his dean, until a few of us students presented this info to him. We were told by the dean&apos;s office, &quot;We do not know what our professors are doing, it is not our job to keep them in line. It is the job of the student to report to us when something is not right with the classroom or professor.&quot; That seems pretty terrible to me.\\n\\nAnother quarrel I have with the school is the crowding in the classroom. TAKE THIS NOT AS AN EXAGGERATION! There are classrooms that are so incredibly cramped that there is less than 6 inches to walk down isles, so you have to fill up the back row by moving desks then fill to the front. What would happen in a fire, and with only one exit as well? Not up to CA fire codes. Most of the older classrooms have less than 24inches between desks which makes it impossible to get down an aisle without bumping into every student along the way.\\n\\nI was in a classroom that had 64 desks and 3 chairs for students while the Max Occupancy of the class (which was posted) was 48 seated. This school is in serious need of budgeting and the Trustee Board needs a pay cut; if the school is hurting so hard for money, then ask the trustees to take a cut in pay. That would mean they would not be able to buy the new year of the Mercedes SLK 600, but hey, we all have to sacrifice. \\n\\nDO NOT GO HERE IF YOU CAN HELP IT, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. I APPLIED FOR ANOTHER COLLEGE ALREADY, I SUGGEST YOU YOU DO NOT GO HERE.",

Its a small private family operated school that is so professional but has a comfortable feel at the same time. My instructors Melva and Erica were amazing. Im glad i chose this school to do my CNA course..the class was small and very one on one. Our instructors were stricked but very thorough. They want to make sure we know what we&apos;re doing in the field. They are a very understanding and comforting.if your looking for a CNA school go here!!!!",

The classroom lectures provide information to mentally prepare you for the states written test whereas the clinicals helps you prepare for the hands on portion of the state testing. I am proud to say that I graduated out of Bradford career college and was able to find a job within just after two weeks of passing my state testings. \\n\\nI am currently a CNA and is now enrolled in the LVN program hopefully to pursue towards the RN program after. I know I wouldn&apos;t be able to come this far without Bradford and the staff to motivate me. There&apos;s so many positive things I can say about this particular program and the instructors here, but you&apos;ll just have to come see it for yourself. If you want to start your life in the medical field, I suggest you look into Bradford career college.",

They will teach you everything you need to know and more to pass the test and even be ready for employment. If you are serious about learning their instructor is for you! \\n\\nI passed my arc test the first time and felt totally prepared. I met a lot of awesome people that have a compassion for caring.

            "description": "I had a very good experience with Bradford. First, I should say I was very cautious about choosing a program given the fact that some institutions may not be accredited or may not have a level training that could get me into the medical field (at least at the level I wanted). I had a close friend go through the Bradford CNA course and she quickly got into a CNA position and she was happy with who she worked for. It was this and the overall course schedule that showed me it was a cost-effective way to get into the medical field. From the training and getting a job, I&apos;ve been able to gain some solid footing in the field and I&apos;m considering some other options in nursing after I get more experience. As for my training and the outcome from my certification, the following are some main points on my experiences at Bradford and subsequent career opportunities. \\n\\n1) TEACHING. The course was taught primarily by a main instructor, but they had other instructors go through other methods and hands-on training. This is a course to be taken seriously. The teaching philosophy is not one-way, it&apos;s more interactive where the instructor tries to draw answers from the students (not entirely Socratic, but along those lines). The instructors have a teaching and working knowledge of the field, so I got the textbook and real life/hands on experiences from the course. \\n\\n2) TRAINING. When I went through the skills learning and training, there was quite a lot of material. There&apos;s a lot of opportunity to work on these within the course but it didn&apos;t hurt to practice at home as well. What I did find from the center is that I learned all the skills, and did so at a level that when I was applying and interviewing for jobs, I was able to show the potential employer my skills. This seems obvious, but it can be very difficult when you&apos;re in an interview situation.   \\n\\nAlso, I found the required training in real facilities as really helpful in applying the new skills. It&apos;s all really well-planned to use what you learned in the formal training and then almost immediately applying it in your internship time. \\n \\n3) INTERACTION WITH/AMONG STUDENTS. I had a wonderful time making new friends and feeling like a team with my classmates. We had a feeling somewhat like &apos;we&apos;re in this together&apos; and we helped each other to prepare for tests and the final certification test. My friendships and connections were one of the unanticipated &apos;benefits&apos; in the training with my peers. \\n\\n4) PREPARATION FOR STATE CERTIFICATION EXAM (at the Red Cross). Within my class 100% of the students passed the state exam, which says something about the level of training and preparation I/we received at Bradford.  Bradford staff provided support that greatly helped in preparing for the exam. I&apos;m not sure if this is an official policy but it certainly showed the people of Bradford really cared for the success of its students. Additionally, I and others received information from the instructors that helped us connect with potential job opportunities, and they provided very good advice on this as well as other career path options after the CNA. There are quite a few opportunities out there and the Bradford staff helped in guiding me to the right employer. So, overall, there&apos;s the training and education, but also some good support and guidance from their staff.  \\n\\nIN-SUM\\nI don&apos;t really have anything to say that is negative or in need of significant improvement about the program. I have to confess, I really liked the staff and I want them to continue in their work because their program helped me. To me I made a conscious effort to look at all of the programs I was interested in, with the main factors being 1) will this training provide me with a path to get into aspects of nursing and human care, and 2) is this worth my investment of time and money? I was really conscious of picking a program that was credible in the industry, and that I wouldn&apos;t just be paying for a certification that has no path to a job/career. After a month out of the course most if not all of the students I knew found jobs, so I feel the price and near assurance of a job in the field is a pretty good deal.",

I was extremely worried taking my ARC test but if anything they over prepared my for it and I passed on my first chance. I am now employed and I only started this journey in March. The environment is great as long as you are respectful and care about your future. If you want to make that first step to change your future do it here. When people ask me about being a cna and what I did to become one (it has happened a lot in the past few weeks) I always give the credit to the amazing staff at Bradford! Thank you Erika Edwin and Mrs. Milva because of your support I am now on the beginning of my journey into the health care industry!",

It&apos;s mostly common sense. \\nIt is family-run, but that&apos;s what I really liked about the facility.

The administrator Edwin is so friendly and helpfull he answered all my questions and helped me understand how the course works. Mrs Melva is very strict and old school teacher. This also means that she is very good at what she does. Sometimes she teaches even more then what you need to know for ARC. Dont let that overwhelm you just soak it all in. Also if you plan on continuing on and oursue a nursing degree alot of the way melva teaches sill help you prepare for that... I graduated in february and passed my Arc the first time in march... I am already working as a cna and so many of the extra things that melva taught us are things that i use everyday. I am glad i chose this school and you should too.",

Edwin and Erica also run the program amazingly, are great at communicating what exactly is going on like if we&apos;re not having class a certain day or if we&apos;re starting late. Erica is also awesome at helping teaching skills. She&apos;s so relaxed and teaches you in a way where you don&apos;t feel pressured, but remember exactly what you need to be doing. She also is super positive and helpful and willing to help you practice as many times as needed until you&apos;re comfortable with a skill.

My ultimate goal is to become an RN but I know that I had to have a stepping stone to start off my career I called multiple CNA schools around Stockton and half of them I couldn&apos;t understand over the phone!!!! That made me think how I was going to understand them in school, if I couldn&apos;t understand them over the phone??? It made me nervous!!! I called Bradford and Edwin, the Administrator was very polite and answered every question I had! (And I actually understood him) I asked a million questions! Like....when the program started, what times were the classes, if they were flexible on payments, how much the program cost, and if they had home health aide classes to offer. (THEY DO) Keep in mind that I  had called around and none of the other schools would give me this information over the phone for whatever reason, not only did he answer all my questions but my fiance&apos;s as well. My fiance and I are very critical about schools as I have had trouble getting into an LVN School because of the attitude of the staff this was no where near anything like that! Edwin was very informative, encouraging, and super supportive! My fiance was blown away by him the first time that they spoke in person! That&apos;s very hard to do as my fiance is also a manager of an assisted living, and has dealt with many kinds people. He liked Edwin very much and we were sold! I gave my deposit and started school within 2 weeks. I didn&apos;t know what to expect as I was nervous and it was my first time back in school after so many years. Make sure to bring lots of binder paper, a pencil or pen, and be on time!!! As you will be taking A LOT of notes during theory!! To be honest at first I was kind of scared of Milva (she&apos;s our teacher, Edwins Mom, and an RN). She seemed very\u00a0 strict and super sassy, within the next 2 days that went away! She&apos;s absolutely great , funny, she made the class go by super fast and always had the answers to our questions. Please pay attention in class!!! Study your notes and you&apos;ll pass your chapter test no problem!!\u00a0 Thank you Milva for everything! Because of your teachings I felt 100% confident while taking my ARC written exam! I Passed!!! Woo hoo!! NOW FOR SKILLS!!! (scary I know) You do Clinicals of course!! Almost every weekend of the program! (Sorry no going out anymore because you&apos;ll be tired) besides clinicals you do skills at school as well and that&apos;s when we met Erica! (Edwins Wife) She&apos;s just lovely! She is so calm, down to earth, and will help you with everything you need as well! She became our instant friend! She helped us so much and would always ask us to tell her if we needed her to repeat a certain skill. She&apos;s awesome! Thank you Erica for your expertise it helped me during my skill part of my ARC and I passed!!! Overall my experience has been nothing but great with them and I appreciate everyone there!!! I&apos;m currently attending their HHA class (:",

It&apos;s a small investment to see if you even want to get started in the nursing field/if nursing is for you(provided that is your long term goal). It felt like a very homely environment and I loved attending classes here. They even brought us treats during class a couple times!(popscicles on a hot day are more than welcomed)Truth be told the six weeks flew by way to soon and I already miss it all.

I am currently taking my prerequisites for nursing school, but decided that I wanted to get my CNA certification in order to get a bit of hands on experience while I&apos;m finishing my studies.  Milva, Erica and Edwin were all fantastic.  Milva is strict, yes, but she makes sure you know your stuff.  She has a sense of humor that comes out as she gets to know the class, which I enjoyed.  Edwin and Erica were very friendly and helpful in answering questions about the whole process.  They both go above and beyond and take a personal interest in each of the students.  Erica was very helpful with practicing skills in class.  It sounds a bit corny, but at the end of the 6 weeks we felt like family.  At the end of the course I felt confident going into both the written and practical exams.  About a week after I received my certification, I was offered a position as a CNA in a local nursing facility, and I am excited to be beginning my journey into the healthcare field.  After I eventually get my RN license, I will for sure be contacting them about their new RN-BSN program.",

The teacher though genuine about her feeling towards the elderly is definitely too old to keep up with the class demanding curriculum. She left us hanging in the course for a whole week and went on vacation. The teachings, equipment and exam system are outdated, limited and definitely do not stand the challenge of the course. The class is taught only through videos that do not even match the American Red Cross requirements. So, you watch something on video and  is expected to practice in a totally different way. The teacher is overwhelmed trying to teach the class and if you are left behind well too bad for you. 4 weeks in the program we still have not finished the curriculum and have practiced only 8 skills out of 25 ARC skills. Our clinical practice is non existent up to now and the RN has already  signed off our CDPH 283B for the requirement of the 150hrs of training. What a scam!\\n\\nBesides, this place is family run. Sometimes I feel I am in a daycare since the son and his wife always bring their 2years old daughter to the school. If you are attending this school be ready to deal with a constant screaming child, disruption from the administration since they are trying to get their jobs done over the learning of the students, out dated information, overcrowded class, every element needed to fail the state test.",

If you are a minority, specifically a Black person, you and your child would not be treated like other races. Their rules are broken for &quot;non-Blacks&quot; but a Black person is expected to follow them at all times. You and your child would be made to feel uncomfortable and bringing the issue to the staff only makes you feel more ostracized. I have been strongly considering sending my daughter back to public school. They claim to be more advanced in their studies than a public school, but my daughter is reading a book that she read in Public School three years ago. I am so disappointed in myself for choosing this school. The way that I feel treated by them is not against the law, but I do feel that it is a moral issue. Is this really the Catholic faith?",

The school has a new principal who is clearly committed to fostering an environment of exceptional academic quality and a commitment to teaching kids about their beautiful Catholic faith. \\n\\nNow, I dont know if this is just because it is a Catholic school or what, but it is sooo CLEAR that the teachers INVEST themselves into the children there. I&apos;d be willing to bet the public school children do not receive the same amount of attention and love and understanding and CARE that this school gives to it&apos;s children- regardless of whether or not they are Catholic, or if they are a child with &quot;Special needs&quot; or whatever. This school loves it&apos;s children, it is so clear. \\n\\nThis school is absolutely on the up and up - you can see it in their rapidly growing enrollement numbers.",

The students are taught to respect others and take responsibility for their actions in addition to the school&apos;s demanding and curriculum. \\n\\nI am shocked that a previous reviewer said that the staff isn&apos;t willing to work with children with special needs.

            "description": "This school year (2013), we have two children enrolled in St John the Evangelist.  One is in first grade and the other is in kindergarten.  There were a few major factors that played a role in our decision to choose St John the Evangelist:\\n\\n   1) Class size:  Last year, our son&apos;s kindergarten class was the first year they split into two classes instead of a single class and it helped in making class sizes that were already comparatively small, even smaller.  The amount of attention each individual student receives is incredible!\\n\\n    2) The Principal was a delight in our interview process and has been an administrator and teacher in Catholic Schools for quite some time.  She personally gave us a tour of the school, invited us to sit in classrooms to examine teaching styles (we visited multiple grades, not just the kindergarten).\\nShe is determined to get the best out of her staff and our children each day.  She is extremely approachable and available to us, as parents, with any questions we have.\\n\\n    3) Our family&apos;s Catholic faith was a big reason in choosing to educate our children through SJE.  It is truly inspiring to see our children grow in mind, body, and spirit simultaneously.  We are truly grateful that our Catholic Tradition is integrated in their educational upbringing. \\n\\nOne of the many success stories that we have with our son from last school year is that he was already reading beginner books by himself after just a couple of months of Kindergarten.  I couldn&apos;t believe my ears when he started reading to me; it concreted our decision even further.\\n\\nNow that we are armed with our own experiences of St John the Evangelist, we wouldn&apos;t hesitate doing this all over again.  We highly recommend anyone considering a private education in the area to put SJE on their short list of institutions for consideration.   It is a blessing to know our children are getting the best of what the teachers and administrators have to offer every day.",

The school has created a wonderful community, strong in faith and community service! We love all the extra things they offer to enhance their learning experience such as Grandparent&apos;s Day, Daddy Daughter Dance, weekly all-school masses, Candy Bar Bingo, Skating Parties, etc. It&apos;s a wonderful place for our children to grow up. We are so happy with our decision and are grateful to the caring staff who go above and beyond for our daughters&apos; needs!",

They prefer to label them as &quot;bad&quot; children and exclude them from class activities.

She left upset and then they talked about her after she left. \\n\\nThey were also rude to my mother who was trying to care for my son while I looked at fabric.

The staff was so nice and accommodating that it felt like we were talking with friends. We just wanted to stay and hang out with them. You just can&apos;t help but be inspired by all the samples, displays and special touches. An example are the bags that are used for purchases. They are made from vintage quilt magazine pages that have been transferred onto plastic sheets and sewn together on a sewing machine!  Smaller items are tucked into old pattern envelopes!  It&apos;s these special little touches that make it the most charming shopping experience. I highly recommend making a trek to see this gem of a shop.",

I recently moved down this way from the Bay Area and have to find a new place to spend my money for such stuff.  I was going to do a t-shirt quilt so I went up to the store and bought some amazing stabilizer that Dana recommended.  Once I had the quilt completed I took it back up there to have it quilted on the longarm.  Turned it in on December 30th, they called on January 2nd that it was ready for pickup!  So fast I could not get up there soon enough to see it.  They did a fantastic job and allowed me to use the big table in the backroom to trim it up thus saving me the back breaking task of doing it on my dining room table.  The quilt looks great and I will be bringing others to them to quilt after I buy more fabric.",

Although I don&apos;t understand the store&apos;s policy that the minimum amount of fabric you can purchase is 1/2 yard, what really irked me was the fact that that policy wasn&apos;t posted anywhere in the shop. I travel extensively throughout North America and make it a point to visit quilt shops wherever I am and I&apos;ve never come across this type of store policy! If the owners of Creation Station feel it&apos;s  OK to blind side customers like that, this is not a store that I&apos;ll do business with so I&apos;ll not be darkening the doors of this store again!",

The retreats start Friday morning at 8:00AM and go until Sunday afternoon at 3:00.  Some people stay late into the night, while others arrive early in the morning, sometimes overlapping!  With a full service quilt shop next door, it&apos;s easy to pick up last minute items.  The owners, an energetic young couple, make sure that the retreat attendees have everything they need for a rewarding weekend.\\nI highly recommend the Brown Bag retreats!",

The school allows all students into the program that met requirements but then a semester later many student are removed from program and are not given a second chance to come back. I spoke with a teacher and off the record she told me that the school is looking for &quot;higher quality nurses&quot; which meant anyone with tattoos or a questionable life styles were no longer desired. They kick these people out for poor reasons and then deny there attempt to re enter the program. Complete scam! Dean Summer Warner is a big part of the problem",

My only difficulty I had here was I&apos;m from Ogden and the commute was really difficult.

I went there to look into the nursing program I already have a college degree.  Garret, the admissions counselor seemed like a low level salesman. I think that people should be careful of this place it seems that the admissions counselor is trained to get you to sign up at any cost even if he had to lie and deny it later.  \\n\\nGarret in particular seemed to get frustrated when I asked him a question that deviated from his crappy sales script he memorized. I felt that he was incapable of leveling with me in terms of how long the program would be with all the classes I wanted to transfer in. He gave me 2 different answers on both meetings with him and he denied what he said which is interesting because I wrote it down. He also bashed other schools in the area that are accredited which is unprofessional and just lame! \\n\\nI don&apos;t think this is the right place to go if you are transferring or are an older student. I think this place is designed to get students fresh out of high school but I would still pay attention to the costs etc. don&apos;t trust the sales/admissions people. \\n\\nAfter some more research and speaking to other people in the area, I found that my experience was consistent with other people. The reviews on this place are bad for a reason.  Thank God I figured this out before I wasted anymore time. I wish anyone who reads this the best of luck on your education journey. \\n\\nAnd if there is someone from the college who reads this. I&apos;m sure you can find admissions counselors who care about helping people.",

The facility members are fantastic and are always available to help outside of class time. The program/school as a whole is rather small, but that only adds to the learning experience, as each student can have the one on one teaching that is required and you never feel like you are forgotten or being left behind. Would recommend Provo College to anyone interested in being a Physical Therapist Assistant.",

You have to &quot;request information&quot; to get any basic questions answered and my informer Trevor, didn&apos;t seem to have any idea what he was talking about. I was trying to see if provo college would accept most of my credits from a previous university I&apos;d been at for a year. Trevor asked me to send pictures of my class schedules so he could help me figure out what would transfer, turns out he had no idea and instead of responding with anything helpful he through me a pitch of &quot;well the real question is whether or not you want to finish school faster.&quot; I was looking for help not some crappy sales pitch. I decided to set up a meeting in person to see if someone else could help me and I was assigned to trevor again...bummer. He gave me a date and a few times to meet with him, but no place to meet him, when i texted to confirm what time I wanted and to double check where i was supposed to go he never responded. I am extremely disappointed in the service and how i was treated, you feel like you&apos;re being talked down to instead of having a normal conversation.

It was as if the only students they could attract were not personable, clueless to common sense, never used deodorant, and BARELY passed high school.\\nThen the instructors-wow! Most of them went to college at some point, but I only had one teacher for about 8 of my classes-He had to go and learn what he was about to teach us the day before class!!\\nAll those perks-all went away when they decided to fire the campus president at American Fork, hire some satan woman, then replace her with some dude that thinks smiling will cause cancer. I swear, he couldn&apos;t be nice if his daughter&apos;s life depended on it. He cut off usage of the gym to students, had little attendance cards like back in grade school, closes his door and locks it so no one could talk to him, fired the good employees that kept the students happy and productive, then changed the accrediting body of the campus which in turn changed requirements and costs for students.\\nHe also banned students children from EVER being on campus. That was a HUGE perk for students going to school at night because they worked during the day-saved them a ton on babysitters or driving to and from families homes where the children now have to stay.\\nAnd the cherry on top, most of us are not rich, so we can&apos;t afford a huge commute, that&apos;s why we chose this campus right near home, and now they&apos;re closing down the campus and making us choose to either drop out of school, or drive a light year difference between the campuses. To some, it might not be that much, but to us barely surviving as it is, it&apos;s a huge cost! And to try to drive that much more, make it to our job on time, and make it to school on time so we don&apos;t get in trouble, is now almost impossible!\\nIF YOU CARE ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR FUTURE, FIND ANY OTHER SCHOOL! PROVO COLLEGE WILL PUT YOU IN HUGE DEBT, AND THE EDUCATION YOU RECEIVE SUCKS VERY, VERY BADLY! You will not be prepared to work in the area you are studying for. You&apos;re better using your gut instinct rather than the &quot;education&quot; they have to offer.",

All the teachers are standing at their door with a student leader to great each child with a verbal welcome and a handshake before entering the room. They start the kids day by treating them as little adults, empowering them to behave as such. \\n\\nThe school goals and standards are posted everywhere, along with how they are doing in regard to those goals and standards. They set high standards of their teaches and the kids as well. \\n\\nThey focus on the 7 Habits of Highly Successful People written, coached and practiced in ways that the kids understand.

They are able to have outdoor activities, team building activities and projects done multiple times during the week. My daughter is learning more about colors, numbers, animals...etc. She is being taught at an early age what a routine is. What it is like to be &quot;at school&quot;. The updates throughout the day I get as a parent, are so comforting. I know they are taking care of my child. I have and will continue to recommend them to any and all friends and family looking into daycare centers!",

The lesson plans they prepare keep my kids engaged and excited to learn new things. They are constantly bringing home little projects that were fun, and actually taught a lesson.

            "description": "Finally made it to this quaint, historic church just a few blocks walk from downtown Solvang! This church, still a parish church, was founded in 1912 upon a vote of the new residents of what would become Solvang. Originally meeting in the small local hotel, and then Atterdag College, the congregation finally built this structure in 1928. The church is open daily, and there is a wonderful brochure in the vestibule which highlights the features of this small, beautiful church. The main attraction, at least for me, is the woodwork around the sanctuary. Hand worked by artisan Jes Smidt. He carved the altar, altar railing, pastor&apos;s chairs, pulpit and baptismal font. All are amazingly simple yet deeply beautiful, especially the pulpit, with its 3-D statues (St. John, St. Peter, St. Paul and St. Ansgar) carved into (out of?!) the wood. Take a close look at their features and you&apos;ll be very impressed with Mr. Smidt&apos;s skills. Other features in the church include bright and symbolic contemporary stained glass windows in the sanctuary, and an old sailing ship hanging from the ceiling. Yep, that caught my attention! Seems the Vikings, according to the brochure, view the &quot;church as a ship that takes people safely through the storms of life.&quot; To hang a model of a ship reminds the Danish of this, and this haven of safety, the church, in their lives. Beautiful tradition! The last amazing feature of this seemingly simple church is the Phelps pipe organ, a commanding presence in the choir loft. Installed in 1981 after years of fundraising, this organ boasts 20 ranks of pipes, totaling 1,024 pipes. Would love to hear it someday! For historical reasons alone, this church is a place to visit, reflecting the cultural and faith history of the original Danish settlers; yet, it exudes a life and warmth today, as signs of an active faith life still are present in your visit. Come, and spend a little time in this small safe haven in Solvang!",

She gives great lesson plans. She pointed out my errors and helped me correct them. We did a mock drive test at the dmv where she graded me and scored me as if it was a real test.

He only had turned 4 in a class with 5 and almost 6 year olds. Now he&apos;s 2nd grade with no issues with behavior in school and is top of the class in nearly all subjects.

They offer makeup classes if they miss for some reason, but depending on what time you have your normal class it is almost impossible to get into one, they only allow a certain amount in the makeup class so if there are too many when you can go it&apos;s too bad for you. My wife called and one person was super nice and tried to help her, another called her back and was rude and unprofessional. My wife is the sweetest person alive and will go out of her way for anyone, and they treat her like that? Way to lose business and give me the motivation to leave this review! They need to make it just as easy to go to a makeup class regardless of the time you have your normal class. They schedule the makeups during normal class times, how does that make any sense? We spend a lot of money so our child can go to gymnastics... Life happens and sometimes people miss their class, but let&apos;s not screw people out of their money! We won&apos;t be signing up at this place again!",

I wanted to understand how my designs would be built and be able to communicate with the development teams I worked with. After a few weeks of DevMoutain I was able to more effectively communicate with the development teams and better understand what could and couldn&apos;t be feasibly built. My designs got better and I gained confidence in myself as we built our individual projects each week in class. DevMountain gets you coding from week 1 in front end and backend technologies, so you understand how web applications work and have experience doing it all. They give you the tools to decide which area of development you&apos;re good at and enjoy, so you can make a career decision and pursue it. It was awesome. Every night we wrote code with teachers and mentors to help us when we got stuck, giving you context that online tutorials can&apos;t match. I had a great experience and made friendships and connections that benefit me now and will in the future. Can&apos;t recommend these guys enough.",

It taught my kids if they were bad they could go home. The director would put no blame on the teacher and had me take my kids to the doctor to find out nothing was wrong with them. Ultimatly they were terminated. I do not recommend you put your children in the care of these people.",

This place is too small for the number of kids in there and not enough staff members that actually want to be there. Kids Plus has had the same teachers and helpers for the past 5 years. It was a different person every other day. When I saw the review from the previous parent, it was so similar to my experience that I had to write about mine. To respond with You don&apos;t remember is the same answers I always got when I questioned the way things were being done at this place. I was very disappointed and have noticed a pattern they tend to make. Telling parents to come pick up their child cause they are sick when in fact they are not, gives them 2 days automatically out of the week to not have to care for your child. After Making weekly doctor visits and paying a copay amount each visit, just to give an excuse to the daycare to prove your child is not sick will start to add up and also cause a strain at work. So there you have it to why I placed my review about your company.",

I wish I hadn&apos;t the pilot didn&apos;t say a word to us when we got in which made it kind of awkward in my opinion. My 7 year old daughter sat in the front with him she was so excited it was her first time flying and it was a surprise birthday present for her. I&apos;ve went on a helicopter ride down here a few years ago and it was great the guy talked to us the whole time asked where we were staying so we could fly by and wave I&apos;ll be taking her there if we ever want to go again. When we got done she was like why didn&apos;t he say hi how are you or bye have a nice day i hope you enjoyed it when we got out that was awkward. i asked which way we were going and he told me left down the beach and across state park and thats the only thing he ever said. The lady that walks you to the helicopter was super nice and friendly.  Luckily my daughter still enjoyed it and it wasn&apos;t a total bust for her.",

The pilot (is adorable) is knowledgeable, gives competent instructions without terrifying you, then lifts you off of the tarmac before you can start to panic about being hoisted 500 feet off terra firma in a glass bubble glued to a beer can.  The panic lasts only a couple seconds, then ... OMG.  Just.  Wow.  It&apos;s a short trip around the Gulf Shores city, beach and state park.  The pilot loves his little neck of the woods and ADORES his machine.  He is happy to share info and explain intricacies of his aircraft.  And ...  drumroll .... you get to wear those cool headphones with microphones attached.  Do this tourist thing.  Its fun to go hang around the airport, too.  \\n\\nAFTERTHOUGHT:  It is not, in fact, a beer can.  It&apos;s an amazing, well-kept, well-loved flying machine.

I wish they went up to 8th grade so we could stay there but it only goes up to 5th! They have amazing security: you have to be buzzed in through the front office and all the doors and fences are locked from the outside. You also have to scan you Driver License into the system which is great for deterring criminals and parents that aren&apos;t allowed to see their children for custody purposes. The principal will always email you back and the two women in the office are so friendly and amazing!!",

The studio fosters such a great unity among the dancers and we love that our daughter is learning technique as she dances.  She has so much fun and loves her teachers to pieces.  It has been amazing to see her grow as a dancer and how much she has learned, especially during the summer.  We love that Steps&apos; offers dance, tumbling, and private lessons too!  Recitals are always so much fun.  I love that they perform twice a year, rather than once, and competitions are exciting too!  Our daughter loves to be on stage and perform and the teachers have helped foster her confidence, and to believe in herself.  She especially loves when they choreograph a new trick she has learned into a dance for her to perform.  They are so great, and we highly recommend them!",

It&apos;s been amazing how much their confidence and performance abilities have grown in such a short time.  Steps offers so many different classes that my girls can take everything they wanted in one studio instead of having to drive from one place to another.   Steps has also helped them excel in competition, which is something they&apos;ve been wanting to do for a long time. My girls are quite excited to be involved in the Stadium of Fire this year also.

            "description": "Sunday, March 9th, Tony and I was driving back to Nashville from Birmingham and I chose a road route via Talladega so I could check out their historical buildings.\\n\\n I didn&apos;t know that there was this historical college here so I was very pleased and in awe of some of the gorgeous buildings that made up the campus of this old college.\\n \\nEven though there is Security Alert sign about 24 hr protection...No ONE stopped us. I enjoyed this college because of all the old buildings. When in the area, you should stop by and check it out.\\n\\nHistory:\\nTalladega College, located in Talladega, Alabama, is a private, liberal arts college. It holds the distinction as Alabama&apos;s oldest private historically black college. As of 2009 the school received full SACS accreditation\\nThe history of Talladega College began on November 20, 1865, when two former slaves William Savery and Thomas Tarrant, both of Talladega, met in convention with a group of new freedmen in Mobile, Alabama. From this meeting came the commitment, &quot;...We regard the education of our children and youth as vital to the preservation of our liberties, and true religion as the foundation of all real virtue, and shall use our utmost endeavors to promote these blessings in our common country.&quot;\\nWith this as their pledge, Savery and Tarrant, aided by General Wager Swayne of the Freedmen&apos;s Bureau, began in earnest to provide a school for the children of former slaves of the community. Their leadership resulted in the construction of a one-room school house using lumber salvaged from an abandoned carpenter&apos;s shop. The school overflowed with pupils from its opening and soon it was necessary to move into larger quarters.\\nMeanwhile, the nearby Baptist Academy was about to be sold under mortgage default. This building had been built in 1852-53 with the help of slaves - including Savery and Tarrant. A speedy plea was sent to General Swayne for its purchase. General Swayne in turn persuaded the American Missionary Association to buy the building and some 20 acres (81,000 m2) of land for $23,000.\\nThe grateful parents renamed the building Swayne School and it opened in November 1867 with about 140 pupils. A building constructed before the war with slave labor for white students became the home of the state&apos;s first college dedicated to serving the educational needs of blacks. In 1869, Swayne School was issued a charter as Talladega College by the Judge of Probate of Talladega County.\\nThe former Baptists Academy building, now known as Swayne Hall, has remained in service as the symbol and spirit of the beginning of the college.\\n\\nAndrews Hall, built in 1910, houses the Music Department and the Education Department. It is named for George Whitfield Andrews, D.D., Dean of Theological Department from 1875 to 1908.\\nArthur D. Shores Hall, constructed in 1974, is named for the late Attorney Arthur D. Shores, Class of 1927, who served for many years as a member and chairman of the College Board of Trustees.\\nDe Forest Chapel, built in 1903 in commemoration of the life and service of the Rev. Henry Swift De Forest, D.D., President of the College from 1879 to 1896. DeForest Chapel was renovated in 1996 and rededicated November 1996. De Forest was the father of inventor Lee De Forest.\\nFanning Refectory, built in 1928 from a legacy of Dr. David H. Fanning of Worcester, Massachusetts. The building contains the student and faculty dining rooms.\\nJuliette Derricotte House, built in 1940-41, was the gift of the Harkness Foundation and named for Juliette Derricotte, Class of 1918, who at the time of her death in 1932 was a member of the Board of Trustees. Formerly a staff residence and guest house, it was converted into a women&apos;s honors dormitory in 1988.\\nSilsby Science Hall, constructed in 1926, was named for Dr. E. C. Silsby,[2] who was a member of the College faculty for 37 years. The building was a gift of the General Education Board and friends and alumni of the College. It contains the laboratories and classrooms for the Natural Sciences and Mathematics.",

The history that comes with its beauty is what I truly loved.\\n\\nYou can visit the George Washington Carver Museum, tour the home Booker T. Washington built and visit the burial site of him and his family along with other historic burial sites..all of which are located in the heart of campus. I recommend you see everything!\\n\\nThe university was oddly very quiet. Which left us to assume that the students were in their dorms feverishly studying. \\n\\nMake sure to visit the Tuskegee Airmen National Museum on your way into campus (crawford st.)  it&apos;s simply amazing to see and read about the young airmen. Emotional to say the least.",

Many of the buildings on the historic campus were built with the assistance of students.  \\n\\nLocated in a small town, the campus maintains a conference center that includes lodging and restaurant facilities for visitors.  My visit to the campus was enjoyable as everyone was friendly, pleasant and welcoming. \\n\\nSome of the many interesting sites to visit on campus include the George Washington Carver Museum, the National Center for Bioethics in Research and Health Care, and the grave sites for Dr. Booker T. Washington and Dr. George Washington Carver. You should reserve time to visit the museums to learn more about the contributions this institution made to this country.",

These ppl truly have your interests and goals at heart and pushes you to your full potential. However the administration is another thing. As with any institution you expect to have bumps and road blocks, but the workers in the Financial Aid and the Bursar&apos;s office are HORRIBLE! I dread having to go in either office. They are rude, they talk down to you, and they&apos;re unwiling to help you, explain, or clear up any misunderstandings. They never answer the phones (and I&apos;ve seen them ignore the phone while I was waiting in line). And they just have bad attitudes. \\nPaperwork is always missing and it never fails, something always comes up at the end of the semester where you end up having to pay some fee that mysteriously wasn&apos;t covered or paid at the beginning of the semester. I can go on.\\nBut despite those few problems the university is fine. \\n\\nThe things we put up with to be a Tuskegee Alum!",

The guidance and leadership for helping our son choose his courses were excellent and he was able to get the class schedule he needed for his major.  The campus is beautiful and clean!  It is a smoke free campus and they have great security on site.  There are so many support systems for the students and the dorms are top rated in the United States.  \\n\\nThe bookstore and food services were impressive!  So many good food options and lots of great clothing and swag to purchase.  \\n\\nOverall the campus is a beautiful walk and bike friendly area with great green spaces and wonderful classroom and housing facilities.

Going to this campus for a football game is a religious experience, Alabama fans were also super nice to me for some reason but I am a pretty easy going mild mannered guy now a days. I really like the students at U. of Alabama especially the lovely females they have. Very outgoing, bubbly and welcoming students they have here. I would recommend a visit its an awesome place to be in the Fall. T Town is almost title town for the Alabama football team they have won 4 titles in the past 7 years. I will be back to visit the campus really soon I love it.",

            "description": "This is a great state university.  I did research on many schools, and if you get admitted here you are lucky. The hard part is the cost.  UA is about 25K for in state students. Out of state is 33K. Four years here could really be a huge investment.  \\nIf you are part of the Greek system, add even more.  I went to UT Austin 30 yrs. ago, and Ohio State Univ.  in the 70s.  Both schools were affordable at that time for state residents. Too many state universities today are easily 2000/month.  Unless you get grants or some assistance, you will go heavily into debt to be here.  The job mkt. may or may not be great when you finish, so factor that in also.  I don&apos;t think many students realize how long it takes to pay back loans of 20K or more.  You will have a tough load to carry long after you leave campus.  My advice is try to do your first two years at a cheaper school, become a transfer student for your final two years. Otherwise prepare for sticker shock. The student body at UA is diverse, friendly, and affluent. Over 50% of incoming freshman are from out of state. I&apos;m 60 now, and if I could start again, UA would be a great choice once you work out the financial picture. Do that before you apply, or you might be very unhappy later. Employers don&apos;t care much about your alma mater. They care about what economic value you bring to the table. The social life here can&apos;t be beat. Sadly that won&apos;t count once you enter the job market. Don&apos;t  pay too much just to party!  Good luck!",

            "description": "(for my DC friends.... Al-a-ba-ma Roll Tide Roll.  you knew this was coming eventually...)\\n\\n5.0 stars.  I find it shocking that no one has reviewed my undergraduate alma mater.  In fact, I am almost certain that is impossible so hopefully someone will take the good service to let me know the appropriate place for this review.  \\n\\nWith that said....\\n\\nI&apos;m biased.  I have gone to the University of Texas for law school and George Washington for business school.  I have taken classes at Southern Miss and South Alabama.  I have taught at Georgetown, Howard, and Maryland.  Through my legal work and propensity to watch an inordinate amount of college football, I have visited a number of other universities.  Nothing comes close to the experience that is the University of Alabama.  \\n\\n(Yes, UVA people.  That includes your school.)\\n\\nWhat is it about the University of Alabama that separates it from other schools?  First and foremost, the facilities at the business school were top notch when I was a student here eons ago.  I think any student orientation should start and end at the Culverhouse School to give prospectives a strong understanding of the modern technology that ALABAMA has invested in to make your learning experience one that actually has functionality in today&apos;s society.  Second, the university is ridiculously cheap.  To put it bluntly, Alabama&apos;s tuition is cheaper than my high school&apos;s tuition.  From an objective perspective, the Alabama degree is certainly more impressive.  Third, I had amazing career options after finishing up at Alabama.  I turned down Merrill Lynch in New York to go to law school.  I had offers from undergraudate school that put the offers I received after law school to shame (note that Texas was ranked in the top 15 by US News and World Report for law school; Alabama&apos;s undergraduate programs generally are not given such a high mark).  Indeed, one could say that I was very well positioned straight out of college for a ridiculously lucrative and rewarding career.  Isn&apos;t that the whole point of going to college?  To position yourself for future success?\\n\\nOh wait.  College football.  You wanted to hear about college football.  Yeah, we play a little bit of pigskin down south.  ALABAMA is the best college football program in the country.  National championships are bred here faster than what goes on between two happy rabbits in a sock.  With Nick Saban adding his own chapter to our glorious past, it is only a matter of time before another national championship banner finds its way to Tuscaloosa.\\n\\nOther useful items:  beautiful campus, impressive Greek life, great BBQ, social students, and caring faculty.  I&apos;m not going to engage in utter hyperbole and say that it&apos;s the greatest experience ever, but I think one would be hard pressed to find a school located in the Deep South that better prepares a young mind for success on a regional playing field at such an attractive price point.  Check out the University of Alabama.  You might be surprised by what you find.",

When we got there, there was no one at the front desk and we waited and after no one acknowledged us, I stepped into the common area. We were greeted (and i use that term loosley) by the someone who I later found out was the owner. She was not happy that we were there and she was not pleasant. She stated that she didn&apos;t schedule appointments, only walk ins.... so whoever answers the phone and the owner apparently didn&apos;t communicate that we were coming. Needless to say, if you have a 18 month old.... she won&apos;t have an availability  until December ( which is what I was told). She did motion for and say &quot;just come on&quot; but from her demeanor I was over her and we left. \\nI&apos;m not sure if she just has terrible customer service or if she was having a bad day or of she was annoyed with her worker for scheduling our appointment,  there is a way to handle people appropriately and she did not",

            "description": "Where do I begin? My daughter was five months old when we left this facility and at that time in her short life she had been sick more than she was healthy. I understand that babies get sick, but she became ill with things that infants shouldn&apos;t be exposed to on a regular basis. She had several stomach viruses, pink eye (twice!), a bad ear infection due to bottle propping, and severe nasal congestion which lasted three months and resulted in two emergency trips to both the Children&apos;s hospital and the Children&apos;s outpatient center. Several times, I left her pacifier at home and found that they use daycare pacifiers (which is not sanitary whatsoever)! Even after informing them that my daughter should sleep in an inclined position on her back, I would walk in and find her asleep on her stomach in a crib. She does not normally sleep in this position and hates being on her stomach, so it made me wonder how long she screamed before she finally passed out. I rated this facility with two stars because all of the teachers really do seem to care for her and she enjoyed seeing them every day. The teachers would not ever share my requests about my daughter&apos;s care with one another. One thing that I wish they had done more of is allow my child to play. Because she was one of the littlest children in the baby room, she was often unable to play and learn new skills because the older babies would be allowed to run her over. She never received time to use the toys or exersaucers in the room because of this. If she wasn&apos;t being fed, she was in a bouncy seat or a swing. Once most of the older babies reached a certain age, both a television and a VCR were brought into the classroom. The children were placed in their chairs at the feeding table to watch movies. These are children who are under a year old, being held in a chair to watch television! During our last two days at this facility, the workers finally allowed my daughter to play with some of the toys in the room. They allowed her to play with a kick and play gym. When I told them that she would probably prefer something for a child who could sit they told me they were unaware that she could sit on her own. How can you spend 8-9 hours with my child for five days a week and not realize that she&apos;s been able to sit up on her own for about three weeks now? This facility is considered a church run facility and therefore does not have to follow the rules stated in the Minimum Standards for Daycare Facilities Regulations and Procedures for the state of Alabama. I walked in once and heard a teacher screaming at the top of her lungs at a child in the two year old classroom. I grabbed my daughter and just bolted out the door. I am not sure how the children are treated in older children&apos;s classrooms on a regular basis, but if they treat their babies (who cannot speak for themselves) this way, you should wonder about how your child may be treated.",

We LOVE the teachers and staff here, but I&apos;ll keep my review brief:\\n\\n1. classrooms are big, bright, sunny, and clean.\\n2. New playgrounds, with separate play areas for bigs and littles.\\n3. shaded,  smaller play area that is just for toddlers.\\n4. Plenty of caretakers, and classes are always properly attended (we had an issue with this at another care provider).\\n5. Large, indoor gym for play during inclement weather.\\n6. Well-planned, developmentally appropriate lessons, lots of fun activities that my little loves. \\n7. Did I mention that the staff is caring, warm, open, and communicative? \\n8. School is organized and efficiently run.\\n9. Lunch is lunch - no organics or vegetarian options, but otherwise satisfactory, a lot like public school menus. Haven&apos;t had any complaints from my little about the food. \\n\\nFor Secular moms: The curriculum is definitely Christian, and students attend a brief chapel service every morning, so expect your little to come home singing &quot;god songs&quot; and talking about Jesus. Religious messages are prominent in every classroom (as one would expect in a church-sponsored school).",

This is the first review that I have ever written in my life about anything. It breaks my heart from the last review I read and I cannot look away without writing something. From the school, kids, teaching staff I have NEVER had any bad experiences and the love of Christ is definitely in this place. The kids are taught to love each other as the Bible teaches us to love. The staff loves the kids and respect them as though they love their own. Besides from the administrator down to the teaches ALL of their kids goes to school there as well. So if a school was this horrible and you&apos;re on the staff, and your colleagues and the environment was this toxic, would you let your child go there? Point given!!! So regardless of personal issues and I do pray for the individual that have inner issues that are not school related, but lets be fair and give honest reviews because there are others out there that needs the honest truth in helping them make the decision of a school choice for their child the same way someone helped us. Glad I made the choice years ago. The school is GREAT!!!  This is Fact!!",

            "description": "I would not recommend this music school.  The teacher was great, however there were issues with the owner&apos;s attitude when we withdrew. We withdrew due to the driving time being too much for us from Helena.  The owner was nice when our child was taking lessons but as soon as we withdrew he appeared ticked off and we ended up being charged for an extra month of lessons because he did not communicate to us, even though I asked him several times, if we were going to have to pay for two more months because I requested the withdrawal on the first of the month instead of the last day of the previous month. At first he told me that I would just be paying for the month I withdrew in, however when we saw money come out  the month after that and asked him why , we were told that it&apos;s because we didn&apos;t submit the request a month in advance.  By the time we realized the extra month of tuition had been taken our child had stopped going to lessons, because we thought he was done the month before that.  So we paid for a month that our child didn&apos;t even attend lessons in.  Be aware then, if you withdraw to get in writing the last day of lessons for your child and the last day that pymnt will be taken.\\nREPLY TO OWNERS COMMENTS: when someone tells you on the first day of the month that they will not be returning next month that is 30 days notice. count the days. it&apos;s a month. You are only interested in the money and not the students. It does not say in your policies that you must cancel the last day of the month, it says a month in advance. And even if your policy was to cancel on the very last day of the month and someone cancels on the first day of the month then I would think that you would be kind enough to give them a break, otherwise your business may get the reputation of being a place that&apos;s only concerned about taking more money from their students. it was poor customer service. Oh one more thing....I did fill out a withdrawal form in person and spoke to Russ, as i mentioned in the review. He told me I would only be charged for the tuition for that month but then he charged me for two months. there was nothing at all on the form stating when the last pymnt would be and when the last lesson would be.  I just had to say that I was giving my notice that my son would not be returning to lessons the following month.",

From her professional perspective and insights- to providing actionable and realistic goals and objectives- she is wonderful.\\n\\nAt the beginning of COVID-19, almost a year ago, I met Lisa at a local coffee shop. We chatted and I knew she was the perfect person for me. She is someone who you can be open, honest and authentic with and not feel any judgment. \\n\\nThe life lessons she has taught me I will carry throughout my entire life. My life has calmed, emotional and mentally, I am able to handle stress and life easier and apply my knowledge from Lisa to all situations. \\n\\nI oftentimes find myself saying, &quot;What would Lisa do/say?&quot; And in those moments, I find clarity and myself crushing those difficult or life moments. \\n\\nWithout Lisa, I am not sure what my life would be like, and she has 100 percent change it for the better. I have continued with her for a year, and without a doubt, we have learned so much from one another. \\n\\nIf you are unsure if life coaching is for you, everyone needs their person, and Lisa can be that person. You will not be disappointed. I recommend her to each and everyone who is searching for their outside person to speak to! Call her, it will be worth it!!",

When we were looking for childcare and early education options for our son, we knew MKU was our choice school upon witnessing first hand the method, the facilities, the teachers, and the diversity of the student body. As American Muslims raised in Alabama, navigating the intersectionality of our various identities was often challenging, and upon becoming parents, we wanted to ensure our son would be cared for in an environment that embraces each individual child and their unique attributes. The staff here is highly professional and caring. The facilities are clean and uncluttered. I&apos;m continually impressed by the activities that our now 14 month old partakes in: various fruit tastings, artwork, Spanish lessons, circle time, etc...So far, despite the expense (comparable to similar facilities in the area) we are so happy with our choice and eagerly look forward to our son&apos;s continued growth and development at this school/daycare.",

Washington built and visit the burial site of him and his family along with other historic burial sites..all of which are located in the heart of campus. I recommend you see everything!\\n\\nThe university was oddly very quiet. Which left us to assume that the students were in their dorms feverishly studying. \\n\\nMake sure to visit the Tuskegee Airmen National Museum on your way into campus (crawford st.)  it&apos;s simply amazing to see and read about the young airmen.

My visit to the campus was enjoyable as everyone was friendly, pleasant and welcoming. \\n\\nSome of the many interesting sites to visit on campus include the George Washington Carver Museum, the National Center for Bioethics in Research and Health Care, and the grave sites for Dr. Booker T.

They are rude, they talk down to you, and they&apos;re unwiling to help you, explain, or clear up any misunderstandings. They never answer the phones (and I&apos;ve seen them ignore the phone while I was waiting in line). And they just have bad attitudes. \\nPaperwork is always missing and it never fails, something always comes up at the end of the semester where you end up having to pay some fee that mysteriously wasn&apos;t covered or paid at the beginning of the semester.

Both are interesting and worth a visit, but not enough to depict Booker T.&apos;s impact on America and his central efforts to improve the lot of the recently emancipated populations in the South. Good effort, but there is more to be done to make the site a more impactful attraction and celebration of Washington.",
