(I will update my rating after school starts up again.)  So far I like that the kids can come at any time on any or all of the five days that it is open and can get one-on-one help with tutors for the entire 1 hour session if they want it.  I also like that at the end of each session a progress report for each kid is provided to the parent which tells what the kids worked on, what they have accomplished and what they need to work on.  The kids get instant rewards for completing session work to keep them motivated, and also earn &quot;cards&quot; they can save up and exchange for prizes in the future.\\n\\nThe facility is always clean and orderly, and the people who work there are friendly and helpful.  If you have more than one kid enrolled at a time there is a discount on the others.  The owner is very nice and works with the kids as well.",

The show is based on a story about a young married couple who unknowingly move into one of the most haunted houses in the country. The writing is truly brilliant as is the choreography, lighting and setup between sets. The way the dancing actors incorporate dance into a few scenes is also astounding. No spoilers, but this is a must see in Eureka Springs. This show will be going on until November I believe.

Raymond and Emma, founders of a dance studio that moved here from Colorado, have created seasonal performances in Eureka Springs before but this is the first time we have seen them and their acting/dancing crew. They now have a hit show and are letting local residents and vacationers alike see what they can do. And they can do much more than you can imagine!\\n\\nThe performance we attended was &apos;Anna.&apos;It is a performance that runs like a traditional three act play, presenting a young couple who just bought a large house on a huge piece of land. The house has a history, and the history slowly sinks its claws into the couple and their friends and family. I will say no more on the plot, but you are up close, inside the house from the opening scene, so prepare yourself. \\n\\nThe actors all live out these characters naturally and can bounce between eras in dress, voice and style in the flick of an eye. They are &quot;around&quot; the audience at times, making you feel more and more as if you&apos;re inside the house. They use light, and sound, and excellent special effects timing, to make you squirm as you begin to realize what&apos;s happening.  While it is not a musical, music figures strongly in, as does their expert dancing. This makes &apos;Anna&apos; like no other live stage performance we have seen, and we were blown away. The dancing feels natural because it is integral to the story and the transporting of the audience across time and into the heads of the characters.  You will love it. Well done, Raymond, Emma, and the rest of Melonlight! We will see this again if it is still playing on our next trip. And if you have something new, we&apos;ll be sure to see that! Thank you for creating something great in this lovely town.",

They didn&apos;t treat us as good customers, they treated us more as friends, and it was very much appreciated! Quality of instruction was amazing and as someone who can not dance (and knows it very well) and therefor is extremely self conscious, they helped me get over that in a hurry. I went from embarrassed to dance in front of my wife to doing the Thriller dance with their group in front of thousands of people in less than a week. If you get a chance and have ever even remotely thought of taking a dance class, you owe it to yourself to go by and take a lesson here.",

            "description": "Wine in Arkansas? I know what you&apos;re thinking... but hear me out. This is some award winning stuff! And they use their own local grapes (winning)! The tasting is no cost, and bottles are extremely reasonable. If you buy two bottles, you get a free wine glass. Wine is $6 by the glass.\\n\\nA big fan of wineries in Europe and South America (Italy, France, Chile, Spain, etc.), and my beloved Sonoma, you aren&apos;t going to get the same type of experience or aesthetic here. And at the time I went in, COVID was (is) still a concern, so the tasting was different than you&apos;d usually get - and disposable cups were used instead of glasses which would definitely allow for a better taste of the wine.\\n\\nNow, I am an equal opportunity wine drinker. I tend to gravitate more toward the reds, but it was the whites that were the show-stoppers for me here! \\n\\nOverall, with the reds, I found them to all taste more like &quot;light&quot; ports. I did take a bottle of the Cab Franc home, and it was alright, but I didn&apos;t love it. For the port itself, I liked the Ozark Strong a bit more than the Big C (which is a tawny). The Sweet Spring which is a Chambourcin was my favorite, good finish.\\n\\nThe star? The Vignoles which is a French hybrid from the Keels Creek Vineyard and another nearby farm (I believe the owner said it is in Hindsville, not too far away). It has some really nice Pineapple notes. It&apos;s not toooo dry, but dry enough. I love this with spicy chili or tacos. I think it would also go well with some smoked fish or chicken. I also enjoyed the Chardonel and could totally taste those green apple notes. The Melange was pretty sweet for me, but the finish I really liked.\\n\\nAll COVID regulations were followed. The owner wore a mask, kept physically distanced and any type I removed my mask to sip, he stepped back even more. Another couple came in and waited in a sitting area.\\n\\n5 stars for being low key, a great white and local!",

            "description": "My husband and I came for a tasting planning to bring home a bottle of Arkansas wine. We&apos;ve never had wine from this region before.  When we entered the shop, it was empty except for one couple at the bar. They were doing a tasting. The woman behind the counter told us she would be with us as soon as she finished with the couple. We waited thinking that she would do a pour and then help us while they tasted their selection. After about 8 minutes, it became clear that she was going to finish their ENTIRE TASTING before even inviting us to sit down. At that point, we decided to just order a glass and not do a tasting. We approached the bar again to ask about a specific wine and to place an order for wine to take to a table.  Clearly irritated, she firmly told us that she would be with us when the current couple finished their tasting, so we left. We live right in the middle of Texas wine country, and visit wineries frequently and have NEVER experienced anything like this in Texas, California, Italy, or anywhere else. Tasting room staff are typically able to work with multiple customers at the same time. If this woman is too challenged to serve more than one customer/small group at time, management should consider getting her some help or replacing her with someone who can actually serve customers and make sales. We were disappointed to not have experienced any Arkansas wine. Some of it looked very interesting. If you decide to go here, I hope your experience is better than ours.",

They offered free wine tastings and $5 glasses of wine which seemed like a great deal.  The tastings were pretty good and fairly informative but the Sommelier was extremely standoffish and not engaging at all.  She seemed very irritated by us when we were just trying to make polite conversation.  She seemed to want to hurry though it although we were the only ones there and I about 1 hour before closing.  We did end up buying a bottle of wine and probably would have purchased more if she had been a bit more welcoming and a better salesperson! The gentleman that checked us out (perhaps the owner?) was very nice, however.  We decided to get a glass of wine and enjoy it on their nice little patio after the quick tasting.  \\nI&apos;ve always enjoyed wine tastings in small wineries like this and love the conversation that usually comes along with the tastings.  Perhaps she was having a bad day?",

She couldn&apos;t wait to get rid of us. She sized us up the minute we walked in the door and was cold through the entire experience. I&apos;ve reached an age to just ignore people like that but today I was speaking to another tourist and she had a similar experience and so I decided to do this Yelp review.  The business is for sale and I think it could be very popular and a must do destination if the hospitality can be improved. And by the way, we did buy 4 bottles of wine but will NOT be going back.",

She needs a better fitting mask. We weren&apos;t comfortable taking our masks down inside so we asked to do a tasting outside, and she was nice enough to oblige- which she probably can&apos;t do when it&apos;s busier, but it was pretty quiet at 4pm when we visited. The wines were pretty sour I general, though the muscat and port were nice (and I&apos;m not normally a sweet wine drinker). Positive marks for customer service, but the slipping mask was a huge red flag for us. We realize that establishments can&apos;t always control what their customers do to take safety precautions for COVID, but there is never an excuse for staff to slack on this.",

It&apos;s a lovely space and absolutely perfect for a yarn shop.  The owner was warm and approachable.  She had yarn and merchandise for spinning wool into yarn.  There was embroidery materials and supplies.  Though the store is closing, there was still a nice amount of merchandise to choose from.  It wasn&apos;t picked over.  It was a pleasant experience and I am certain Eureka Springs is losing an important business on this portion of the block.  The space lends itself to what it is, in my opinion.

When the product starting burning I had enough and asked to just rinse it out.  She rolled her eyes ( which had way to much and to dark of shadow on them)  she bit my head off, to which I replied you are a very rude person to which she responded YOU ARE RUDE! JUST floored I could not get out of there fast enough. When I went to pay which I know I know I should not have.. 80 for them to screw my hair up. When I got home she had tacked on an additional 17 I&apos;m assuming a tip??? Which was not deserved and is highly illegal. I did take a picture.. If u value your hair DONT go here.",

When I couldn&apos;t get in touch with my regular stylist, I decided to give this girl a try. I have two-toned hair, blonde on top, red on bottom. I wanted a highlight and trim. Long story short...the little girl MELTED MY HAIR!! I understand that can happen and I tried not to panic. She had to cut off ALOT of hair to try her best to get rid of the melted hair. Did a deep conditioner...my hair still looks a bit like a cotton ball. That&apos;s not the worst part...the woman instructor along with one of the owner&apos;s sons came over and told me that they would waive the fee for the deep conditioner so I&apos;d only owe $41!!  I told her I wasn&apos;t paying to have my hair melted to which they responded &quot;that&apos;s theft of services&quot; and threatened to call the police on me. The owner&apos;s son proceeded to insult me saying my hair was fried before I came in. Let me mention that I get at least 2-3 compliments a day on my hair...it was a little dry because I bleach the top, it was far from fried and I typically do the color myself. I have never ended up with melted hair. Ironically, I decided to do highlights on the top because I wanted LESS damage. I ended up calling the police myself when they told me if I left without paying they would get my license number and have me arrested. Turned out....I had to pay...I&apos;ll have to take them to small claims court if I want my money back.

Do not, I repeat, do not attend this college. If you are not related to anyone of importance or are rich, you will be treated like trash.  \\n\\nPlease, do yourself a favor. Don&apos;t go to this college. This school is dying all because the leadership and President won&apos;t change their childish ways. \\n\\nThey are racist, hypocritical and do not want poor &apos;nobodies&apos; at their school. \\n\\nOh, don&apos;t forget how his grandsons have full-ride scholarships to the college.

While UCA has very strong and well-rounded Chemistry and Physics departments (some of the best in the state, in my opinion), they tend to focus their interests in Football and Business. While this is their main constituency in numbers, I feel that this is a fatal move that can keep this school focusing on the less relevant features of a top-notch school. The recent donation to the Lewis Science Center from Conway Corp and the recent large acquisitions of research funding by the departments should stand as an extreme message to Tom Courtway that the real substance of a successful school is in its academia and not its sports. This is why UCA receives 4 out of 5 from me. \\n\\nThere&apos;s a lot of potential for this school in the sciences. The science departments have top-notch professors that are sending students off to graduate school at places like Harvard, Cornell, Georgia-Tech, Penn State and other high quality graduate schools. It just feels like no one is noticing the extreme achievements of these professors and missing a grand opportunity to capitalize on UCA&apos;s true strengths. Get with it, Mr. Courtway. You have an excellent opportunity with these professors. A great school is built off of strong science and academia, not sports. This is where UCA should be sinking its money.\\n\\nBut, as I am graduating soon, I appreciate the opportunities afforded to me at this university. UCA has provided a decent experience for me and allowed me to expand into new territories of my life that were previously unreachable. Thank you!",

            "description": "I saw advertisements for Artist at Heart Paint Party online and quickly dismissed them! I am NO artist. Why would I even try something like that??\\n \\nBoy was I wrong!!\\n\\nI was thumbing through a magazine and saw a painting hanging  in a fancy house and I fell in love!! Way out of my budget probably. So I thought to myself, how hard can that be to make myself?  It&apos;s an abstract, maybe I can figure it out. \\n\\nStill I was frozen in self doubt! Then I remembered that advertisement I saw online and contacted the artist offering the classes. \\n\\nDenyse was kind, helpful and insightful. She gave me suggestions, directed me to videos of her classes that would help me and even followed up!!\\n\\nSo much encouragement, I feel like I can do it. I can go back and rewatch the videos and send questions via email if I need to. Her online classes are interactive, too! All this from the comfort of home! \\n\\nThanks so much Denyse for helping me find my inner artist!",

Therefore, my wife and I drove from another state to take a tour and were told by our daycare to do it unannounced to get a true feeling on how they interact with the kids and with you. We entered to building... Yes we entered the building and walked around for 15 minutes looking (without a code) and did not run into a singleness member. This should have been our first warning to run but I gave them the benefit and tracked down a worker due to no staff being in their offices either. The staff member said they were celebrating a event and said tonsit and wait and the director would come out and speak with us. So we waited for 15 minutes and subsequently I went and tracked down another staff member and asked if the director had time for us today. Finally the director came out of a room and seemed irritated to even speak with us. She said no tours could be given today. I asked if we could come back later in day to do a tour and her response was no I have to pick my kids up at 3. I then asked her if anyone else was available to give a tour and her response was no. After this attempt my wife and I left. Please don&apos;t bring your kids to this daycare due to safety concerns with anybody being able to walk in /out unannounced and the unpleasant staff that could possibly take care of your kids.",

            "description": "this is review for Little Einstein, Bentonville AR.\\n\\nPros first:  My child&apos;s first school and he never cried, always happy to go, he had great teachers in Junior preschool, though he was in the process of potty training the teachers accepted him without pull ups ( which is just wonderful), as usually schools would prefer pull ups till child is not fully trained.\\n\\n\\nNow the cons: it doesnt have any streamlined curriculum that is followed but each week is dedicated to a particular theme and activities are developed around it.  \\nDuring December 2013, after my son spent like nearly 4 months in junior preschool,  the school reshuffled its classes and surprisingly my child was pushed from Junior preschool ( 2- 3 years ) to early preschool (19- 30 months) though he was just 3 weeks short of 30 months.  There wasnt any  prior intimation, nor were parents concerns invited. I mean how can you demote a child to a lower school program, there is definitely some big difference between the two levels.   I observed that the children in early preschool were mostly exposed to television and showed stuff like Curious George ... \\n\\nThough we have relocated and thankfully out of the class otherwise i would have to wait for my child to go to Junior again only if there was any vacancy again.  So weird !!!\\n\\nThe teachers, esp Ms Becky, junior preschool was great... however the school management is not very friendly.",

I will speak for the infant/toddler rooms only for this is where my child was at during his enrollment. There is high turnover with the teachers, inconsistent structure, sporadic or sometimes no updates on child throughout the day on the &quot;daily connect app&quot;, dirty rooms, children sharing their belongings, etc. I had a Tylenol bottle come up empty after just buying it! Was this given to my child? Other children? Nobody seemed to know anything about it. My child came home with a huge scratch on his arm and there is still a scar from it. Again, none of the teachers knew what happened. I would not recommend this place for your child especially if you are like me and want to have good interactive relationships with your child&apos;s teachers and be informed about your child at all times.",

            "description": "WARNING! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A PHILOSOPHY.\\n\\nA review of any college is perhaps more a ridiculous proposition than reviewing other things because, in addition to the usual vagaries of opinion, a college of any size will not be experienced by two people in remotely the same way. Are you a student (whether traditional or not; whether serious or not -- I&apos;ll not say, whether intelligent or not), an office worker, administrator, instructor, or someone attached to the college in some cooperative capacity, or a combination of any of these? NWACC is large enough to encompass a plethora of experiences. So, a review that begins, &quot;My algebra teacher was a bore,&quot; wouldn&apos;t begin to characterize the potential of any community college.\\n\\nAs for me (who functions as an employee, one that has worked at other community colleges and universities), I enjoy the campus, which is nicer than many other campi (noun, Latin plural). That is important; I like clean lines. The library, which is always the clincher, will more than adequately support most any academic endeavor, for both student and professional, with friendly assistance. As for the education, accessibility is stressed, I have clearly seen, which is good news for many. And, out of the classroom, college culture is promoted in a variety of ways, for those who require that.\\n\\nWhat else can be said? Yeah, that one guy cut me off in the parking lot. Rotten teen drivers! And, they don&apos;t offer the Vietnamese courses I would like to take ... maybe even throw in a field trip to Saigon. Oh, well. Still, I&apos;m a fan.",

After medical examination they were  abrasions (like rug burn)  and not at all any type of bruise... Director made false accusations about incidents that happened with my child and contacted children services instead of filing an incident report for the abrasions made at the facility... Assistant director gave me paperwork and the director decided to attempt to snatch them out of my hand like a child... Director screamed and my mother and my face in front of my children..  Director couldn&apos;t keep her story straight about why she thought there was physical abuse involved and every time was question about it her story changed in the allegations got worse... Highly don&apos;t recommend the facility... All they had to do is make one incident report for the incident that happened at the school and that was it and they were too childish to do so..",

Granted the place must be good if they&apos;re always full, but they completely lack integrity when it comes to getting new families to sign up. We paid the $100 registration fee and were told that they would have an opening in a few months. We&apos;ve waited for more than a year and still haven&apos;t gotten in. I tried to work with them on getting my money back before posting anything, but it doesn&apos;t matter that they blatantly sold me on something they don&apos;t have. The only thing that matters to them is the contract I had signed which protects them from their dishonesty.",

We have been so thrilled with the quality of care our boys receive. They love being dropped off and I love that I get updates all day on their routines and learning via the ap. The transparency is wonderful for peace of mind. \\n\\nMy children are learning so much and thriving. They are loved on and cared for and happy! I would (and do) recommend this school to anyone looking. \\n\\nI also love that with my older sons food allergies they are so aware (everyone from kitchen to directors to floating help) that I never have to worry - they treat him as if he is their own and make all accommodations. \\n\\nBeing away from them is hard enough so knowing that they are safe, healthy, happy and enjoying their day is so wonderful!",

The teachers and front office staff are the friendliest you can find, and the teachers are all extremely kind and attentive. The kids are happy, the facility is clean. It&apos;s really the best!

First off, yes I will agree with Rachel J&apos;s review below about the previous asst director, however since we started she left about a month after and things couldn&apos;t be any better!  I get updates on my little girl throughout the day and pictures as well!  I love all the art projects they do with the little ones and book reading, exploring, playing outdoors, etc.... No matter how young, they have a curriculum planned daily for your little one.  I don&apos;t feel like I could even come close to matching all the fun things they do here with my little one.  It seems like she comes home weekly learning and saying something new.  I just love it!  And the teachers and staff here are OUTSTANDING!  You can tell they genuinely care for your child and not sure how, but everyone knows her by name, office staff and other teachers she&apos;s never had.  \\n\\nI will add, no one paid me to write this, just an honest review because I know how hard it is to find GREAT childcare.  I think I toured over half of them in the area and if it&apos;s not the BEST then it&apos;s not for my little one.  Thanks Cadence staff for being so great!!",

From the moment we walked in, we felt the warmth, care, and professionalism that encompass the entire center. Annalyn, the director has done a wonderful job getting to know all the students and families and making us all feel welcome and part of the Cadence family. Any questions or concerns I&apos;ve had have been immediately answered or addressed. \\nAll of the teachers have great attitudes and genuinely care about their students. They provide plenty of one on one time throughout the day, and even extra TLC when needed. Miss Abbie, the lead infant teacher does a fantastic job and is passionate about her babies. She has worked with my twins through several transitions already and continues to teach them new skills everyday. We would love for her to move to toddlers with them!\\n\\nOverall, Cadence Academy is a top notch school in Rogers and comes highly recommended. I don&apos;t know how anyone could have anything negative to say about this school and the staff!",

Nodin has been with this location for about 4 months now. He&apos;s 2 1/2 and an only child. We moved here from Denver in August and it hasn&apos;t been the easiest transition for him. Enrolling him at La petite Bentonville Ar. has been the one of the best choices as parents we&apos;ve made. We recently started potty training and genuinely had no idea how much work time and stress can accompany that life change. Our son who has always slept through the night started getting up multiple times each night as he curiously wanting to grasp this new toilet concept. I more often than not drop him off at La Petite Academy after having had almost no sleep  and every morning Whitney and I go over his progress and she gives suggestions and tips I would not know otherwise. She is completely dedicated to every child in the building and having someone to answer my questions, tactically make me aware of potential mistakes, while still making me feel validated as a mother has truly been a blessing. I trust her and the staff completely while my son is i their care  and to me that&apos;s priceless.",

They allow the ABA therapists from Thrive and the OT and SLT therapy teams to work at the school.  The director and teachers really work together with the therapists to help our son get ready for kindergarten.  Joe was not speaking many words when he started, and his language has increased and his skills have improved where he can attend a general education classroom next year.  La Petite is truly a safe, fun, educational, and perfect place for our son to learn and make friends.

More importantly, very few who are as tolerant, inclusive, and focused on raising children to honor peace and civility and to appreciate the natural world around them.\\n\\nMontessori is not daycare. It is not even your traditional school. Children at Walnut Farm are empowered to do things for themselves, and to study that which interests them most. In addition to several well appointed Montessori classrooms they also have a few unique features such as an outdoor classroom where children are learning life skills including gardening and caring for animals. The school also has a natural playground with features literally carved from the forested hillside.\\n\\nI see my little boy growing into a confident, warm, caring, and intelligent young man at Walnut Farm. He loves to read and do math. He is fascinated by and in love with every kind of animal. He loves his teachers and his classmates. \\n\\nWhen kids reach school age, we rely on the school to mold them into the people we want them to be. Schools have the kids from 8 to 3 most days, leaving just 4 or 5 hours with their parents. If they are going to play that big a role in the development of my child... then I feel strongly about choosing a school that not only does a good job educating my child, but also teaches him to grow up tolerant of the many differences in people around the world. \\n\\nThey take children from toddlers through around the equivalent of 6th grade.",

I&apos;m a strong advocate of the Montessori method and Walnut Farm has been at it for a long time... they know what they&apos;re doing.  When we meet former students or even older kids at the school now, we&apos;re so impressed with their maturity, awareness and capabilities.",

            "description": "We moved from California over a year ago. My daughter has been attending Walnut Farm as a preschooler for the present school year. We absolutely love the school and it&apos;s staff. The teachers are truly special and amazing! They are witty, kind, knowledgable,compassionate, creative, and have such a wealth of experience. We have a lot of experience with having been through 6 preschools between both of my kids. We love the involvement with nature and the lack of electronics in the school. My daughter learned to read in the past year, and her confidence is amazing. She has also learned great conflict resolution skills (communication) and real life skills (ex: setting/clearing the table). This school has a great peaceful &amp; positive enviornment  that is very welcoming. I am so grateful that they are here!",

We wanted a place where his natural curiosity can be fostered. We wanted a place where tolerance, acceptance, and peace are just a natural part of the day. \\n\\nNot only is he receiving core curriculum (reading, writing, math, science), but he is exposed to rich extras such as Spanish, nature education, life skills, art, and music. Children learn to investigate and research from a very young age. The learning is sparked by interest - so the child is more invested in it. \\n\\nThe Montessori method truly is remarkable and Walnut Farm does a lovely job of presenting an authentic experience. The classrooms - both indoor and outdoor - are led by caring, passionate teachers where the students are encouraged to engage with the lessons. They are empowered to learn and given the necessary tools to do so.\\n\\nIf you have a child between 18 months and 12 years and want more than just a traditional education, consider a visit to Walnut Farm. It is my greatest hope that you see what my family saw the very first time we set foot on the campus.",

It really gives the children freedom to explore what interests them and therefore stretches their attention and learning.  They have an outdoor classroom with a teacher outside at all times for instruction.  I think that is amazing!  There are two trained teachers in each room.  They offer Spanish, art, and life skills along with your typical school subjects.  We are very happy with the school and so is our child.",

No additional fees like some other places. We spent several hours there finishing our items. The staff was friendly and very kind and patient with my seven year old who lost interest in finishing her project after the second coat. The other customers were also very kind. While we were there, they hosted two parties and several other guests but we still had all the supplies we needed and staff to help when needed. We are excited to return and pick up our items and to revisit with my other children. We will definitely go back!  \\nThey recently moved to this location in High st from the Plaza Mall. The building is very old and they have done some reno/restoration to it. \\n\\nUpdate: \\nWe picked up our items and they look fabulous!! We will defiantly return!",

We were all a bit overly ambitious in picking out ceramics to paint (we were first-timers and didn&apos;t know what we were doing). As such, we ended up needing to come in for a total of over 7 hours over the course of a few days to finish our projects. Karen, the owner, was so very patient with us and incredibly kind. She made sure that we had all the tools and paints we needed to make our projects. She had exactly the right balance of being available to answer questions and give us additional information without seeming in the way or overbearing. She even offered to let us borrow some paints to take home to work on our pieces outside of the studio&apos;s open hours. That kind of generosity and customer service is a true gift.\\n\\nBeyond that, the ambiance of the place is perfect for unleashing an inner artist. As a very old building, the original features of the home have been marked and dated, making it fun to wonder about what the 1860&apos;s original wall-paper must have seen in its time!\\n\\nThe prices for the pieces are incredibly reasonable, and without additional sitting fees or firing fees, the fun-per-dollar ratio is a fantastic one. We also found a fantastic deal on Living Social, making the experience even more of bargain.\\n\\nIn sum, I would highly recommend Create-A-Palooza to individuals, couples, families, and anyone else who has an interest in being creative!",

I also was accepted years ago at the Dickinson School of Law, which is un-related to DC but sits at the edge of its campus. As such, I&apos;ve been to Carlisle a number of times over the past 30 years, both as a prospective law student and as the parent of a DC student. Here&apos;s my &quot;review&quot; of Dickinson College and the surrounding town/area...\\n\\nBeautiful campus, strong alumni network, including extremely successful alums like the CEO/President of LL Bean. Numerous awards for being a top-rated college as to sustainability. Responsive staff. Small student to teacher ratio. Encourages students to find their passion, so interesting combinations of double majors and majors/minor abound, and students don&apos;t declare their major until Jr year, I believe.\\n\\nEncourages study abroad and for a somewhat unique statistic I think, Dickinson states that 60% of its student athletes do so, with the coaches&apos; encouragement! \\n\\nDickinson is what it appears to be, &quot;family&quot; to its alumns and students. Extremely supportive all-around. \\n\\nLocation is close to Harrisburg, the Commonwealth&apos;s capital, as well as an easy 1.75 hour ride to Phila area (85 miles in my case!) as a straight shot down the PA  Turnpike!\\n\\nOne comment stated this is a boring school with nothing to do. That&apos;s ridiculous. There are attractions within an easy drive, _lots_of activities on campus, and a growing diversity of students. And, to callously call the surrounding area as being full of &quot;red-necks&quot; is nonsense. As a former diversity trainer with a major Fortune50 company and within the USCG Aux, that statement really jolted me.\\n\\nThe folks in Carlisle may be more rural in background than say someone from a city or a suburb near a city, but they are welcoming and friendly. Judging an entire community based on some interaction had with one or two (perhaps) is simply unfair to the community as a whole).\\n\\nGo Red Devils!\\n\\nPS To YELP: Why the heck would you NOT recommend the 3 &quot;Not Recommended&quot; 5-star reviews that were well-written, thoughtful and gave details upon which the reviews were based? And, from both students and parents! I don&apos;t get it! If they were included, DC would have a near 5-Star rating which is more in-line with what I&apos;ve experienced via the many alumns I&apos;ve met, both at DC functions AND by pure chance in the &quot;big outside world&quot; where they had no reason to be biased in their view...i.e. I met them via normal, everyday encounters via my job, etc!",

            "description": "I could not be happier than I am with this school.  Both my children have attended since its beginning, then we moved and they attended an excellent public school for one year in Virginia. When we found out we could move back to the area if we wanted (while the husband went over seas) there was no hesitation to do so.  A HUGE reason we made this decision was because of Little Scholars.  They are very caring and professional.  The class sizes are not found in any other school in the area and each child gets personal instruction designed for their learning needs/level.  I have asked both my children which school setting they liked better and they both agreed they preferred little scholars but didn&apos;t dislike public schools. (Being perfectly honest) as a parent I know without a doubt they are getting a far superior education than they would be getting at any public school.   This school does mix in traditional school with Montessori and I love that fact.  Most will move from the Montessori setting on to a more traditional setting (like we did for one year) and these children will have little if any issues transitioning.  Neither of my children had any problems adjusting to the public school routine and then adjusting back to Montessori.  \\n\\nI am a very happy parent and would recommend Little Scholars to anyone with an interest in developing foundations for future learning to check them out.",

When I first went to observe this school I knew that I had found the place I wanted my children to begin their education experience ! My children learned so much and really enjoyed being there on a daily basis. They gained confidence in their social interactions and in their abilities to read and write. They learned about different cultures and customs and became aware of our world. I am so happy that they received such a strong base to begin their education! I highly recommend this school! The staff is AMAZING! Just STUNNING! We love them. They have helped me so much with my children. My village is complete because of them!",

            "description": "I would attend just about any school before going here, and here&apos;s why: \\n\\nIf you&apos;re considering going to Miller-Motte in order to make a better future for yourself, please do as much research as possible. Not all schools are created equally nor are the instructors who ultimately hold huge sway in the likelihood of your success. A lot of reviewers take time to discuss accreditation. This review is not going to be one of them, but that&apos;s an important topic as well considering that many reviewers attempted to transfer credit earned at MMTC to another school and were unable to do so. Please check into where you can take your credits, especially if you are Military personnel or a dependent and are going to relocate prior to your graduation. \\n\\nI attended their massage therapy school and initially felt good about that decision. \\nThe people who were responsible for enrolling me were kind and helpful and seemed to be genuinely interested in the success of their students. It wasn&apos;t until I was well into the program that I began to second guess everything. \\n\\nFirst off, the scheduling for the LMT students is extremely inflexible. If you have a full time job and are the primary breadwinner of your household, you&apos;re gonna have a bad time (quoting the South Park meme, here). The reason for this is is because the classes run from about 8 in the morning until between 2 p.m. and 7:30 at night. You will be going at a minimum of 6 hours/day 5 days/week and depending on the class will be given ample amounts of homework, making this essentially a full time job. This is doable if you have a lot of grant/loan money to make up the difference for missed work while you&apos;re in the program or have a spouse who can support you while you&apos;re completing the program, but if you are already working a 50 hour a week job, have nobody to help you and are a single parent doing all of this, you will struggle. \\n\\nI won&apos;t mention names, but I met at least a couple of women who were working minimum wage jobs full time as single parents who had to drop out, were sleeping in class because of the grueling schedules they kept and who not only had no support from the faculty, but who were bad-mouthed in class by their instructors to other students. I witnessed this firsthand; the instructors were ridiculing these students during class and were marking down their grades with little to no explanation. \\n\\nTwo instructors who work at the Clarksville, TN campus, one of which still works there, were particularly problematic. It didn&apos;t matter how much you applied yourself, how dedicated you were as a student: if they didn&apos;t like you as a person, you would get D&apos;s and C&apos;s. You would get disciplined for anything and everything while other students whom they liked slept during class, came in late, and acted generally disrespectful. I realize that some students don&apos;t take their education seriously and deserve the low GPA, but I&apos;m not talking about these people. There is a genuine lack of professionalism with Miller-Motte&apos;s faculty and I would go so far as to call some of the instructors bullies. \\n\\nFor example: one woman in our Swedish Massage class was called out for needing to use the bathroom &quot;too often&quot;; the same instructor made sarcastic, snide comments in front of us over anything and everything she did. If she did what every other student does and had a snack in class, she was called out for it. If she was late like every other student was from time to time, she suffered more serious consequences. When the director was informed, she tried to help, but it was impossible to convey the seriousness of what was happening when it was so hard to prove. But we saw what was going on; we just kept our heads down and said nothing because we were afraid of our GPAs being affected. \\n\\nAnother instructor made a huge scene over a student over god knows what; she said she &quot;felt disrespected&quot; by them, but they were being quiet in class, doing their work, and didn&apos;t say much. Apparently, it was the fact that she &quot;wasn&apos;t providing enough feedback in class&quot; that irked the instructor, so for the remainder of the year, she was targeted for arbitrary and completely irrelevant reasons. \\nThis, again, while the more favored students could be late, loud and inconsiderate, have their late attendance overlooked and so on. \\n\\nI tried to take my complaints to Academic Affairs after the stress of being in such an unhealthy, unprofessional environment began to take its toll on my ability to even focus in class, but was dismissed largely because I wasn&apos;t directly involved. Now that I&apos;m licensed and out of there, however, I feel like I have an obligation to speak out so that others who spend thousands of dollars and invest so much time, energy and effort to try and build a better future for themselves aren&apos;t jeopardized. Avoid this school if you can.",

Jamie and Bubba, the two main instructors, not only ensured my class and I completed the program with the necessary skills to be a competent EMT, but they personally mentored and instilled confidence in each and every single one of us. Before I knew it, I began to see my instructors and classmates as my second family as well.\\n\\nThe curriculum follows the NREMT guidelines and is broken into in-class lectures, online assignments, and psychomotor skill practical days (once a month on Sundays). The course is definitely challenging and will require work on your part. If you do not put the necessary time and energy into practicing and studying, it will show through. However, the support Jamie and Bubba provides will ensure you do not risk falling behind. \\n\\nWhat I believe sets Drexel&apos;s EMT program apart from all others is simply the passion and dedication Jamie and Bubba possess for educating the next generation of emergency medical providers. They take immense pride in teaching their students and watching them succeed in becoming certified EMT-B. They are truly two of the most, if the not the most, committed educators I have had the pleasure to learn from. It was an honor and pleasure to have learned from them.\\n\\nIf anyone has any questions on the program or wish to learn more, I would be more than happy to speak with you and provide more in-depth details of my time there.\\n\\nP.S. I received my EMT-B certification within less than a month of completing the course.",

I left not only with the skills needed to obtain my certification, but with the support of a fantastic group of EMS professionals who became like a second family to me over the duration of the course.\\n\\nThe course follows the NREMT training guidelines and was kept stringently up-to-date with new protocols, so rest assured that you will leave with the skills to handle any emergency situation you may find yourself in. The training is split between in-person lectures and online skill reviews, with a couple of in-depth skill drilling days as the exam (!!) draws nearer.\\n\\nThat said, this is the basic format that I would expect from any high-quality EMT-B course. What makes the Drexel program stand head and shoulders above the rest is the people who teach it. My course was taught by Jamie Teufel, who to this day remains one of my favorite instructors I have ever had, in any discipline. His genuine passion for EMS combined with his unwavering dedication to the success of his students made the class not just a requirement, but an absolute pleasure to take. Personally invested in each member of the class, he guided us through the convoluted process (get it together, NREMT and PADOH -- you&apos;re killing a small forest with the number of forms we have to fill out) with a seemingly endless supply of patience and knowledge.\\n\\nI could not more highly recommend that anyone interested in becoming a certified EMT take their course through the Drexel University College of Medicine -- as long as Jamie is there, and you&apos;re willing to do the legwork, I guarantee it will be one of the best experiences of your life. If you have any questions about my experience taking the course, please don&apos;t hesitate to reach out -- I would love to expand on many of the details I couldn&apos;t include here in the name of brevity.",

            "description": "The EMT-B program at Drexel is second to none. I came in with uncertainty in my ability and left with so much knowledge and confidence in my ability to treat patients. \\n\\nJamie Teufel, the course director and one of the instructors, is extremely passionate about teaching. Although I had never planned in practicing as an EMT because I was planning to pursue an M.D., I learned so much that has actually benefited me now that I am in medical school.\\n\\nSome background, I am the quintessential socially awkward nerd who is afraid to touch a patient but can tell you a lot about Biochemical pathways. As a result, I was quite terrified about not being good enough in terms of communication and being a physician who is more than a nerd. If you work in the medical field, you know that effective communication, with patients and fellow health-care providers, is imperative to good care. But rest assured, I was not to be left hanging. \\n\\nJamie and Bubba, our main instructors, made sure that all of us not only learned how to be basic EMTs but how to be competent providers. While there is a lot of work to be done, it is designed to give us the most for our time and accelerate us to be our best. The curriculum consists of both lectures and labs that are designed to teach us the roles of an EMT and the physical and communication skills that are expected of us. There are a variety of labs from a pig lab (in which we explore the lung and heart anatomy of a pig) to a Mass Casualty Incident (MCI) day in which we utilize all our skills in a simulated environment. While time consuming, these labs and labs in which we practice our skills are designed to train us in becoming proficient providers.\\n\\nIn addition to a well-designed and implemented curriculum, Jamie and Bubba are ALWAYS there to address your concerns. Because there are numerous labs, some may have time conflicts, but Jamie is always willing to work with you to ensure that you get the best education that you can. They are highly flexible because their goal is to create the best EMTs/health-care providers, and for good reason- we represent the institution when we practice. There is NO room for sub-par work!\\n\\nI highly recommend this program for anyone interested in becoming an EMT and anyone who is interested in becoming a health-care provider in general. These skills that are taught are the FOUNDATIONS to becoming competent health-care provider and can easily distinguish the &quot;good&quot; providers from the excellent.\\n\\nTLDR: Excellent program with phenomenal instructors who have high standards for their students. There&apos;s a lot of work but you&apos;ll learn a lot and become a better health-care provider because of it. On the fence? Try it out, you won&apos;t regret it.",

I&apos;m a &quot;lifer.&quot; I&apos;m currently going for my third master&apos;s degree at the Law School. The campus is a beautiful place. When I first arrived here in 1989, it was kind of seedy outside the campus in West Philly. Not going to lie, I was afraid to stay out past 8pm. Moving to Center City was probably the best idea. The resources of this university are vast, so whatever you want to study, you can probably find it here. I do wish I attended this school as an undergrad because it seems the people who love this school the most are undergrads, but I do not regret the path I took to get here. If I had to do it all over again, I&apos;d probably stay in Boston and go to the big H.",

            "description": "Part 1. This was the worst experience with a university in my life. I have two undergraduate depress from exceptional school, one in a consortium with U Penn. Those two previous schools were excellent in the treatment of students, teaching, provided health services, advising, and on and on. U.Penn. fails students, at least graduate nursing students, horribly. Just look at the suicide rate. Also, this past year the new head of the mental health center killed himself after working here just 8 months I believe. He had come from Cornell, a notoriously depressing place. Penn is a dangerous cruel environment that you should avoid if you care about your sanity or education at all. \\nI tried to contact my advisor when I started here. She didn&apos;t respond for over six months. I finally went to the general student adviser, but sadly she quit. The advisors I had, and there were multiple, were selfish, unhelpful, and generally failing their advisees. Penn does little to help the student or guide them. I had to jump through a large number of hoops for the graduate nursing program and Penn did nothing to make this easier for the students. There was no advisor guidance, paper instructions, nothing to help make it easier. \\nWe were required to provide health records, but Penn didn&apos;t accept mine for some reason even though my prior employer (a hospital) accepted and provided them. They wanted to re-vaccinate me for literally everything. \\nGetting licensed in NJ and DE is not easy and Penn doesn&apos;t help you. \\nThey don&apos;t bring in someone to do flu shots for the nursing student or give step by step instructions on where to go to fulfill the licensing procedures. I found that the advisor really only cares about doing his or her own research, teaching is a distant second, and helping students comes last if at all. \\nWhen I started there they said they wanted us to succeed and they would do everything they could to help us do that. That&apos;s a blatant lie. If you send an e-mail with multiple questions, I know from experience you will either get a response to only one of your questions or get turfed off to someone else to answer you.  If you need extra help in a class and ask the professor where to find someone to tutor you, they either don&apos;t know or send you to someone who is tutoring 15 other people at the same time and only shows up about 3 out of 8 sessions because he or she is busy too. \\nYelp is saying my review is too long, so I&apos;ll do another review as part two.",

Academics aside, the campus is just gorgeous. Red bricks form the walkways, which are heavily shaded by rows of towering trees. The buildings are historic, but not old or run-down enough to the point of archaism. \\n\\nI attended an info session and campus tour, which were both fine in their own right (I got a bunch of free &quot;fancy brochures&quot;, which I&apos;m definitely not complaining about), but the campus itself made the biggest impression. The off-campus atmosphere was mediocre at best, but the on-campus environment proved itself to be homely and relaxing and just a wonderful place to spend an afternoon (or four years) at.

While I was there, I had a chance to take classes from business and engineering to urban studies and foreign languages (I even got to take American Sign Language class, too!).\\n\\nMy friends all are successful in the paths and passions they choose to pursue.

But since this is Yelp, I&apos;m going to direct my attentions to people who are going to visit this place for the beauty of the campus, or who are thinking of living nearby, and not to try to impose my opinion on prospective students (who should be asking current students 1:1 for college-picking advice anyway). \\n\\nPenn&apos;s campus&apos;s big cohesive force is Locust Walk, which connects the high rise residences (where a lot of students end up living, either in the high-rises or on cheap off-campus housing) all the way to the buildings on the far sides of campus. This brick boulevard is lined with trees and keeps the campus from feeling like just another part of the city. Walking down Locust sort of feels like walking through an actual park, especially at night when the hordes of students have trickled down to just you and your footsteps. \\n\\nPenn&apos;s buildings are quite grand and beautiful, especially Fisher Fine Arts Library, which is so nice that drawing classes tend to come here to sketch its innards. The New College House, on the other hand, is very contemporary and decked out with cool tech for its residents. Finally, the high-rises offer views that you don&apos;t get tired of for your entire undergrad career, and only suck in the winter when they form wind tunnels of hell that blow you backwards while you struggle towards your dorm. \\n\\nFoodwise, the campus is ringed with tons of restaurants, but the best food is across the bridge near Rittenhouse Square. Same with groceries -- there are some expensive, meh-quality places to get ingredients on campus, but Trader Joe&apos;s has by far the fresher produce and fairer prices. \\n\\nTime sort of passes instantaneously while walking around campus after you get used to it, and I&apos;ve learned to cut through certain buildings to shave off five minutes or so from my commute at a time. As a student the campus feels smaller and smaller every year, but the streets named after tree varieties never quite become engrained into memory, and in freshman year I remember getting lost between 38th and 39th.",

The students and staff use millions of dollars worth of local supplies and spend plenty of money in the city proper, not just on-campus. While students are encouraged to be careful of the surroundings, it&apos;s no where near as dangerous to students as more than a dozen years ago.\\n\\nWhile some of the buildings were old and scary (ever check out the basement in DRL?), others are brand-spanking new and spit-polished shiny (Huntsman, anyone?), and the University does try hard to make everything close enough for students to access for those who either don&apos;t wish to go downtown or don&apos;t know better to go downtown.  The food carts were a blessing at almost all hours, the cafeteria food wasn&apos;t really that bad (although the service was inconsistent), and Wawa was always open to serve up a sandwich for you. Over the years, more bike lanes appeared and more cops patrol the area, and a facelift was given to Houston Hall / Perelman Quad, the Quad itself got air conditioning, and the high rises were given new names (although I&apos;ll still refer to them all as High Rise East, North, and South), and new windows &amp; paint.\\n\\n1920 Commons still can&apos;t match Hill for food, but they added many fast food options on-campus from a Taco Bell to Subway. While I miss my Burger King, the food carts, again, help to make up for it.  Fresh Grocer now adds value as a large grocery store for the students at a decent price, and the Bridge provides entertainment as a movie theater.\\n\\nNew Deck, Smokes, Allegros and more are food options, and bubble tea has even grown from when my friends decided to do it as a project during their college years. And Locust Walk has even undergone renovation... they moved Ben Franklin to in front of Steiny-D for now as they repair his old spot by the compass.\\n\\nA big university hospital helped to diagnose issues with friends, and treats countless community members for injuries both great and small.  Research is heavily invested in, and the libraries are second to none.\\n\\nThere are bad professors and good, but that&apos;s like any other institution. I can&apos;t name a single school which has outstanding researchers &amp; outstanding teachers in every single class, nor will there ever be with the plethora of people that come through here. \\n\\nNeed-based aid is now all grants, no loans, so that&apos;s amazing in and of itself. A huge amount spent on Hey Day, Spring Fling, Homecoming, and more for alumni and students.  Cheap dental work at the Dental School. New expensive housing for people who want to live close to the school, but still the old dorm grad housing for those who don&apos;t want to do that.  Museums (the ICA and University Art/Archeology), and displays, plenty of speakers coming through the Kelly Writer&apos;s House and Irvine, or small preceptorials that introduced us to wines, dinosaurs, or cuisine in Philadelphia. A restaurant school just minutes walk away.\\n\\nAnyone remember Walnut Walk? Or Feb Club? Dances &amp; parties, frat houses and off-campus housing.\\n\\nI miss having everything so close. University City it may have been complete enough for the students to isolate them from the city, but it provided a very stable base to go wandering out to the rest of the city.",

Class sizes can be crazy huge for your standard chem, phys, econ, etc.  Competition is also pretty high so it can be daunting.  Profs here ranged from accessible to inaccessible.  At the time, Penn Course Guide was good to rate profs so you know what you are getting yourself into.  Now, I&apos;m sure there are online reviews for classes.\\n\\nLIBRARY- GENERAL COLLECTION, ILL, EZ-BORROW, PRINTING (5 out of 5)\\n\\nI can&apos;t complain except for the price for borrower&apos;s access as alumni.  As a student, it&apos;s great but sucks to be an outsider like alumni.  Catalog is pretty huge here and if you can&apos;t get it here, librarians can get it for you.  Printing basically sucks now.  Before, I remembered as an undergrad printing everywhere was free with your tuition/fees.  Now, it&apos;s nickel and dime you by charging your Penn card like a copy card.  \\n\\nGYM- REC CENTER, SWIMMING POOL, CLASSES (4 out of 5)\\n\\nWow, this place is HUGE.  Pottruck is much larger than I remembered when I was an undergrad.  However, the fees will bite you in the butt since it&apos;s optional for grad students.  The outdoors rec center is pretty decent with outdoors climbing clinics.  I found it to be pretty reasonably price and good experience.  Pool is really nice here as well.  Tons of cardio equipment here as well as class rooms for yoga/zumba/etc.\\n\\nBURSAR&apos;S OFFICE/BOOKSTORE (2 out of 5)\\n\\nA bit of a nightmare for registration.  Alot of red tape from dept to Eng school to Registrar&apos;s Office.  It helps to have patience when registering a course outside your dept.  Overall, not the most pleasant experience and tuition here is pretty steep.  I soon realized after getting the bill- at least my company paid for it.  I had to study like hell for the course to do decent in the class- still it was a tough grad course.\\n\\nCAREER SERVICES (5 out of 5)\\n\\nI used career services in the past as an undergrad for on-campus interviews from neighboring companies.  However, I think I have benefited more now with their counselors and mock interviews.  The staff here is great and very accommodating.  There are counselors for each school- Eng, College, Dental, etc.  So, they specialize in all areas which I haven&apos;t found from other schools.  Easy to get help over the phone or onsite and help out alumni as well.  I can&apos;t say enough that this place is just a huge asset when it comes to career search/development.\\n\\nVERDICT (4 out of 5)\\n\\nI can&apos;t say that I loved being a student here.  It&apos;s stressful even taking a grad course.  However, education wise it is probably the most challenging in my mind.  I had some really great profs who saw my perserverance and kept me afloat when I felt it was unending battle ahead.",

Van Pelt also has a quiet graduate student area that you can swipe your Penn card to get into, as well as a new reading room (located just as you walk into the library - to the right), and beautiful views of the city.\\nThe graduate student community here is also a definite plus!

We had Amazing time! our instructor was very fun lively &amp; interactive. She made my girlfriends  birthday party one she won&apos;t forget!  We were walked thru how to do everything, she made time for us to enjoy each other while painting. it was an amazing time. they really worked with us to make it a time we won&apos;t forget. She definitely deserves more then what she&apos;s paid. They gave her a free painting for her birthday and a birthday card canvas. I love this place!!!",

We painted in the blacklight for about 90% of the time and the music playlist was fun n upbeat. The place itself is new and has a great view of the stores in the plaza and even Philly. Pinot&apos;s has so many other options that other paint events &amp; places at comparable prices. They even have a truck to take things mobile. If youre looking for a different kind of paint party where you&apos;ll be happy with the results and have a fantastic time, then this is the place to go to. Thank you to Rosa &amp; Tre Thomas who have a beautiful establishment and ensured a great time!",

But I was lucky to have the opportunity to stumble upon PlayArts for my friends&apos; daughter 1st birthday party yesterday. The building of PlayArts is interesting as it used to be a historical public bath but it&apos;s converted into a children&apos;s activity center. The entrance to PlayArts on Front Street was a bit confusing as I had to go to the back entrance on Lee Street. But the staff didn&apos;t really communicate it properly and I had to call my friends who were hosting the event for directions to the birthday party entrance. The back entrance for the event has multiple shoe cubbies where you can put your shoes in. Then I entered a spacious room which was where the birthday party was in with a very long picnic table and birthday decor. What was very notable for me was seeing staff interactions with the children and how kind, genuine, and engaged they were with the child attendees in the birthday party. PlayArts seems like a great spacious place to customize into any theme and definitely is a great place to host events for children! Thanks PlayArts :)",

I&apos;ve been wanting to attend a drop in play session for a while, but when PlayArts held a special mini photo session in collaboration with a local photographer, and free play after the photos, I jumped on the deal!\\n\\nWhile not part of the normal business operations, the mini photo session was amazing - in a private room in the back, plenty of time for my daughter to feel comfortable and get a number of amazing photos. \\n\\nThen we moved to the play space and let my toddler go wild! The space is truly safe and entertaining for crawling babies through older elementary aged kids, with areas only the older kids could access and plenty to keep the younger kids entertained. We spent a solid hour, my child had a ball, and she was exhausted and took a loooong nap afterwards. \\n\\nI&apos;m so happy we have a space like this in Fishtown, and we look forward to more playtime!\\n\\nThey also are available to hold private parties, and it&apos;s definitely a space I&apos;ll consider as my child gets older and we have parties with other kids attending.",

With exposed brick and some new skylights, the inside is airy and bathed in light even on a rainy day. The interior is well conceived and has a very modern Scandinavian industrial esthetic with a couple thin bright neon metal trees perched in the main play space.\\n\\nThere are at least a dozen separate play spaces with duplos, train tracks, dress up, magna-tiles, fuzzy green &apos;grass&apos; reading nook, little trikes, play kitchen, climbing castle and a two floor play house, along with a little crawling hideaway. The toys on the whole, seemed to be sourced part Etsy, part Ikea, part Melissa and Doug, along with tons of European imports like HAPE and Plan toys.\\n\\nThere&apos;s a classroom in the back for classes, parties and a variety of specific kiddo activities. There are entrances both at the front and back of the building and there is an observation elevated space dedicated for snacking, for working and most importantly, for coffee drinking. The snack/coffee area is on an honor system (which I love - yes, we are adults!), offers a variety of kid friendly snacks (not just junk, unless you consider pirate booty, junk? ha!) beverages, along with Perrier and coffee (did I mention, there was coffee?)  Yes, there is coffee. Thank god.\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, the place is packed on weekends and especially on rainy days. As far as the age group it appeals to, my preschooler finds it lots of fun, although the majority of the population that I have observed in there is younger.  When the space is in fully over-run, staff could make efforts to better organize the space, and there should be perhaps labels as to what&apos;s where, or where things should go? (would that ruin the whole look?) The house and castle have some perilous stairs/ladders that require more parents oversight (helicoptering?) than I would like and I wish there was a tumbling section or a little climbing wall so we could really tire the kiddos out. Without a membership, you are out $12 per walk-in visit per kid. Much better play space than the underground Nest downtown.",

And PlayArts nails it. From the moment you walk in, you&apos;re greeted in a nice, clean reception area by PlayArts personnel who explain to you the concept, the rules of play, and the pricing scale. We initially decided to visit just for the day, but midway through our visit, I decided to go with a monthly plan. The kids had that much fun.\\n\\nHighlights include: tons of interactive toys, play areas for older toddlers as well as kids as young as a few months old, cool seating areas for parents, the snack/coffee/tea mezzanine area, the cash-free policy, etc.\\n\\nThis past summer, we held our son&apos;s birthday party here as well. And it was awesome. Both the kids and parents had a great time. I could base my 5-star review entirely on the party because it was that excellent of an experience: from booking, to communication with PA staff, to the execution the day-of. I have a feeling it won&apos;t be our last party there!",

After coming here a few times I decided that we had to become members! I&apos;m so glad I did. The first fridays are awesome and it&apos;s BYOB so you get to have a few drinks while watching your little run wild lol! Very clean, welcoming and relaxed environment. The staff are always friendly and welcoming to my family. Usually when we go we&apos;re there all day and when it&apos;s time to leave my son has a fit! So glad I found this place. No charge for parents which I think is awesome! And for former Chesnut hill Nest members (they recently closed down and I thought my world would end) this place is awesome. With winter quickly approaching and having a very rambunctious 2 year old little man this will be our new home and I am very happy about that! Thank you Play Arts! You da bomb!!",

They provided the decor, cups, plates, water, etc. It was nice not having to worry about all that. You can bring your own food and drinks and they will set it up/clean it up. Party room is huge.

            "description": "This review is about hosting a birthday party there. The good: play space is spacious and fun with good music; can do a private rental. The bad: for all the money we paid we expected a stress free party. Unfortunately, the two &quot;helpers&quot; that were there were not well trained. They were polite but did not know where to place food or how to host. Most of the food and drinks stayed downstairs even though most of the parents were upstairs. They kept asking me what to do even though i was busy trying to keep up with the birthday toddler while trying to speak with some of the guests at least. This included very common sense things like should we serve cake before or after pizza. They  spent most of their time talking to each other in the back instead of ensuring the party was running smoothly. The birthday girl did not have a central seat at the table and ended up with trash in the back ground of her photos. And the list goes on. So while the space is cool,hosting a party there is stressful as you provide all the food and do the hosting and only get very basic decorations (no themes) plus plates/cups with little help and no guidance. They even charge for ice despite the hundreds you&apos;ll spend. Hopefully they&apos;ll come up with better packages and trained staff in the future.",

She didn&apos;t want to come alone at night so I would accompany her to her classes. \\n\\nMy cousin went here from 99-2001 and many other family members. So I suppose we have a long standing relationship with this school and it is a great University with two campuses or more in NJ. I can&apos;t speak for thier athletics department because Rutgers football program gets beat by everyone and I&apos;ve only gone to one female basketball game. But the education is one of the best in the state. \\n\\nThis campus sits on the waterfront in Camden NJ, one of the roughest parts of south jersey, but they do an excellent job of keeping the campus clean and safe for students. I&apos;ve never known any of my 7 family members that graduated from Rutgers to ever have issues.",

I had gone to Newark Rutgers and they had no collaboration with the other rutger&apos;s so when I needed something it was annoying.  Here it is not the case they work well with the other rutger&apos;s and it makes things a breeze.  I am living in the graduate dorms at 330 cooper and I have to say they are gorgeous they are four bedroom suites and 4 separate bedrooms with a large living area and two bathrooms to share.  I have not been to any classes yet but have met with a lot of my teachers and they all seem very professional down to earth but professional which is what you want from a professor.  I am very glad they accepted me to come here because I have only been here a day and am amazed at this place.  They make you feel like you are at home with the massive campus all the amenities and security like you wouldn&apos;t belive.  If you are looking to finish your degree or try and get another I would recommend this campus.  This is a subjective view as I go here.",

            "description": "I&apos;ll apologize ahead of time for my lengthy review; however, I feel it&apos;s necessary to provide in depth details of my negative experience with hopes it could possibly help another family considering using this company for their infant care needs. \\n\\nI&apos;ll start off by offering some general advice for any potential customer considering using  Virginia is for Doulas. First and foremost, I would most definitely consider getting a written description of what a doula can or cannot do. The scope of my needs stayed relatively constant over a period of a few months. Unfortunately, Tiffany (the owner) changed her mind several times as to what her doulas could or could not do and as a result, we had to look for help elsewhere at the last minute. As mentioned, this changed several times based on Tiffany changing her mind alone.  \\n\\nSecondly, a written copy of their sick policy is a must. Decide on whether you want your infant/child exposed to a sick doula. In our particular case, our son is a preemie. We verbally requested that any sick doulas should stay home to avoid any issues for our son and his weakened immune system. Our doula was sick and our pediatrician recommended that she not return to work until 48 hours had passed after starting antibiotics. Tiffany still charged us for those particular days of our doula being sick. Even after, our doulas health continued to decline and she had to miss work for almost a week. Clearly it was a terrible idea for her to work due to her own sickness, let alone work around an infant with a weakened immune system to begin with. As a result, our entire family got sick that ended in multiple doctor visits and medications just from being exposed to our sick doula.  \\n\\nAnother clarification that is extremely important is what happens when your doula can&apos;t come into work. Not only limited to being sick but for any reason they can&apos;t make it to work. On multiple occasions my family was left in a predicament where fill-in support was not provided. There were several instances where we never even received a text, phone call or email from Tiffany or anyone for that matter about the status of finding a replacement. We had to sign up with a completely different agency that could provide back-up help for our family at the last minute.  \\n\\nAside from all the frustrations listed above, the lack of professionalism on Tiffany&apos;s part was the most unsettling of all. I&apos;m a fairly open-minded person. I realize mistakes happen. No one is perfect. However, I wasn&apos;t expecting Tiffany&apos;s unprofessionalism with regards to my genuine concerns. I was caught off guard by her rudeness and condescending attitude as if I had no reason to be upset. In many responses from Tiffany directly, it was almost as if I was being blamed or at fault for how those given situations were handled and I was offended. Both my husband and I have 25+ years of consulting experience with a strong background in client management and customer service. Tiffany could benefit from improving the way she handles interpersonal communication with her long-term clients. While she was cordial and pleasant for the first few months, over time her attitude went from pleasant to disrespectful and ill-mannered in all forms of communication. Not something you&apos;d expect from the owner of the company. Her behavior and way of handling certain situations caused me to want to cut ties with her on many occasions, but I remained a long-term client because of one particular doula named Summer. \\n\\nWe adored Summer because of her compassion, her knowledge and her love for what she does and for all the babies she cares for. Had it not been for Summer, we wouldn&apos;t have remained clients for as long as we did. \\n\\nI&apos;m hoping this review will help anyone who reads it and is considering going the route of hiring a doula and using this particular company. I&apos;m simply being honest about my family&apos;s personal experience and I genuinely wouldn&apos;t want anyone else to be put in some of the situations we were or be spoken to in the manner that we did.",

Tiffany and her team are extremely knowledgable and were helpful and supportive during my entire pregnancy through the delivery and post partum. I researched and considered other doulas in the area, but booked them after my initial phone consult because Tiffany was so friendly and informed, I knew I&apos;d be in good hands. I ended up having an emergency early induction and was so glad to have Tiffany as my doula providing pain relief and support during what could have been a scary delivery - thanks to her help, my baby was born smoothly and I recovered faster than I did with my first child.\\n\\nThe package we chose also included birth photography and follow up birth announcement photo shoot; other doulas try to double as birth photographer but I&apos;m glad they provided a separate photographer so the doula can focus without having to multitask. My photos came out beautifully and I&apos;m glad we&apos;ll always have them to remember this special time. My husband and I also attended the birth expo they hosted which was informative and full of freebies. If we have another baby, I will definitely book them again in the future! Thank you Tiffany!",

Kara and Tiffany were my doula teammates, and I had the great fortune that both of them were able to attend the birth. I had been fairly apprehensive about being able to VBAC but with the support of my team I did it, with a 8 lb baby, no less. Having the kind of triumphant birth I did made for a much better transition to new motherhood than with my first (emergency c-section).

Heather was on call and was there for most of my labor.

Leaving my daughter here is like leaving her with family. I cloth diapered, sent breast milk, and now organic milk, and homemade baby food for my daughter with no complaints from them. The low turnover rate allows my child to feel comfortable going there and I can work without feeling worried or guilty. Days that I&apos;ve had to go to work early they adjust their schedule and took her earlier (as early as 5:30 a.m.).\\n\\nI would change nothing about this childcare center. Someone could offer me free childcare elsewhere and I would not take it. I&apos;ve tried every daycare in town, licensed in-home providers and babysitters. None compare to Bright Start. There aren&apos;t enough stars to rate how I feel about them!",

The grammar and spelling made it feel like my brain was walking across a field of sharpened Lego pieces. I mean, there&apos;s a spell checker on Yelp and most computers/phones that you would write a review on have spelling and grammar checks that would literally take less than a minute to complete. Anyway, the college here is best described as cows grazing in a field. They&apos;re eating and moving around but not really doing anything or going anywhere. There&apos;s a few professors here who are diamonds in the rough but most should have spent their education careers at a daycare thanks to their insatiable egos and apathy. I went here for my basics to stay close to friends and family but eventually got tired of the lazy administrative staff that could care less about whether you enroll or get benefits and moved on to a standard four-year for my BA. I actually had to pay for one of my semesters out of pocket because they incorrectly submitted my VA benefits in spite of me working with them. After speaking to several classmates over the year and change I was there, I came to realize that my experience was a pretty regular occurrence with many, not just vets. Never in my entire life have I seen employees who care so little about their job or their clients and will do anything to get out of doing work. Sure, you&apos;re greeted with a smile, a handshake, and some wonderful sounding promises, but behind all that shallow fluff, you&apos;re being dismissed in the minds of the faculty and staff.",

            "description": "HAUNTED HOUSE  This is not for the college per say..My husband me and my children went here last night for their Kids Bash.. Although I know several of the people that attend this university, You were unable to see their faces because it was so dark, they had masks on and were painted up. We had to take a hayride into the &quot;woods&quot; (the haunted house was on campus) Then you had to get off and walk across the broken down bridge. Finally you get to the house, its all black and all you can see is flashing lights. Our tour guide told us to stay close and dont get lost. When we first walked in it was a guy just lying on a couch with a knife in hes chest. Pretty funny if you ask me, he was trying to be slick and scare everyone by waking up. You couldnt see where the hell you were going so I have no idea who or what was in front of me and suddenly SMACK a freaking doll hit me on the head. They had dolls hanging by there necks suspended from the ceiling. The next room that was lit up was of a women vampire, she didnt do anything but smile, so she sucked!! We went on this damn bus, I didnt even know we were on a bus till our tour guide yelled &quot;watch your step were getting off the bus now&quot;. What I was freakin out when the hell did I get on this bus???Next we went across another bridge and of course people were grabbing your legs, which was pretty funny because im so ticklish. But we get off the bridge and were in what looks to be a Forest, trees everywhere I lost my husband somewhere in the damn forest so im freaking out, IM LOST!! Suddenly all you could hear is roaring chainsaws all around me and Star,(my oldest daughter) as she had stayed with me.  They started chasing us, my daughter started screaming so I had to hold her all 40 pounds of her and make my way through this forest. Whomever it was they thought it was pretty funny and started poking me and her with the damn prop. Im not going to lie I was scared shit less. I should have gotten high before going in there!! Finally after running to catch up with my husband I fucking pushed him so hard into the damn wall, now that was funny!!!! I couldnt tell you what was after the forest because I just closed my eyes and hoped it would be coming to the end very soon. We finally got out of the house, and making our way back to the old ass bridge to cross that and go back on the hay ride one of the guys with the chainsaw started chasing me and Star again. He/She didnt go after my husband nor the others. My husband was rolling with laughter. So im wondering if it was someone we knew. He wont tell me. But it was pretty fun.. Worth the trip down there to see!",

He explains everything very well. He refuses to let students fail. He will continue to help you until you reach your potential. He&apos;s also a really great person to talk to if you are needing academic advice or just an adult to share your feelings with if you don&apos;t have anybody to talk to. He&apos;s the best teacher I could&apos;ve asked for when going to the Cabot schools. \\n\\nThe location on the map might make directions to the best class in Cabot a bit hard to find. Just stop into the main office and ask for directions to the best teacher ever and they&apos;ll point you the right way.",

Prices are extreme for under 42&quot;, at $7 and above 42&quot; is $8. WTH? Only $1 for kids?  Would be better if there was another tier or a bigger gap between the two prices. Infants to 1yo are free. They offer military discount, so be sure to show your ID when you pay ($1 off admission).\\n\\nThere is a kiddie area, red slide that is todder friendly, diving board and two bigger slides (must be over 42&quot;), and a lazy river. \\n\\nPlenty of seating around the pools.\\n\\nBreak times are listed so you know when they will be telling everyone to get out for a rest break.\\n\\nSnack bar prices are a bit high, but straight forward, highest is $4, cheapest is $1. They have an off brand Dippin Dots, Icee, nachos, hot dog, chips, etc.",

This is the third college I&apos;ve been to and by far the worst. The biggest reason I am leaving such an awful review is the fact that the financial aid office has refused to process my fafsa unless my parents commit tax fraud. They were separate at the time but the school wants them to refile as married not separate. I also owe the school a bit of money since scholarships didn&apos;t cover enough and fafsa wasn&apos;t processed so I had to solely rely on that. So I got a loan but I was told it wouldn&apos;t be active until the first day of classes. That means yet again my attempt to relieve the hold and register for classes was a bust. Next up is the food, the cafeteria seems to constantly under cook food. More specifically the chicken is almost always raw. And third is the teachers, but most specifically an english teacher named Mrs. Carter. Who gave me numerous zeros for assignments I turned in without any explanation why causing me to go from a B to an F in the last few weeks of classes. All in all I do not recommend attending this university.",

            "description": "Sarah was an absolute asset to my birth experience. This pregnancy was as a surrogate, which required me to give birth in a hospital, so I knew I needed a coach and an advocate. My first and only other birth of my daughter, was attended by 2 midwives at home and was the best day of my life. So, I hired Sarah and Charli for their doula services and was comfortable with either attending, just happy I knew them and they understood me and my birth plan. \\n\\nSarah showed up at our house right when the contractions kicked in. She guided me through them and made the call when it was time to walk to Providence Hospital. Along with my husband riding our cargo bucket bike and 9-year old daughter walking with me, we walked the 1/2 mile to the hospital, stopping every minute or two for me to lean against her and have a contraction. She provided me with shelter and guidance. When we got to the hospital, I was taken up to the birth center and learned I was 5 cm dilated and felt a sense of accomplishment. The final 5 occurred over 3 hours between the tub and the yoga ball in the bathroom. Sarah was my crutch during the hardest ones. My family doctor, who knew my birth plan well, showed up and they, along with the nurses, worked together to let me know it was time to get on the bed and push.\\n\\nI squatted in reverse on the bed, holding tight to the railings. With every push, I could feel baby Penelope make her way through the birth canal, with intense pressure. I asked Sarah to guide me through the ring of fire so I wouldn&apos;t tear. We took it slow, allowing the head to crown, stop, head halfway out and back in, stop, head out, stop, shoulder out, stop, arm out, stop and then her body fell gracefully to the bed between my legs. I scooped her up, the nurses helped me untangle from the cord so I could turn around and sit with her. They toweled Penelope off, I scooted over and her new mama came over crying and sat next to me and I got to hand over the most beautiful thing in the world to the person who had wanted her most. I looked up at the room and everyone was smiling and taking in the moment, including Sarah. This was the most magical day of my life.\\n\\nI can&apos;t recommend her and Charli enough. Having a doula or midwife is a serious luxury in giving birth and I also attribute my fast recovery (casually walking and biking within a week) to them. I needed no epidural, emergency treatments or stitches.",

            "description": "If you are on the fence about home or hospital birth, go with home birth! And go with this rockstar goddess duo of Hearth and Home to lead you through. It is one of the best life decisions I have made. Ladies, we have been designed for this, and we have successfully been having babies at home for thousands of years. Every woman who isn&apos;t high risk should give serious thought to birthing at home. Give yourself the credit that your body and mind are equipped for home birth. \\n\\nI have two beautiful children and two completely different birth experiences. My first son was born in the hospital, to make the long story short, I ended up being talked into an epidural and experienced a very chaotic 36hour long labor. Fast forward 9 years later, I wanted a different experience. I chose Sarah and Charlie, and I am so incredibly thankful I did. This time my birth was at home, in comfort and tranquility, with my partner and these two incredibly knowledgable ladies. I felt safe, I trusted their guidance. My son was born within 6 hours and by midnight Sarah and Charlie tucked us into our bed safe and sound with our son.\\n\\nI really value how these two handled every step of my pregnancy. Tho I was low risk, I did end up with gestational diabetes. We were able to figure out how to control my blood sugar with diet, while I would have been told to go on insulin, had I followed through with Kaisers recommendations, a drastic measure for something that ultimately was controlled with diet. I always felt they made time for me, and were very attentive the entire pregnancy. I felt like we were their only clients! \\n\\nI also love them as a team, their personalities work great together and really makes the environment one of &quot;we are all in this together&quot; . That being said, when it came down to the birth itself, Sarah and Charlie had this great way of being there, but not being there. They always stepped in right when I needed that female guidance, but let my boyfriend and I share the experience together as well. That is how I wanted it, I loved that they made a plan with us ahead of time. The exact opposite I had in my hospital birth experience. \\n\\nAfter my birth in the hospital, with doctors I had never seen, bright lights, medication and stress, I felt defeated and down on myself for how powerless I was in the whole experience. My birth with Sarah an Charlie at home by my side was the most polar opposite experience. I was empowered, energized, calm and in control. I have never felt more like a real woman warrior than I did in that experience. These two supported and challenged me, guided and let me lead. We are forever changed by and grateful for Charlie and Sarah. We whole heartedly recommend Hearth and Home. They are the real deal, total B.A&apos;s of birthing!",

We decided to enter under their care for our first child after having been with Providence Women&apos;s Clinic for our first half of pregnancy. We were immediately relieved and energized by their loving and professional approach to patient care. They were not only easily accessible every step of the way, they created an environment that truly amplified the needs and desires of the pregnant family. I can&apos;t imagine going back to any other kind of care for future pregnancies and births. Charli &amp; Sarah engage in deeply meaningful and skillful ways for any curve or bump in the road that can come along (and they always do!). I can&apos;t say enough about how wonderful they are and I hope you have the blessing of working with them like we did.",

I told them at my first appointment &quot;I want to do everything the same!&quot;. Ultimately I named my 3rd daughter after them! (No joke, her name is Charli Jean; Jean is Sarah&apos;s middle name). I felt completely supported, and never judged. I couldn&apos;t even tell you what their opinion is on most topics because they don&apos;t push their agenda. They state facts and evidence and then tell you ultimately you know your body and should make decisions best for you. If you are looking for a home-birth midwife please, please, PLEASE go and at least talk to these ladies! You won&apos;t regret it",

I have never felt more comfortable and safe at any health appointments in my life. I look forward to each appointment as they look at the mother and baby as a unit, and they make time to address any concerns or questions from the mother. I never feel rushed, always feel respected, never feel like a decision is being made for me, and I always feel heard. \\n\\nEven if you aren&apos;t using their midwifery services, I HIGHLY recommend their birthing class. My husband and I were thrilled with the entire experience. We both agreed that this class was well-structured and provided us an increased sense of peace and excitement around pregnancy, labor, and post-partum. We both feel like they touched on so many things that we hadn&apos;t learned about in the books, documentaries and articles we have been diving into on our own. I appreciate the in-depth look they provided on what is to be expected in each stage of labor. The entire class was structured perfectly and allowed for questions and conversation. I 100% recommend this birthing class and 100% recommend Hearth and Home for Midwifery as well.",

            "description": "I can&apos;t say enough about Sarah and Charli.  They are amazing!  My husband and I had been through two births before--our older daughter was born in a hospital, our younger daughter at home.  When I found out I was pregnant with baby #3, I knew I wanted another home birth.  I was so thrilled to find Sarah and Charli--a midwife team here in Hood River (vice Portland, which is where we traveled for baby #2 prenatal appointments).  \\nSarah and Charli are such a great team--they were supportive and knowledgeable throughout my entire pregnancy (to include helping identify supplements to help relieve a nagging cough I developed during the third trimester and providing a sounding board when I got worried about baby&apos;s movements slowing down, which turned out to be what I expect was a big growth spurt!)  I had a history of going pretty long with my pregnancies--daughter #1 was born 14 days after her due date and daughter #2 was 16 days after her due date--but even as I passed the 40 and 41 week marks with my son, I never felt any sort of pressure to &quot;get things going&quot;.  They really seem to embrace the fact that babies will come when they are ready and that it is a natural process that will just happen when the time is right.\\nWhen I finally did go into labor (I think I was actually in labor at an appointment with them, but pretty much in denial about it since it wasn&apos;t very intense yet and only 9 days past my due date), they were supportive and responsive.  When they arrived at our house, they seemed to have an efficient system for getting everything set up.  They were present when we needed them but gave my husband and me space to get into our groove as he coached me through contractions.  When it came time to push (definitely my least favorite part of labor), they gave encouragement and guidance, and I think I also may have squeezed the blood out of the hand they gave me to hold (sorry, Charli!)  After experiencing a significant tear with baby #2, I was worried about the same thing happening again.  But Sarah and Charli helped me breathe baby out this time--what an empowering experience!  And I didn&apos;t need any stitches! \\nSarah and Charli were so awesome, and I really recommend a home birth.  After my daughter was born in the hospital, I was so completely exhausted, but I wanted so much to hold and snuggle her that I ended up trying to stay awake so I could do so (hospital rules--no sleeping with baby).  Having a baby at home means you can eat whatever you want during labor, rest/sleep with baby, drink a beer and eat pizza after baby arrives (heck yes I did!) and just feel like you own your experience.  It has taken me far too long to write this review, mostly because life with three kids is just total chaos.  But it is with absolute enthusiasm that I recommend Hearth and Home--these ladies are the best!",

I have always known that I wanted to be a Mama and have a big family, that I had so much love and life to share with the universe. I was diagnosed with Von Willebrands at 6 years old, I was told to forget about having children. Having a full blown bleeding disorder hindered me and created big fear. No sports, playing at recess, internal bleeding, transfusions and for many years the idea of experiencing a pregnancy and birth of my own. When I turned 17 my Dr told me that, with new medical knowledge, I could have a successful birth in an extremely controlled environment. No alternative laboring and birthing positions, in bed, the no&apos;s and blood disorder caused me to have a postpartum hemorrhage with my first birth. The fear and anxiety we had around birth was so unnatural, so clinical, so stressful. It Made all the kicks and magic riddled with fear. My next two births in hospitals were much better. I had amazing doulas and wonderful doctors and so much more knowledge about motherhood, birth and my body. Von Willebrands taught me how to advocate for myself and my health. I have always been fairly &quot;granola&quot; and I dreamt of birthing at home. I knew I was capable, My husband knew I could do it, but not many physicians did. Medicine is so much about fear and control these days, there is little self advocacy, and there just isn&apos;t enough support for women&apos;s health. After I was served so many &quot;no&apos;s&quot; when it came to my choice in birth, with the love and support of sisters near and far, after tears, and so much determination, I met the amazing Charli and Sarah. They heard me, they saw me, and they believed in me. They saw my strength, my ability, my knowledge of self. They listened to me through tears, smiles, blood, love and birth. They hugged my children close. They encouraged both My husband and I through birth and new life. With laughter, quiet, and care they left their magical imprint on all of our hearts. I couldn&apos;t be more honored to have them both by our sides as we welcomed Our fifth baby home. With full hearts and gratitude we recommend Hearth and Home.",

            "description": "My children have been happily attending Minnetonka Montessori for a total of 4 years now, the oldest having moved onto elementary school.  They love/ed going to school there.  It is a warm and nurturing environment, as the teacher really gets to know the strengths and interests of each student and guides them in their exploration of many topics.  They learn how to interact with peers and direct their own learning.  Your child is not held back by the rest of the class if they are ready to advance further on a topic, such as geography, reading, mathematics, etc. . . Nor is a student left floundering or excluded if they are not ready to learn something.  The instruction is truly personalized to the individual student.  There is also a wonderful music class each week.  A real sense of community.  It is not a daycare or play-school.",

However the actual treatment aspects were not  great what so ever. They barely teach you how to handle your emotions and feelings. The staff recommended a wilderness program because I was not doing well in their program. I was not able to do well because they didn&apos;t teach me anything and were less than helpful. The school is barely a school but the teachers are kind. Now I can&apos;t say how well the program is doing  now since it has been such a long time. But I hope they have put some changes into the Managment as well as their therapeutic aspects.",

            "description": "I am a very private person that shuns social media and normally would not post anything on Yelp or any other site.  However, my wife and I read reviews regarding &quot;therapeutic&quot; boarding schools during a very stressful and troubling time when we had no answers at home (whatsoever) and seemingly no options with my increasingly troubled teen daughter.  The Yelp reviews (both positive and negative) about Greenbrier Academy were really meaningful in compelling us (as a family) to visit and consider the program as an option and so - after my daughter graduated from a year-long program a few months ago, I am writing this review during a Parents weekend at her new college-prep school where she is absolutely glowing and thriving.  My daughter&apos;s hard work and desire for a better life coupled with the Greenbrier Academy program and excellent staff (everyone at the school) made this all possible.  Worth every penny.\\n\\nAs you read these reviews, please understand that the GBA therapy curriculum focuses on the entire family dynamic (and not just the troubled teen girls).  This seems to be an unwelcome surprise to some parents who are simply unwilling to admit the part their behavior plays in an unhealthy home environment that is often the root cause of teen trouble.  If you are a parent and you do not love your kid enough to drop your ego and work just as hard via therapy to change your own destructive behavior then do everyone a favor and admit this up front.  Greenbrier can handle the rest if you do the work and admit that it&apos;s time to listen to experienced professionals construct a customized treatment plan to help your daughter figure things out for herself and set her on the path for self-reliance.\\n\\nThere are no shortcuts unfortunately.  You have to do the work.  But the Greenbrier program and Mike Beswick&apos;s excellent and experienced staff make all the difference.  You can sleep well at night knowing that your daughter is safe and that the most important things in her life at this moment are being addressed in the most fair and impactful way possible.  The results speak for themselves.  Worth every penny.",

            "description": "Our daughter&apos;s experience at the Greenbrier Academy has been truly life altering. Our 16-year old daughter suffered from anxiety and depression, self harm and suicide attempts that lasted 4 years and worsened over time, despite many interventions and therapeutic assistance. When we decided to enroll her in the Survival Skills Wilderness program at Trails Carolina, it was because we reached the end of the road. We were afraid she would not reach her 17th birthday. Our daughter graduated wilderness with a renewed sense of self esteem and a positive perspective on life and life&apos;s worth. Going from wilderness to the real world would have been challenging still so we decided to enroll her in the short-term program at the Greenbrier Academy for Girls in West Virginia. It was the best decision for us and for our daughter. The Greenbrier Academy offers excellent therapeutic and academic programs with experienced teachers and seasoned therapists, people who deeply care about the girls and their academic and therapeutic success. The program is headed by 2 amazing directors: Head of Guidance, Michael Beswick and Academic Director, Lowell Galford. I cannot begin to express our appreciation and gratitude to these 2 individuals and their teams. Their level of care, their expertise, their experience and the efforts they undertook on behalf of our daughter were tremendous. They succeeded not only in encouraging our daughter to turn her life around and change her misguided perceptions and beliefs, but they also assisted the whole family to heal and reconnenct. Mr. Galford&apos;s guidance throughout was invaluable, especially towards graduation. Mike Beswick&apos;s ability to get deep into the core issues at the 3-day Parent Program is extraordinary. Having experienced the Parent Program he leads one can easily see why he is a master at what he does. You could literally see how these young women are finally able to understand how their skewed perceptions of themselves are at the core of their struggle. And you could also see how parents are finally able to look deep into themselves and their actions and understand how it affected their children. From day 1 to day 3 the turnaround happening in front of your eyes is magical (of course it takes many months of hard work beforehand). GBA also offers the &apos;Village&apos; experience where the girls spend time away from the main building looking deep into themselves and their value as human beings. Paul Fowler, the director who runs the Village experience is a most amazing master therapist. My daughter said the most impactful experience she&apos;s had at GBA was Village, guided by Paul. She had experienced it 3 times and it was the primary experience that helped her finally realize who she is and believe there is a purpose to her life. GBA parents are also supported and guided by a highly experienced Family Therapist, Greta Lutman, who is very capable at bringing opposing forces - parents who perceive things differently - to work together in an effort to assist their child. With the assistance of all these wonderful people our daughter was able to reconnect with herself and change her misguided perceptions. And we, as parents, were able to better understand each other and our child. It was a remarkable experience that turned our lives around. Our daughter has been home for less than 10 days now and she is submitting her college applications. She is highly motivated and is looking forward to her future - which is so heartwarming. Of course not every girl is able to turn her life around in a short 4-month program. I also cannot pretend that everything at GBA was perfect. I feel the school could benefit from being better organized, especially if a point person could be assigned so parents can bring in non-therapeutic issues and concerns. We had to be persistent and highly involved all along, especially towards graduation. But GBA&apos;s ability to tailor specific therapeutic and academic programs to each and every girl is really the basis for its success and maybe a certain level of disorganization is the outcome of that... It&apos;s a small price to pay in light of the tremendous success that can be achieved. We are grateful to everyone at the GBA for bringing us our daughter back to us, strong, positive and motivated!",

Psychiatrists, therapists, even hospitalization did nothing to help her. After spending 10 weeks in an outstanding wilderness program (SUWS of the Carolinas), she spent a year at Greenbrier. There aren&apos;t enough words to describe the outstanding staff. John Grago, Mike Beswick, Lowell Galford, Kelly Beasley, Rachel Call, LJ, Paul and Greta, Sarah and Angel each played a role in our daughter&apos;s transformation, and our family will be forever grateful. The African drumming program, Village, overseas service trip, parent programs and aftercare coaching program are all part of the magic of this very unique and special school. Our daughter is now thriving as a junior in high school and has discovered the lasting treasures of joy, purpose and gratitude. Her experience was so meaningful, she is now looking ahead at becoming a wilderness therapist. I cannot recommend this school highly enough for any family in need of help and healing. Thank you Greenbrier!",

As a parent I made a mistake of taking advice from an education consultent and a 8 week program helping my daughter deal with anxiety and depression .  She was NOT at risk for alcohol  or drug abuse . She did not lie or steal and she did not harm herself or anyone else.  I have heard from others that these &quot;Wilderness &quot; programs have ties to theraputic schools.  I am starting to believe this more than ever because her so called &quot;caring &quot; therapist recomended this knowing she was not at high risk.  According to my daughters current therapist she is suffering PTSD because of the trauma she was exposed to at Greenbrier .  PLEASE DO NOT LISTEN TO EDUCATIONAL CONSULTENT or &quot;WILDERNESS PROGRAM &quot; unless you want your daughter to suffer .  I suggest you try everything to find a good theraputic school if you must after trying everything else.  I can tell you Greenbrier is NOT a good one at all. I had a gut instinct to get my daughter out of there before the year .    The food was horrible , verbal and physical assaults by other students  was a reoccuring theme , there is no real education ( be prepared for your daughter to lose a year of proper education ) , theft is as normal as going to the bathroom there ! i forgot to mention for $90,000 a year my daughters therapist was NOT licensed .  This place is a scam and so was the program that ecommended it.  They take advantage of parents that would do anything for their children.  It makes me sick that this DISGUSTING place still operates!!!",

The facility is so clean and organized. It puts me at ease knowing our daughter is here with people who genuinely care about her development and her well being. They use Brightwheel and keep parents updated all day long! It is so easy to get in touch with them for any question or any kind of check in I have during the day. It really puts me at ease knowing I can be so in touch while away from our daughter !",

The owner told me not to return to work after being out for medical reasons over a 2 week period. I had 2 doctors notes for leave. She also told me to get another profession because of my disability. I only give 2 stars because some of the staff are amazing. They deserve better. The owner allows extreme behavioral problems in the classroom and does not allow teachers to tell parents. She is very ignorant of how or what to do with classroom management,  curriculum development,  staff training, budgeting etc... This is a BABYSITTING AND CRAFTS ONLY CENTER. Just spend time observing or asking questions. The owner is also very ignorant of DHS licensing guidelines. Just know you get a glazed and happy version of what is really happening from the owner. Good luck finding childcare. Just not here. Look on Better Beginnings.com to find 3 star childcare!",

However, there was one faculty member in particular (Dr. Tara Mishra in IT) who freaked many of us out and I have been wanting to complain about him for years, but kept my mouth shut, because he has this way of gagging people via subtle intimidation tactics. If he felt like you were under his spell, he would make disparaging remarks about woman, certain races and faculty members who seemed to be on his perpetual shit list. He would then add humor to his statements so it wouldn&apos;t seem too horrible. Regardless it was unprofessional and many of us lost respect for him. He was constantly making bizarre comments about how his computer is acting like so and so in the department, his ex - wife or how the system was as inefficient as the chancellor. Sometimes students heard him howling at people on the phone before he realized someone was outside his door. At times he would try to drag others into some drama he was instigating with other faculty or students. That was way out of line!! \\nIf you did not concur with him he would act like an over-inflated peacock and brag about his stellar academic history and position. This would be followed up by tales of his big shot professor brother from Australia who had powerful &apos;connections&apos; so he doesn&apos;t have to worry. I perceived this as if you don&apos;t play my game, I&apos;m going to seriously mess you up. \\nWell I will be leaving the country PERMANENTLY, off the grid for awhile so I am taking the opportunity to get this off my chest! If his big shot brother is that desperate to track me down for speaking my mind, he has more issues than &apos;Dr. Mishra&apos;. Dr. Tara Mishra, Its pathetic I have to use an alias to make this review, because I know he probably would track me down.\\nFuture students watch out for this guy! He will try to get to know you by finding out the troubles in your life and offering you saint-like assistance. If you make the mistake of telling him your problems or accepting help from him (I mean other than typical academic advising). He will carefully file all this information away and be especially nice to you. Gradually he will try to reel into some political game he is playing on campus. I have heard of him going as far as coercing people to outright lie for him (even in court). I believe he only does this to select people with whom he&apos;s been able to play on their vulnerabilities. I think that because many people who do deal with him have never heard or seen anything to give them a negative impression. If you want to have an academic relationship with him, your fine. He&apos;s pretty smart, but NEVER tell him about your sick grandma, your impoverished parents or ANY personal problems. If you do you will be the proverbial frog in water that gradually reaches boiling and become his puppet.",

During the corona virus pandemic they wanted to continue to charge all students full tuition ($1423 per month per child or $2846 total for our two kids). Our children are ages 2 and 4, and The New School essentially serves as an educational day care for our family. They would not offer a refund for the period of time that school was out so I got a lawyer involved. I have no problem paying for services as long as services are being received. They ultimately waived the payments in question, but I just found out today that they also cancelled our children&apos;s enrollment for the 2020-2021 year without our permission. We never asked to have the children removed from the school. The head of school (Nancy) will not even communicate with us directly anymore. When we reach out with questions about enrollment she simply says that only our lawyers can communicate going forward. \\n\\nWe have several friends whose children are there currently, and they are having similar issues. One couple in particular wanted to withdrawal from the school electively due to safety concerns surrounding the pandemic. Even though school has not officially started for the academic year, they were told that if they pulls out their children that they will still owe full contract price for the academic year (roughly $15,250 per child) because it is after July 1st. Hopefully, you are starting to get the picture. \\n\\nWe enjoyed the school itself and the teachers. I had no problems with the education component of the program. However, the money-driven nature of the school poisons the environment. It is not worth the ultra-high premium that they require for tuition. Maybe the K-12 experience is difference, but the contracts they have for the early childhood education is absurd. They are more interested in taking your money than doing what is right. \\n\\nI have since gladly taken my children elsewhere.",

But with work between my husband and I we had to get her in somewhere. Swiftly. But of course you can not trust just anyone with your babies. \\n\\nOur little one is very cautious when meeting new people. She&apos;s reserved. And not open at all to being around strangers. She&apos;s never been around a group of little ones or teachers alone. So this was super new for her and us. Of course for the first day-week she cried when we left her there. But as the first week was coming to a close we noticed a major difference. \\n\\nShe started talking about her &quot;friends&quot; and she wanted to &quot;go see the kids&quot;. Oh and her teacher...Ms. Janay! She is THE BEST! And she loves Ms. Keisha! All of the staff are kind hearted. Respectful. Welcoming. Loving. The right people you would want taking care of your child when you are not around. Also, and this may not mean much for some...but this facility is the most diverse facility I visited when shopping for childcare. I believe this is important and was indeed the biggest factor in our little brown girl feeling safe and secure. There were people there that looked like her own family at home. I can&apos;t thank them enough.",

My youngest 2 still attend. The teachers in the minnows room are gentle and loving. They work with the babies to do fun arts and crafts, teach them sign language, and cuddle and love them. My baby has never had a need that was not met. She is happy and excited when I drop her off at school. She&apos;s attended since 8 weeks and I&apos;ve never once had a complaint.\\n\\nMy 2 year old also attends Cadence. His teachers have the patience of saints. Toddlers are not always easy, and though I&apos;ve seen quite a few outbursts from the kids as toddlers will do, I&apos;ve never once seen a teacher raise her voice or lose patience. They love the kids and teach them structure, love, and acceptance. Ms. Kayla and Ms. Jessica in particular have been wonderful with my son and have worked with him and with us tirelessly during the &quot;joys&quot; of potty training. I recommend this place 100% and love it so much that we drive a half an hour each way just so my kids can attend.

You will not be taught by experienced professionals, you won&apos;t be taught much that will make you a serious competitor in your field, you&apos;ll have to do that yourself here. If you only want to learn the most basic and OUTDATED concepts of hair, with little guidance, this is the place for you. Not to mention a few of the staff members could really use a lesson on racial sensitivity. A lot of poor behaviour is let slide in this place, a lack of professionalism, and an uncomfortable environment for students of color. The price of tuition does not reflect the quality of education at all. I was overall disappointed.",

AOM takes the kids to the studio, sans parents, and we can watch them practice from the monitors in the waiting area. She enjoys class much better this way, as compared to our experience at another studio. Class is always on time, and her coach Cortney is really great. Costumes for recital are here well ahead of time, and of great quality. Overall, we have had an exceptional experience here, and highly recommend AOM!",

It&apos;s as if both students and faculty are trying to figure out how to connect online. \\n\\nI just want to make it possible to do it myself, but I&apos;ve got to navigate through a sea to meet the people before I can edit a schedule or change minds about majors.",

As I walk through the halls of any building I notice that the only things ever promoted consistently are organizations focusing on LGBTQ and women, a long with a few minorities here and there. Aside of that note, has anyone ever noticed how LGBTQ has there own parades and is clearly nurtured, but when it comes to Veterans Day or something that includes making the ultimate sacrifice there is little to nothing.",

Then these crooks send me a bill after the course time had expired and threaten collections for a class I never knew I was enrolled in.

            "description": "I attended this University during 2004-2005 so probably a lot has changed but my experience was pretty good. There were students from all over the country and all over the world. There was a class where I knew two people from high school and another friend named Paul. Most classes were lectures, which I like because I sit there and take notes and there&apos;s so many people that it&apos;s hard to start drama. My government class was in a theater and the person that sat next to me was the security at the art gallery and he was so nice. Some classes were small but they were fine too and I met someone from Detroit and we did group activities in that class and they went well, no disasters.\\n\\nAn advisor told me that even though the zoology department was gone I could still go to school and then my degree would show that I graduated with a degree in zoology. The last time I saw an advisor she told me that it was untrue. I failed biology twice (I know zoology major fails biology, but trust me I&apos;m better at animal sciences) and then gave up which is sad because I wasted so much opportunity and the scholarship I received and fell behind to the point that I&apos;ve been in an out of school, well when I moved to a new state the University said they couldn&apos;t find my transcript and I did read about the University losing school records, maybe now that digital has been around for a while they can find my transcript. I don&apos;t get the Razorback thing but I&apos;ve moved around my whole life so I don&apos;t get school spirit in general. I felt that this school (I could be wrong) was moving towards becoming a sports school or training place for future athletes, which is ok.\\n\\nAfter the head of NORML came to speak the NORML Representative at the University was expelled and a lot of people thought it was because the University wanted to lessen NORML&apos;s power or get rid of the organization.\\n\\nThis was the last place where I had solid friends but some people can become violent quick without any provocation, the cops used to stop my boyfriend and I every time we would walk to the store- never got violent thank God but it happened so often that one time a cop waved at my boyfriend, my boyfriend couldn&apos;t get a job as a bagger at a grocery store because he has long hair, there&apos;s also the whole clinics are bad and make women promiscuous. There are some people in the area that still have old-fashioned beliefs and it&apos;s not just the older generation but the older generation passes it on to the younger generation. If someone is not used to this then it can be a real shock, it was for me. I was forced to move to the area by my dad so the negatives were probably ten times worse. If I had a choice I would have gone back to my birthplace to finish high school and lived with my Grandma, not that there&apos;s anything wrong when I went to Fayetteville High School but that&apos;s another review.\\n\\nSorry this is so long I do that on Yelp reviews, I wanted to write this review because I wanted to write about a good school experience because on my other school Yelp reviews I come off as some kind of nutjob.",

However, I call it the hallway, where everything is done for registration and student debt. This &quot;hallway&quot; is full of difficulty and they make it hard to get things done. One person really helped me and she was able to walk me through every station. I realize everyone has their part in the process, but it gets tiring when everyone just passes you on to the next person over and over again. I feel bad because the lady that helped me I had a bad attitude towards at first, but she was literally the last person I spoke to after all the chaos. It&apos;s not an excuse to act that way and I feel bad for it. I just wish all the employees down that hallway were as proactive as she is. Hopefully things change next year and I can change my view on this school as a whole.",

            "description": "I attended this college online for their veterinary technician program.  The program itself was great, and the professors were amazing.  I attended the Fast Track labs where you good with the professors for a weekend with 11 or so other students at a farm in Texas and learn/perform your large animal skills.  I was super stressed out about it since all my experience in the field was with small animals, but they (Mrs. Black, and Dr. Wright) were great teachers and were very patient with us.  They are what all teachers should be like.  Sherry Hair, the academic advisor, was always very helpful whenever we had phone appointments, and you really feel like she cares about your success, just like the teachers do.    \\n\\nBut....  The school itself was difficult to work with.  These courses are very competitive to get into (which is understand). When the courses open up, you have to be by a computer to get a seat (especially towards the end of the program).  There were multiple clerical errors on my account that on 2 separate occasions caused me to not be able to enroll in the classes I needed on time. The system literally would let me put my courses in my &quot;cart&quot;, but would&apos;t let me enroll and told me to contact administration.  When I called them regarding the issue (the same day courses opened up), they told me that my mailing address was wrong (it wasn&apos;t, they&apos;ve been mailed me things in the past).  When I told them it was correct, they opened up my ability to enroll in the courses, but it was too late and the classes were full.  I had to monitor the seats every day until someone got dropped for non-payment.  \\n\\nTheir financial aid department messed up my aid EVERY semester.  FAFSA actually denied me aid once because they filled out the form so sloppily (that is actually when they told me, and they sent me copy of what they were sent).  Whenever I&apos;d called and no one answers, I&apos;d leave a message and never get a call back.  One week I called them three times and left messages every time, and I never got a call back.  When I finally got a hold of someone, they transferred me to someone&apos;s mailbox, and I&apos;d leave a message there only to be ignored there too.  Finally when I spoke with someone and told them that they messed up my paperwork, they told me to just come down next time to fill out the paperwork.  I live in Arizona.  The school is in New Mexico.  I shouldn&apos;t have to drive/fly 400 miles because they can&apos;t fill out a form correctly.  The last semester or two I didn&apos;t even bother applying for financial aid because of the hassle and put the tuition on credit cards because I&apos;d rather pay the interest than deal with them.  My last semester I had to call multiple times to get a hold of someone regarding my transcripts.  \\n\\nThe quality of this school (at least the veterinary technician program) is great, but forget it if you live in a different state.  You will have a hard time getting anything done if you have to call the front office for anything.  Whenever people ask me if they should look into this school for their certification, I tell them no and that the program is great, but the school itself is hard to work with and it&apos;s like pulling teeth to get anything done.  I have to give it 2 stars because if I had to do it over again, I wouldn&apos;t just because of the front office issues.",

This church is not a place where you just sit enjoy one service a week, but a place where you will always have opportunities to serve, give, and be a part of a community \\n2. It is totally focused on Jesus. Not a lot to explain other than that you can tell God is in charge and directs this church. \\n3. It is loving. People are so welcoming, and you can tell that this type of culture is led by the pastor who will always make sure to tell you that he loves you haha!\\n\\nAlso, massive renovations have been done recently that have really amped up the place; very diverse church in ages and cultures which makes it great for just about anyone.",

Everyone I have sent to them has always been impressed with the amount of help they provide them.  Not only do they prepare the teens for all the testing, but they also help them with their resumes, such that colleges not only just accept their applications, but want them to attend their college (providing scholarships and discounts).  In today&apos;s competitive market, it pays to have professional help to have all your options laid out for you.",

My instructor, Erik Hamlin, is just short of maniacally good at what he does. His energy was through the roof and he really livened up the oft-boring LSAT prep. The center is clean, modern and you feel like they really have their stuff together-- which was important to me considering how much I forked over for the classes! Like Elizabeth said, they don&apos;t have a private lot but there is a parking garage attached to the building and metered parking right outside (it&apos;s Coral Gables, they can&apos;t magically construct a parking lot out of thin air).\\n\\nThe front desk staff is comprised mostly of young girls whom would rather not be there, so if you have to interact with them keep it brief and be your own advocate. Do not expect them to know what you are talking about because 1) their iphones need attending to and 2) they have so many different classes offered that they just can&apos;t keep up!\\n\\nNevertheless, the materials are top-notch and if you are lucky enough to get Erik, you will be in great shape! When I decided grad school was where I really wanted to be I didn&apos;t lose a minute contemplating where I would prep for the GRE--you got it, Kaplan!\\n\\nP.S. The online components are second to none. Do yourself and your future a favor...you&apos;re on the comp right now! That&apos;s right!",

At first I was bummed because my class was moved here from the University of Miami, but I&apos;m actually really happy with the location. The only downside is the parking - you have to park either in the garage (which is attached to the building, so it&apos;s convenient) or on the street. It just bothers me that Kaplan doesn&apos;t validate parking (you can run across to Nordstrom and get a coffee at the E-Bar and get it validated, but then you still end up paying something for the coffee).",

Once you free yourself of the boundaries of the English language and rules that govern it, you will find Mandarin actually quite easy to learn and the Zhuyin method will provide you with the absolute correct method of pronunciation for the language. Pinyin&apos;s romanization of Mandarin causes native English speakers to mispronounce words and struggle with the tones. After learning Mandarin through Zhuyin, you will sound like a native speaker and have a fundamental understanding of Mandarin and all of its nuances (cultural and modern). I cannot recommend Wanda Shaw&apos;s program enough.",

Also I saw the other review and it said her kid was bullied. Thats only because the kid is a jerk. Some kids are jerks, teach your kid that thats life and to get over it.

We have sent our child to their camp on a couple of occasions without incident, she in fact enjoyed the experience. The latest time, she was teamed up on by a few other girls for being too loud and interrupting, something I had explained to the teacher she has a hard time controlling. When she verbally warned one of the other kids to stop, they sent her home for the rest of the week with no further warning, or remedial action. Surely, a kids words shouldn&apos;t be cause enough for expulsion, especially when they are only responding to organized criticism from the other kids. We will never, ever subject our kid to this kind of elitist environment again. And it is too bad, since there really isn&apos;t another theater option for kids in Huntsville. I think theater camp would be a great place for loud, assertive children. It was for me when I was a loud and assertive kid. Fantasy playhouse is just not able or willing to accommodate such children.",

While I was attending Dr. &quot;Sean Connery&quot; Williams was heading the school, and it has become apparent that the UAH board was all about the money. Forcing full time students to get a crappy meal plan and other such nonsense to support their add-ons. Meaning a half Chick-fil-a, and a gas station-like convenience. Nevermind chick-fil-a is a block away from the school so are gas stations. \\n\\nAnyways, it is just apparent that they need to work on their care of the students. I was lucky enough to have great starting advisers (Freshman - Sophomore engineering); however, liberal arts department is sorely lacking a great set of advisers.\\n\\nSchool isn&apos;t overly hard, but definitely harder than a community college and my attendance at UNA. I feel I got a great education despite the complaints above. The school has a lot of perks and cheap living expenses compared to some college towns. I would continue schooling there. Great place for internships.",

I guess its because I came from a small community college and I&apos;m just not used to this big of a work load.  The teachers overall are pretty good.  My Engineering Economy teacher is awesome!  But I have a Physics lab professor that speaks maybe 2 words of English and is horrible at giving instructions (which is pretty important considering its a LAB!!).  UAH has a lot of good clubs and activities but most of the people here are not as friendly as I have seen in most places.   But overall its a very good university, and they have great engineering programs here.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone.",

            "description": "I had a good experience at Calhoun back when. I attended Calhoun when they had satellite campuses all over the place. The main campus was (and I guess still is) in Decatur, and yes you had to attend a lot of classes there; however, they also had satellite classrooms on Redstone Arsenal, Huntsville High School and in &quot;THE Mall&quot; - yes where Barnes and Noble is now, only further down the mall - you had to hang a left at the western themed bar and it was on the east side of The Mall where Picadilly used to be. We always joked that if you leaned in closely enough to the cinder walls you could still hear the servers saying &quot;Serve you, Serve you please?!?!?!&quot; :D\\n\\nBecause high school was such a breeze for me and really did not prepare me for college, I started UAH with a whopping 1.0 and yes, academic probation my first semester. I had no idea you could drop a class and really did *not* think the professors meant what they said when they assigned voluminous amounts of reading/coursework with only a day or so to accomplish it, and I paid for it with terrible grades my first semester.\\n\\nEnter Calhoun! Calhoun to the rescue! I took classes all over north Alabama or at least it felt like it with part time college professors and full time ones, too. Anyway, it was still hard work; however the staff were friendlier than UAH, more accommodating to those of us who worked, and had more of a smaller, diverse group of students. I still learned and I learned a LOT at Calhoun!\\n\\nI managed to pull my grades up to graduate with two associates at cum laude and transfer back to UAH to do the same with 1 BA cum laude.\\n\\nThe tip for anyone planning to do a similar approach to getting a degree is to stay in touch with UAH and ensure each class and associated credit *will* transfer from Calhoun to UAH. To me, and I&apos;m sure to any college student, these hours are pretty much worth gold and you don&apos;t want to lose them! Also, don&apos;t be afraid to take any issues where a credit is denied to the Dean (or higher if necessary) to argue your case. Pay attention to the handbooks (if that&apos;s a thing anymore) and ensure the classes align in terms of course content.\\n\\nOh, and another good thing about Calhoun is you don&apos;t rack up 1000s of parking tickets by attending there.",

The tutors there are really friendly and will be patient with you to make sure you understand everything you need to know, whether it&apos;s for your math class or for tests like the ACT or SAT. No other tutor I&apos;ve worked with was nearly as helpful. Since i started going to Gables Tutoring, I&apos;ve been able to maintain an A in math and my SAT math section score has gone up more than 120 points... Highly recommend this place to anyone, whether you don&apos;t understand anything at all or just need someone to go over your homework with you!",

I was going nuts looking for childcare for my tiny baby when someone recommended this school. On my first visit, I knew this was the place for my baby. Clean, loving environment. Director Janice de Armas walks you through everything and is always patient with my &quot;new mommy&quot; questions. Also, She runs a tight ship as far as security measures go to make sure the campus is secure. The campus is gorgeous and has a good energy about it. Teachers are caring and very knowledgeable in their field. My son started at 2.5 months and is now a thriving, sociable 2year old, and I know ICS has played an important role in that.",

ICS Coral Gables and Janice De Armas, the director, are a big part of the reason my daughter has excelled in the way she speaks, behaves and continues to develop. Potty training our daughter has been the most difficult of tasks, ICS and Janice and her teachers stepped in to save the day. They have worked with our daughter and have been patient and caring with her needs. We are so incredibly blessed to have found this gem. I recommend this school to anyone with kids from newborn to 5 years old. Not only is it a great school, but the sense of family and community that they staff creates for the parents is bar none. Thanks ICS. We are forever grateful.",

From the moment we arrived we were treated poorly by staff. We were not greeted, not even asked if it was our first time or not. Not one staff member guided us on what we needed to do. I waited for a little bit and then decided to follow another parent who was dropping their child off. I saw that they wrote their child&apos;s name on a name tag so I did the same for my daughter. I then took her in and the teacher said in these exact words &quot;did you say goodbye to your daughter?&quot;. I then stepped back, nervous and worried that I might have made the wrong decision of handing my daughter to some strangers who did not even take the time to greet us and help us on our first time at this Gymboree. I stood out of the play area but stayed in the store looking in for a few seconds to make sure my daughter wasn&apos;t crying. Then suddenly another staff member pointed the door at me and said &quot;you need to leave now!&quot; I then said to her &quot;I&apos;m just worried about my daughter, it&apos;s her first time here and I just want to make sure she transitions well.&quot; The staff member then responded in a very cold matter; &quot;I cannot let the other kids see another parent in here.&quot; I was in total disbelief. I could not believe the way I was treated. I left the Gymboree class worried and stressed. I do not want to drop my daughter off next week and I am now regretting signing up for this month&apos;s membership.",

Nicole Goudie, the manager, was unbelievably rude to me when I came in with my daughter to make up a class we missed due to the hurricane. She wouldn&apos;t listen to me, talked over me, and then called me rude as I stood there embarrassed in the gym with my kid. When she finally stopped yelling at me and realized she was in the wrong, she didn&apos;t apologize. I was 20 mins late to the class because she accosted me... some &quot;make up&quot; class that was. \\n\\nNicole did the same thing to my friend when she had her kid&apos;s birthday party there -- accused her of &quot;talking over&quot; her while arguing and interrupting her customer. So disrespectful.\\n\\nApparently Nicole doesn&apos;t need to curb her attitude towards customers because she&apos;s the franchise owner&apos;s daughter and has job security through nepotism. So, I don&apos;t think things will change anytime soon. Best to go to another location not Goudie-owned (Kendall, Palmetto Bay, and Coral Gables) or try other places like Silly Monkeys Playhouse in Coconut Grove.",

Regardless of the rules I feel like an establishment for kids should have warm welcoming staff. I was very turned off by the lady&apos;s energy at the front desk and by the looks of it I&apos;m not the only one!",

I very impressed with the set up and enthusiasm of their employees. My daughter absolutely loved the class and we decided to join for the unlimited classes. She is in learn &amp; play 2. We tried a music class this past Friday and that was fun - it does include children of all ages. I liked seeing my daughter interact with older kids and how she handles different  scenarios. I looks like most of the bad reviews are older and they have worked things out. Someone mentioned they don&apos;t clean the toys - I saw our class leader, Ciara cleaning the toys in between classes. Definitely recommend this place!",

It was a great place for my second child to thrive due to the teacher that was there. She is no longer there and the turn over of teachers is just ridiculous! We have had more teachers than I could have ever imagined. Worst! If the teacher is sick, instead of the owner taking responsibility and covering the class , she goes ahead and cancels it . Then, I&apos;ve had the teachers tell me that they not only have to work in one location but, multiple locations during the week. Those poor teachers must be exhausted and you can see it in their faces . The number one thing that Gymboree does not have is, it does not cater to siblings. I have 3 kids and I can not have my older children sit alone unsupervised. There is no designated space for them, and no one to watch them. Sure, they can say the receptionist or front desk girl can watch them but, when a customer walks in or if they have to put up merchandise or go to the back whose going to watch the kids sitting alone ? It&apos;s terrible and I just don&apos;t recommend for any mommies out there with more than one child.",

We have move far from Coral Gables and, that is the reason we have to switch to another school. I highly recommend Gables Montessorri if you are looking for a safe, caring place to leave your little one every morning, and on top of this, a place where kids can become independent and learn a lot on a peaceful environment.

This is her passion and it shows in the quality of the school. My son had a difficult experience prior to his arrival and everyone on staff worked together to get him to where he needed to be. As they say it &quot;He is another child.&quot; I owned a Montessori for 20 years &amp; visited many in the area but this school had everything we were looking for &amp; more. A safe, loving environment, authentic Montessori school, where children can thrive. I&apos;d choose GMS over 1000 times if I had to choose again! Thank you GMS!!!",

We recently left to enter the more traditional public school environment, but my daughter was very prepared for kindergarten as a result of her time at Gables Montessori - from the independent thinking approach of Montessori instruction to the knowledgable teachers who delivered the lessons, I could not have asked for more. My daughter would consistently apply what she learned at home - from practicing words to wanting to lay out a mat on the floor for every home activity.  They also have real world activities, for example learning the ABCs required bringing an object in to demonstrate each letter, which was fun and helped us to supplement her learning.  They also have some activities which are different from other schools in the area - for example they have regular Mandarin language classes.  I also feel that they really focus on providing value to the family - not just collecting tuition payments. Other schools seem to place a lot of pressure on families to attend too many events and bring in food and supplies, but here they strike the right balance.  Ms. Maderlene really cares about her students and her families and bends over backwards to make sure the needs of every student are met, and the teachers are wonderful and truly take care of each child. My daughter made many friends there, and we miss the Gables Montessori family.  Highly recommend.",

We then were able to take the self guided tour, since the student led one was cancelled, due to Covid Delta infection rate. I am not sure how much sense that made, since we saw all the freshman congregating together, with some minor distance outdoors for orientation of sorts anyway.\\nThe campus is not as large as some others, yet large enough to be considered a large campus, if that makes any sense.\\nThe people were friendly and there were various dining options available. I would say we covered most of the campus, before we had to head to our flight back. There is just something about great sunshine, palm trees, and the tranquility that Florida brings to a University like UM, that can reduce the kids stress levels while studying.",

It was a fantastic experience from an academic and social perspective.\\n     Academically, the classes and Professors at UMiami are premium. The Professors were very knowledgable, but moreover truly caring to students. Even in larger classes, almost all professors went out of their way to know each student. It was not just a job or wage for them, it was a huge part of their lives. Even over a decade later, Professor Scharf, Professor Chester, Professor Alonso, &amp; Professor Schmidt made a lasting &amp; profound impact on my life.\\n     Socially, this a school that is accepting of all cultures and lifestyles. No matter what your race or lifestyle choice, there is always a place for you at UMiami. This is particularly important for people going thought college, as they develop during this important time. My only personal regret is I wish I made more time for clubs &amp; friends during this period, as I focused on my studies. If you are a current student, UMiami has so much socially to offer, so take advantage of resources. Please do not let this special time pass you by!\\n     All these years later, I still think of my experiences at UMiami. It was an excellent part of my life journey &amp; I was lucky to attend such a fine institution. I will always be a CANE at heart. If you are a student attending UMiami, appreciate and make the most of it. It is very special!",

            "description": "By far the best private university in the South Florida, some of the most amazing academic programs and certificate courses are available here in the heart of Miami. Being a Cane comes with a sense of pride and all students and alumni can agree on this for sure. By far the most beautiful campus I&apos;ve ever seen (maybe second to Pepperdine) but since I&apos;m born and raised in Miami I can say this is the place to be. Tuition is steep as are all private universities offering higher education. Graduate school is definitely a pretty penny but a degree from here is worth its weight in gold. Plenty of hospitals have affiliations with UM so it&apos;s not just any other school. Their law and medical  programs are amongst the most prestigious in the nation which earns them the top spot for higher learning in Miami.",

            "description": "Speaking specifically about my department... I would say that the academics were subpar and not worth the money that you pay for tuition. Two of my  professors were good researchers but poor teachers. NO engaging discussions. I wouldn&apos;t even call it a lectures. Not sure what my professors were doing but often times I sat in class wondering if the President of the University was aware of the low quality of education and teaching in my class. \\n\\nI would not recommend this university and it would be a poor choice for International students. It&apos;s outrageous how international students are not provided a lot support within the community. My department had difficulties understanding the procedures for I20 which ended up causing me a lot of grief.\\n\\n Don&apos;t expect a lot of support from the school if you are experiencing difficulties adjusting to the area. You&apos;re not going to get it. The school will take your money and then will have nothing to do with you once you&apos;ve paid your tuition. \\n\\nIn terms of the community: Unsafe. High car accident fatalities. When you drive along the US 1 to school,  you will see the many flowers/ or wreaths planted along the roadway in memory of people who have died in car accidents.  Expect to at least get into one car accident or two a year. I was in two car accidents. The first accident was on campus by a person texting and driving. \\n\\nExpect at least one murder in the area. And I say &apos;at least.&apos; An international student who lived in the apartments  very close to the university was robbed and stabbed to death in his home.  Miami is unsafe period. \\n\\nDo not trust their off-campus housing website. I had the unfortunate experience of renting from a landlord who posted a listing on the UM  website. This person ended up being a drug user and scam artist. Yes, I lost  some of my rental deposit when I had to move and after I found out she was a scammer and a thief. UM does not take any responsibility or filter  who or what posts housing listing on their website. So again, unsafe.\\n\\nIn terms of the community... If you are not bilingual or speak Spanish... Good luck. Moved to Miami and found it difficult to even go into stores. Sometimes store associates were not able to help me when I needed assistance because often times I was told in English that they didn&apos;t speak English. Same thing with uber. Many times had to take an Uber to school or out in the community and sometimes only got Spanish Speaking drivers. \\n\\nI will say  that the campus is beautiful but not worth the headache of attending the university. There are so many better universities that you can attend and it&apos;s not the University of Miami.",

It took hard work but it felt like family when being there. I received all support I needed with personal issues, academic questions/resources and education. The professors I had were for the most part amazing! I sometimes get the urge to go to campus and walk around because it takes me back to those days. I can truly say I had a wonderful experience at UM. I can understand why students like me move from other places to attain an education here. I moved to Miami from Los Angeles for my masters and can truly say it&apos;s opened many doors for me. Work hard, don&apos;t be afraid to ask for help and network! \\n\\nAlso, the school... it&apos;s very peaceful, green and just overall beautiful. It sometimes has a farmers market on Saturdays which is fun to go to when studying. There&apos;s also a farmers market on Tuesdays I believe? During the day with delicious goodies available. I am definitely still paying for attending this school (lol) but I&apos;m glad I chose this school as opposed to other schools in Florida. Go Canes!",

I owe this beautiful university so much and have avoided writing a review about it for seven years because, well, the pressure! \\n\\nBut alas, here are 10 simple reasons why I forever and always will bleed orange and green:\\n\\n1. We&apos;ll start with the basics and perhaps the most important - It&apos;s the sole reason I ever visited Miami in the first place, less alone decided to live here long after. \\n\\n2. With strong programs spanning diverse departments, I learned everything from why the sky is blue in meteorology courses to how to calculate energy burn in exercise physiology (did I mention my majors were Broadcast Journalism and Spanish?). \\n\\n3. Whether you like to scuba dive or anime, there&apos;s a club for you and more than one way you can get actively involved on campus. \\n\\n4. Studying is rarely fun but Richter Library makes it a little bit better and if it&apos;s too crowded there, there are plenty of other spots to hide out and buckle down when finals roll around. \\n\\n5. While the dining hall was never a highlight, the Rat, food court, weekly farmers market and occasional food trucks make sure you never go hungry. \\n\\n6. From the flying fish and alligators in the lake to the funky ducks, ibises and rare parrots flying around campus, it&apos;s nice to have some wildlife around you. \\n\\n7. The loop around campus makes a great running track and for some more exercise, the Wellness Center rocks, there&apos;s an outdoor pool for swimming (or tanning...) and a large intramural field for additional recreation.\\n\\n8. It&apos;s a private university (to the dismay of many) which means it&apos;s smaller but we still have sports teams that compete among much larger schools. \\n\\n9. Prez Shalala (sadly leaving soon) has a stellar reputation that brings in some world class guests ranging from President Clinton and Obama to the Dalai Lama and Anderson Cooper. She also used her expertise and brainpower to boost UM in the national college rankings. \\n\\n10. UM draws in a diverse student body which means I made so many friends from different cultures, backgrounds and perspectives. I am certain this would not have happened at every school I was looking to attend. \\n\\nTo say this list could be 100 points long would not be an overstatement. I could talk your ear off about my alma mater for hours. For now, I&apos;ll leave it here.",

            "description": "Our three daughters attend Carrollton and we are grateful beyond measure. Having 3 students there with 3 very different personalities, it is amazing to see how each one is cared for, inspired and motivated at all grade levels. To me, this relatively small community that gets to know each child is what sets Carrollton apart. We know that our girls will be known, heard and taken to new levels with the amazing faculty and resources available to them. In addition, the five goals of the Sacred Heart give the girls and teachers and administration a true direction on what they focus on in all aspects of their lives. This attention to significant spiritual, academic, philanthropic, friendship, and personal joirneys is carried out in everything they do and learn and helps guide the girls to successful and meaningful futures. We look forward to continue to see them grow in this unique and wonderful environment.",

            "description": "I thought long and hard about posting this review, and I&apos;ve waited a year to do so, but I really would have appreciated if I&apos;d known this before I made a decision that so deeply affected my child.\\n\\nThis is based solely on my family&apos;s personal experience.\\n\\n1.   SJKP offers curbside drop off and pick up.  If this is convenient for you, great.  If, however, you are like me and enjoy walking your child into his/her classroom and getting them settled before hugging and kissing them goodbye for the day, you will be discouraged from doing so.  Although I was told during my tour that &quot;parents are always welcome in the classroom,&quot; I was asked by the teacher to say my goodbyes outside the door and not come in (this was also later formalized in a memo from the director to all parents).  When you pick up and drop off your child this way (in a rush at the curb with a line of other parents waiting), you get no feedback from your child&apos;s teacher(s) about his or her day and no real opportunity to communicate your own questions, concerns or comments.  I felt alienated and found it very dismaying and distressing.  \\n\\n2. Nap time policy is that children do not have to sleep, but if they do not sleep, they are expected to rest quietly on their mats with no toys, books, or other distractions for approximately two hours (I don&apos;t know any adults that could do this with no phone, book, tv, etc, let alone a two-year-old).  My child is not a napper.  We struggled with this the whole time he was there.  If I didn&apos;t ask if he napped, no one told me.  They waited until it was so bad (he was yelling, kicking walls, and causing a major ruckus) to tell me on a Friday that he would not be welcome back for naptime starting Monday.  There is no alternative available to a non-napper.\\n\\n3.  During summer session, they rotated teachers every couple of weeks so leadership was very inconsistent for my child.  They were loose on the &quot;rules&quot; so when the school session started in August, we had to overcome two and a half months of letting certain things go, then backtrack to reestablish what would be expected of him.\\n\\n4. Because I was discouraged from entering the classroom, I had no idea who my child&apos;s classmates were, and I rarely had the chance to meet any other parents.  \\n\\n5. This school&apos;s philosophy is very centered on obedience.  When a child is &quot;disobedient,&quot; he/she is sent to the director&apos;s office.  My son told me once (and remember, this is a two year old!), that &quot;Mrs. [director&apos;s name] was very angry to me.&quot;  I found this attitude to be very unrealistic for such young children, and that it limited creativity and independence.  \\n\\nI removed my son from this facility after approximately four months.",

            "description": "This school was recommended by another good school so I figured it would be ok. I went for a walk through &amp; it appeared to be a nice looking school. I was told my daughter would be able to attend the school &amp; they had plenty of room. The next couple weeks following about two weeks to be exact I completed the application and tried for a couple days to get in contact with someone. Which I find very odd that I called this school, their main phone number and always went to voicemail. I&apos;ve never seen a school that doesn&apos;t answer their main phone literally throughout the whole day. I even emailed and still till this day no response. I finally got in contact with one woman and she gave me some excuse as to why the phones were never answered. I then told her i had filled out the application and was trying to give the enroll deposit. I was told the school was full.... weird that when I came just two weeks prior they said they had all the space available. Mind you I am a South American man of color &amp; of course my child is also of color. Now I kind of see why they weren&apos;t an abundance of &quot;minorities&quot; in their school. Really trying not to judge, especially a school that&apos;s so of &quot;God&quot;.",

These ladies quickly became second mamas &amp; grandmas to my girl! My daughter is always so happy to go to her teacher she would jump out of my arms. They always upload pictures and videos of her playing and have cameras where I can watch her. Overall such a wonderful experience and I&apos;m never worried about her while she is in their care. Unfortunately we are having to move away. My daughter was there for 10 months and I&apos;m so sad to be leaving! I don&apos;t think we will ever find a daycare as wonderful as tutor time!",

It&apos;s more than just a babysitter (which is what a lot of places tend to resort infant care to), they are so attentive and caring. My child lights up when she sees her teachers. \\n\\nFrom day one, all of the staff have helped me to feel great about leaving our little one there. The app that provides updates throughout the day is helpful. We can see that she&apos;s actually learning things. \\n\\nOverall great, safe, clean environment that I would highly recommend.\\n\\nUpdate: we now have two littles at Tutor Time and we love it twice as much. Both of little ones are doing great in their positive environment. \\n\\nThey have onsite extra curricular activities. We&apos;ve tried Play Ball (various sport activities) but will be trying dance this school year. The communication between the staff is top notch. I cannot say enough about how awesome Tutor Time is for my girls.",

            "description": "Realistically speaking as a former student this school has potential for great barbers and hairstylist BUT interesting enough there is favoritism some students are treated better than others and the school is totally unprofessional in certain key points and very professional in others. An example is if we are in a school for beauty and barbering I expect nothing more nothing less, the school seems to try to involve themselves in personal lives of students. Further more the teacher does have great intentions for the students and she is amazing BUT the favoritism still does exist. An example is if a barber or stylist brings a Cilent to preform a service they should be TAUGHT not given to a student that is almost done with school and already has the knowledge of the service the principal of the school is clearly a scam artist when given the opportunity and cannot seem to contain his emotions outside of the school which can lead to many dangerous things. Further more this school has been given a one star review due to the fact favoritism will always exist in this school. Favoritism will decrease the performance of the students morals and leadership, in the end leaders who bluntly show favoritism is a trait that they have no respect for the people they work with and or the students this will have a effect on everyone involved which is why I give it a 1 it&apos;s best to treat everyone equally regardless of past , race , sex , gender , love for other human , current life situation etc. if interested in more details on my experience at this school I recommend sitting and observing the class for the first two weeks and decide if these statements are factual",

The program is really good and kept the kid&apos;s brain fresh for the new school year. They give a presentation at the end of the week showing off their favorite creations and demonstrating how they work. The advanced campers shared the steps taken to create their masterpieces. Sometimes the robots didn&apos;t work and the campers handled the mishaps pretty well I think. The like that the campers were supportive of each other and didn&apos;t tease when it wouldn&apos;t work. At the end of the presentation they received a metal. I think the kid said if they were there for 5 weeks they would get a trophy. She got 3 metals. Coach K was a great leader and I felt confident leaving the 7 year old at the camp. I like the scanner sign in system. She will be returning next year for sure.",

I have two young children age 9 and 11 that attended Shiva Robotics for the first time, today. The young lady, Coach K, is absolutely amazing. She gave me a tour and showed me the awards that have been accomplished. They are very active and loves to build things. After their experience today, it is now hours later and they can&apos;t stop talking about the guest speaker and also how they learned to build a robot out of lego&apos;s and made it come to life. The guest speaker spoke about &quot;how to fix&quot; things and how they flew drones. They also allowed them play time.  They utilized tablets to teach them how to create the robots. They are so amazed and they now want to go back and learn more. Their interests are definitely sparked. Please visit this academy, it will change the whole outlook for your child regarding lego&apos;s and how to make them move. I give Shiva Robotics Academy 1million stars if I could. This is a wonderful place.",

A Child&apos;s Place has provided her a structured and safe learning environment where she is free to express her emotions. The staff has expectations of the parents which requires an adjustment period, but it is intended to provide the children consistency throughout their day. \\n\\nThis school promotes a pacifist culture rather than an aggressive one. The curriculum leverages a student&apos;s interest to cultivate their natural abilities. For example, students interested in art can spend more time doing art while students more interested in math can focus on math. This allows the children to define themselves. Conflict resolution is also built into the culture and no staff member ever raises their voice at the children. \\n\\nThe facilities do not have a commercial feel to them like most daycares. Operations are very transparent and not governed by corporate policy. COVID-19 created some hurdles but those were widespread. I can&apos;t imagine sending my child anywhere else.",

We are so happy with our decision to send her here!\\n\\nThe school environment is enriching, with a huge variety of learning and creative opportunities, and very true to the Montessori method. Our child has benefitted academically because she loves learning and loves going to school. All she wanted to do for her birthday was stay at school ALL day until they closed, and she once told me that Friday is her least favorite day because she doesn&apos;t have school the next day. We enjoy reviewing her weekly work log to get a glimpse at what she is currently working on and what her goals are, and the work she brings home is high quality.\\n\\nThe staff is supportive and accommodating. Any issue or concern we have had has been addressed and resolved quickly and to our satisfaction.  We enjoy the scheduled teacher conferences twice per school year, where we are able to discuss our child&apos;s progress and see her work. Outside of conferences, the teachers have made themselves available and accessible for any questions. During normal times, the school offered plenty of opportunity to volunteer in the classroom, and we have delighted in spending time helping -- I wish I could go to school here! \\n\\nIf you are looking for a unique, nurturing environment for your child, we strongly recommend A Child&apos;s Place Montessori.",

This school is amazing and the staff is the best in Jacksonville. If you are looking for authentic Montessori you cannot get better than this school. My kids have been out of the school for 2 years now and we have yet to find a school that compares to ACP. I have insanely high standards for my children&apos;s education because of the amazing foundation they received here. They truly work on whole child development including independence/ self care, social/emotional, physical/nutritional, and academic. The school has a very low turnover rate in teachers which is a hard thing to find nowadays in schools.",

After going to 2 other different AMI certified Montessori schools, I can attest that this place is the most legit Montessori school around. From a very young age at A Child&apos;s Place, my son learned to drink from a cup independently, use utensils, wash his hands, get dressed. He embraces exploration and loves the outdoors. The location we went to has a great outdoor area and is set in a home like setting. The staff are caring, patient, and very communicative. We wish A Child&apos;s Place existed in California!",

Being quiet is a rule of thumb for visitors to the library but is expected of the library&apos;s employees. \\n\\nUnfortunately this library isn&apos;t a good spot to study at though as there are two employees there who shamelessly flirt with each other just about every day. They laugh and bellow so loud that you can&apos;t focus on what you&apos;re doing even with earphones on. I&apos;m glad they like each other and they have some kind of thing going on. Everyone who spends more than 20 min in the library when they&apos;re both working at the front desk knows of them. The issue lies in the common courtesy they don&apos;t extend to those who need to use their facilities to study/get things done. \\n\\nIf it weren&apos;t for the constant chortling and loud laughter from the pair, this would be a great study space.",

I can say I applaud any true educator trying to enhance the lives of their students with knowledge. I won&apos;t get into politics, but until the reorganization is over I can&apos;t give a fair review. That being said, it&apos;s a bit crazy with the current re-org. Now for what you came for\\n\\nPROS:\\n*Medical, culinary, cosmetology, and police schooling mostly done on this campus\\n*Spacious campus\\n*Art Gallery is a neat place to visit. Nothing fancy, but art is view of expression I enjoy\\n*Kind Admin staff all over. Shout out to the Student Success Center and Library staff!!!\\n*Idk about teachers so let&apos;s not go there. \\n*Food at the cafeteria is delicious and cheap! Just the way I like it. With &quot;economical&quot; prices for healthy options as well. \\n*Friendly security team. Super helpful too.\\n*Water front lake. Nice touch and cool to look at. It needs some work done, but overall pretty cool to look at. \\n\\nCONS:\\n*Not a lot of campus school spirit. Idk who to credit that too.\\n*Lack of school unity. Each campus has its own personality...as it should, but doesn&apos;t seem like the brand of FSCJ is incorporated...hard to explain, but you&apos;ll get it if you visit all the campuses.\\n*parking...just weirdly designed \\n\\nOverall I give FSCJ a solid 4 out of 5 stars. I haven&apos;t heard too many complaints about the quality of school...it&apos;s a community college where a lot of UNF teachers teach as well. I&apos;ll let you speculate on that. \\n\\nThanks for reading and I&apos;ll catch you on another T2 Review! -Tj",

The focus of this campus is medical degrees, culinary arts, and cosmetology.\\n\\nThis campus is great because they offer very low priced dental cleaning. They even offer low priced hair salon and a fine-dining restaurant on campus. (Even the regular old cafeteria food here was superb!) This is a very important thing for us who are not blessed with health insurance, especially in these ridiculous economic times. The only draw back is that these services are only available for very limited hours (only on weekdays when most of us are working).\\n\\nI went here for the radiography program, and my teachers were excellent.

A general disinterest of the customer and  conversation between lounging &quot;artists&quot; make it a whacky ride of hair butchery as you ride a roller coaster of emotion ranging from fear to anger mixed somehow with laughter. There are some people who should limit their perceived talents to an assembly line. \\nAlthough, if you&apos;re an older lady with blueish-purpleish hair or you sport an American flag t-shirt with a massive bald eagle printed on it and the caption reads &quot;these colors don&apos;t run&quot; with mustard stains from last night&apos;s 50 scent corn dog extravaganza run to sonic, and you&apos;ve exclaimed to at least one foreigner within the last month, &quot;if you don&apos;t like it, you can git out!&quot; then your chariot awaits!",

I would never recommend this university for any international students because the opportunities available to international students are extremely limited most especially when they sense that you have a different accent. They are willing to take your money but not willing to help you with any jobs on campus. The professors are just ok. Not really anything I&apos;ve not seen before. In my opinion, don&apos;t come here as an international except they can guarantee you a stable G.A or campus job.",

Some of the degree electives were already gone before I started my first class.  Students  were stuck in classes they did not want to be in.  I was able to take one course from only one of the specialties I chose (I signed up for the education and the administration certificates).  The online courses and school server were plagued by server problems; 500 errors were common. I had to withdraw from the last classes I was enrolled in just a few weeks after starting the courses, due to these server problems.   The upper levels of school administrators and IT department acknowledge these  problems and still left me with no degree and no options to transfer credits to any other programs at the school.  All I received was a bill and a major waste of time.   The professors and department heads are great.  The people running the school could learn a few things from those working under them.",

The school lets &quot;boys be boys&quot; while still maintaining a rigorous and academically challenging approach for the more advanced classes, and there is a great sense of community here.\\n\\nThe jury is still out for me on the new &quot;21st century learning&quot; techniques.  It is good to see some innovation in education and I like that and the new scheduling.  I do think there needs to be a balance though with some more traditional education.  Chapel services weekly and the focus on service really help round out everything.  Costs have gone up significantly, so that lowers them a star, but the boys have really developed a sense of community, supportive classmates, and brotherhood that builds on diversity and strengths of each individual&apos;s talents.  That is such a positive that these boys will take with them for life.",

We took him out for about a year for COVID but other than that, he&apos;s been there the whole time and we LOVE it! Ms. Liz the director is so hardworking and dedicated to the kiddos, and much more hands-on than I&apos;ve heard of directors at other daycares. She is also super accessible and communicative. The teachers have all been great. The cost is extremely reasonable compared to other places and includes treats like music day, yoga (!), pizza day on Wednesdays, snacks, etc. I love that it feels like a small in-home daycare but has the resources of a larger chain daycare. The photos and videos through the brightwheel app make my day. They also make all kinds of holiday crafts with the kids to send home to us. I have my laminated mother&apos;s day handprint + photo hanging in my closet :) Also looking forward to someday taking advantage of the Parents&apos; Night Out babysitting they occasionally offer.\\n\\nWe made a great choice with SNT and I will be so sad when it&apos;s time for him to start kindergarten!",

The toddler room was up to age 3.  We began to realize that it became a revolving door of teachers, no consistency.  Our child is a fast learner and would often get bored and start to act out, especially after her favorite teacher left and the new director started.  The new director is a joke. We kept receiving calls to pick up our child, she&apos;s acting out, biting and that she&apos;s a danger to others.  This is behavior she doesn&apos;t do at home.  We were notified she was being kicked out, no notice.  They told us that they don&apos;t have the time or resources to work with her. Honestly, it&apos;s a blessing she&apos;s out of that school.  We feel our child was being singled out for being a smart toddler.",

            "description": "I worked at AchieveKids Palo Alto for four months in 2019; I previously worked as a Special Ed Sub Teacher for 25 years. AchieveKids has several big problems: one is what I call &quot;unwritten or unspoken rules&quot; that you&apos;ll eventually figure out in due time, but I&apos;ll save your nerves: many of the staff are a &quot;protected class&quot;, which means they can act unprofessional, disrespectful, and rude-- and the administrators will do NOTHING (sorry &apos;bout the caps, but that point is important!). \\n\\nI wish I had known before they hired me that some of my co-workers would disrespect me and treat me like shit and I was supposed to enable and/or ignore &apos;em. I&apos;m a white male, and two of my co-workers who had major chips on their shoulders-- i.e. loved to initiate power struggles on a daily basis-- where minority females. Some may call it reverse discrimination, but I call it a hostile workplace. I had zero interest in proving that I was better than anyone: I just wanted to work in a professional environment and feel like an equal part of the team. I really enjoyed getting to know the students. I didn&apos;t show up at work to be put &apos;one down&apos; by staff who had less education and less overall experience than me.\\n\\nThe other big problem: the kids are emotionally sensitive and set each other off constantly like fiery dominoes. I&apos;d say that 80% of time, staff are putting out those (metaphorical) fires: very little time to teach when most of the time it&apos;s a poor man&apos;s version of Behavioral Management 101. And most of the staff could benefit from an Emotional Intelligence/Empathic Awareness 500 hour course! Yes, many students and staff can be very nice and be fun to work with, but AK is an emotional warzone.\\n\\nLastly, I planned to quit AK after I witnessed a co-worker neglect her violent student-- and the principal came and took ME into his office for advocating for &quot;client&apos;s rights&quot;(!?!)-- but I was fired first. Wanting co-workers to treat you with respect and advocating for students rights will get you fired!? Yep. The admin staff and system needs a major over haul! Professional ethics are more important than favoritism and petty one-upmanship.\\n\\nDo not work here, unless you like to be hit by students and emotionally beat up by certain staff.",

She had months of work to make up during the summer and was struggling in class. We had tried multiple tutors from other places but done had made a difference. In fact, she was beginning to doubt her abilities due to the situation. \\n\\nSylvan Learning Center saved the day. Really. She went from a C- and hating math to a B- within a month, then to an A. She currently wavers between an A and A+!  We are so thankful and highly recommend this center. She will be taking summer courses and high school prep with them as well.",

Then I was able to get a program tailored for a High School student that can help with homework while mainly working on preparing for the SAT. The nice thing about Sylvan is it does not have just a short course for SAT prep, they can create to a longer term SAT preparation schedule.  The tutors are very helpful and the management runs the school well. And I will second the great system for tracking progress. They will also test students on both the SAT and ACT to see which one is best for them.",

The staff at the Mountain View location are so caring and amazing(please never leave!) , I never feel bad dropping off my kids there or worry if I&apos;m a few mins late.  My kids are thriving in Math and say they learn way more at Mathnasium than they do at their private school.  It&apos;s a personalised math teaching approach and your child will never move ahead until they master an area first.  In regular school math - teachers have to keep moving on to new material to cover the year&apos;s math curriculum so a struggling math student may never have a chance to close any gaps. I highly recommend Mathnasium!",

We started for my fifth grader as a way to skip ahead a year of math (which he did) because he already loved math, but now he is begging to keep going to Mathnasium (and even wants to increase his attendance to twice per week). My son works with Tim, who is great. The center has been wonderful with scheduling changes, tests and all the various things that come up having three kids. In fairness, we started with the Mountain View center because we were not totally happy with the Menlo Park Mathnasium which is closer to us. We found that the owner, staffing and tutors at Mountain View are truly great. My kids think they are going to Mathnasium to earn prizes because they are good at math and it is fun. And in the end, isn&apos;t fun what childhood (and I guess math) is about?",

My son started off the school year at above average and was falling behind towards the middle of the year in math. \\nMathnasium and the tutors have really done an amazing job at re-inspiring my son and making learning math pretty &quot;epic&quot; for my 9 year old!\\nP.S. there seems to be a good mix of kids that are already advanced wanting that &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; edge and kids that need extra coaching to gain skills and confidence.

We&apos;ve been enrolled for over one year, come religiously twice a week, and my kids still love coming here. The staff knows how to motivate kids and keep learning fun. When kids feel happy, passionate and energized about learning, it makes a big difference and Kobad and his team of talented tutors have cracked the code in doing this.\\n\\nI have 2 different types of learners, and Mathnasium knows how to cater to each child&apos;s individualized needs. I have one child who has always been super strong at math, understands concepts quickly and retains information well. Through the efforts of Mathnasium as well as our own support at home, this student is now in the accelerated math program at school. My other student is a little less diligent, often makes careless errors and is more of an average math student. However, he is now in the top math group too for his grade. \\n\\nKids may do their math homework here and the tutors will help them, but I don&apos;t usually have my kids do this unless they are feeling overwhelmed with the amount of schoolwork they have that day. Usually, I want to spend our time there learning Mathnasium&apos;s curriculum to make sure kids are getting incremental learning opportunities in addition to their school&apos;s content. While my kids go to an excellent school, I feel math in CA feels a little behind compared to other states (esp east coast states) and certainly behind that of many other countries. Mathnasium gives me peace of mind that my kids are being appropriately challenged. My parent philosophy on Math is that just like anything else, the more practice and exposure you have, the better you become. \\n\\nOverall, I am very happy esp because the kids never complain and are very happy to go twice a week. They have made friendships with the tutors and speak about their Mathnasium &quot;friends&quot; often at home. We highly recommend this center.",

            "description": "My kids started at The Wonder Years North Mountain View campus a couple of months ago and we have all had great experience with the school so far. \\n\\nFirst, the registration process is super organized and smooth. Ms. Lorena and Ms. Chenjin are very responsive and patient with all the questions I had at that time. And it turns out that they continue to be very warm, responsive, and helpful after our kids join the school. \\n\\nSecond, the teachers in the toddler program and the four years old program are consistently very nice, caring and professional. Before the Wonder Years, our kids attended another good preschool in our previous neighborhood. My older one was lucky to have nice and responsible teachers through her two years program to four years program in the previous school. However, it wasn&apos;t the case for my younger one since he started the two years program in that school. He cried almost everyday and didn&apos;t want to go to school for the two and half months when he was there. It reversed the potty training progress he had made and reduced his nap time. The situation dramatically changed after he started at The Wonder Years. Ms. Araceli and Ms. Krystal did an excellent job to help him settle in and adjust to the new environment. From day one, there have been very few potty accidents and he started napping a long time again. Every morning he&apos;s very happy that he will be going to school and sometimes he even asks to go to school on weekends. For my older one, she has a lot of friends in her previous school and could get emotional because of the transfer. Ms. Stacey and Ms. Angie from the four years program are very kind, caring and fun, which helped her a lot with the transition. My daughter likes the braid Ms. Stacey makes for her almost every day. She was very happy that Ms. Stacey read her favorite book in the class and commented on how funny the book was. She definitely has a great time in her class. \\n\\nThird, we appreciate that the communication among teachers, the administrative office, and us is very transparent and smooth. Our kids&apos; teachers chat with us about the daily status of the students. Whenever we have any questions or requests, Ms. Lorena and Ms. Chenjin always respond quickly with detailed answers and get our requests addressed.\\n\\nBesides all of the above, we also like the curriculum structure, various activities &amp; events, and the clean and organized classrooms in the school facility. In general, we would highly recommend the Wonder Years North Mountain View school.",

Before TWY, my kid had bad experience with another preschool, he does not want to go to school in the morning. In TWY, they love to go to school and excited to meet her friends and teachers.\\nThe kids and their families is the top priority to the wonder years. They tried everything to makes the kid happy and the parent 100% trust the preschool. \\nThe COVID-19 gives everyone a hard time, but I&apos;m glad my kids are with wonder years. They are very transparent to the families on everything, and did a great work to reopen the school safely and keep everyone healthy.",

They have a detailed curriculum for every day with associated activities and art projects. He especially enjoys the extra curricular teachers that come through, such as yoga and hula and Spanish teachers, experiences he otherwise wouldn&apos;t have had at another daycare. We are so happy with how well the Wonder Years has taken care of our son.",

            "description": "Our daughter went to the Wonder Years on Stierlin for 3 years, and always had a great time, both excited to go to school and happy when she left.  Only 5 days or less during those 3 years did she try to get out of going, which is about 1%. And I&apos;m pretty sure she just wanted to be lazy and stay home, not that she didn&apos;t like going :)\\n\\nMs Lorena and Chen Jin, who are  the Administrators, are very warm to both the kids and parents, and I mean 100% of the time, and I&apos;ve interacted with them hundreds of times.  The teachers are also very nice and caring, and build close relationships with the kids.  Our daughter would be going there again for her Pre-K year if we hadn&apos;t moved to a new school district where she happens to be able to attend school at no fee and close to where we live. \\n\\nThere&apos;s a lot of discussion in some comments about the school being strict but from speaking with many other parents of kids in her classes (we got to know many of them during Covid) I can honestly say neither I, my wife, or any of the other parents I know ever used the word &quot;strict&quot; to describe the Wonder Years.  I am kind of dumbfounded to see that word mentioned in the other reviews, as it was not our experience at all. \\n\\nI would also say the Wonder Years is well-run, organized and professional, but also warm, welcoming and thoughtful on a personal level.",

            "description": "I deliberated on if I should spend the time to comment and really if I can redirect just one family and save you time and money  - it is worth it. I removed two children from this preschool after one month. In print and online the school checks all the &quot;right&quot; boxes. What your child experiences daily is quite different IMO.  I really wanted to like The Wonder Years and after three weeks it was clear, the strict routine and insensitive staff was not the right fit for us.\\n\\nIn the Pre K class the morning expectation is that kids sit in silence and complete worksheets the moment they step into the classroom. I brought this up to the administration (Lorena and Chen) as being too regimented and strict for a 4 year old, their response was that the other option is to sit and read. So I persuaded my child to read one morning, it escalated into a conflict (in front of the class) with Ms. K over if reading is acceptable. I really don&apos;t know how a person in education could discourage reading. During the morning drop-off, I witnessed two teachers shaming children for being disobedient and yelling at other students to stop crying. This was unsettling.\\n\\nMy children gave me every indication they did not enjoy learning, playing or anything todo with The Wonder Years. I ignored my reservations at first but as a concerned parent I could not let it rest. I consulted other parents and child development specialists. The advice that stood out the most to me was that a child in preschool needs to feel emotionally safe and where parents feel a child&apos;s psychological, social and emotional needs are met. I had little confidence left in TWY and I disenrolled my kids immediately. Somewhere in the overrated enrichment classes, language classes, worksheets, copy good (a sticker awarded to my child 3x a week for sitting silently). The nurturing and respect for each child at The Wonder Years is lost along with embracing our kids as individuals.\\n\\nA few more points:\\n- A strict potty time is enforced, expect children to be lined up against the wall like cattle waiting for their turn and for every classmate to finish ahead of them. Accompanied with a lot of yelling to stand, sit and stop talking.\\n- When there is an outbreak and you get an exposure email midday in regards to foot mouth disease, lice, pink eye etc. don&apos;t expect to find out anything more like if this incident started in your child&apos;s classroom. The Wonder Years have their risk mitigation covered as a business.\\n- My observation during enrichment programs is that core teachers sit off to the side scrolling their phones and disinterested.\\n- The classroom lacked variety in activities and seemed to keep toys to a minimum IMO the class setup did not encourage exploration and imagination.\\n- The Mandarin enrichment class was excellent and the teacher connected well with the students, but we wanted to completely separate from TWY.\\n- My experience is pre pandemic and specific to the North Mountain View location on Stierlin. I cannot comment on what has changed since covid or other TWY locations.\\n- Parents were only allowed to tour one school (pre pandemic) and I toured South Mountain View on El Camino. I was told North and South are identical. This is not true. The South has a true gymnasium with equipment and the North location has a multipurpose recreation room that is mainly a classroom with foam mats along one side of the wall.\\n- It was the right decision for my children and family to return to a true play based preschool - where they have thrived, hopefully this post is helpful to you in your search.",

            "description": "Our daughter attended TWY for two years (toddler and 2s program) but we ultimately pulled her out of the 3s room.\\n\\nThere&apos;s a slightly long story that&apos;s not really worth going into here, but the basics are:\\n\\nPROS: I think the teachers are good. Ratios are legal, and in the toddlers and 2s room, I felt that the teachers had time to get to know the kids and keep communication open with parents. The hours are pretty work-friendly (although some policies are not). The best part, I think, is that the parents do get to know each other, and the kids hang out outside of school. I loved coming to Jackson park after school to chat with the other families! We made a lot of close friends (who we still keep in touch with!)\\n\\nCONS: We felt that the 3s classroom we were assigned was much more structured and regimented than one would expect of a &quot;play based&quot; preschool, and that our concerns weren&apos;t addressed. (E.g. children being harshly punished for laughing or talking out of turn.) Communication with teachers and especially the administrators was severely lacking. Their response to a couple of reasonable concerns (not being told that our child&apos;s teacher was changed, that the Chinese immersion program we thought we would be enrolled in wasn&apos;t available, that our child had reported a teacher grabbing her in a way that hurt her, etc.) resulted in a strong, very negative reaction that ultimately served as the impetus for us to leave the school. We simply no longer felt that we could trust the administration to look after our child after seeing them behave very vindictively toward our family.",

            "description": "Like one of the reviews mentioned, it is a very strict school. It has a lot of rules (e.g., bring lovey, diapers, kids talk to each other in the hallway, being punctual in the morning, naps, etc.) If your child is very independent and developmentally advanced, this might be a good school for you.  Their pre-K program (4-5 years old) is nice. But most parents probably do not know if your 2-year old is advanced or not. My daughter went to this school from 2 years old to 4 years old, complained about the school, begged me almost every day to pick her up early. I found her crying in the office a couple of times while the owner Helen and the site manager chatting to each other. Helen said my daughter is crying and throwing a tantrum because she does not talk to her. I said my daughter is apparently upset about something, and she is not very good at articulating her feelings yet. Helen said children at this age (4 years) should be able to negotiate with adults and since my daughter is not, she is throwing a tantrum. My daughter is very afraid of Helen.  \\n\\nI feel that they don&apos;t provide individualized education and care, but instead, they fit all children in the same box. We pulled our daughter out immediately and put her in a more loving and relaxing school. She does not complain about going to school any more.",

Her first response is, oh my gosh, you are going to ruin that teacher&apos;s career! Ok that is important. But to me as a parent, my child&apos;s mental/physical health is more important. She indicated that my child was lying and the teacher was innocent, without any investigation. Then she warned me that if this is reported to the State, my child will have to be interviewed by different people and it could cause even worse impact to my child.

And as an added bonus, they have a huge gymnasium type room. As a former preschool teacher, I cannot express enough what a smart idea rotating rooms is. The school also provides extra-curricular activities like Spanish, Chinese, Dance, and Music as a part of their tuition. Their everyday curriculm is a great mix of academics and play-based learning.\\n\\nMy daughter comes home happy, singing songs, reciting the activities she did that day, and I feel secure knowing she is in great care.\\n\\nKudos to the owners for their vision of creating a great early childhood center and gathering a great team of teachers and directors which in return, makes the kids happy.",

            "description": "We were relatively new parents when we started looking at preschools in the area for our son.  We really didn&apos;t know where to start and didn&apos;t have much time. We visited a few and talked to other parents to help us understand what was important to us.  Then we simply ranked them by overall fit, cost, and differentiation.  We concluded that for the schools in the area that fit our needs: i) there wasn&apos;t much difference in pricing, ii) there wasn&apos;t any strong differentiation between schools, and iii) most were pretty good overall.  We ended up choosing Wonder Years because they were closer to our home, and we felt that they had a slight advantage over most or all of the points of differentiation that were important to us.  \\nWe were immediately happy with our choice and after after more than 2 years, we are more than happy with our experience and the results.  Our 2-year-old daughter just started this year and we are having the same great experience with her.  \\n\\nIf I had to summarize our experience with Wonder Years in a single sentence it would be this:  They just seem to do everything well across the board that they are able to create a really great environment for child care and development.\\n\\nOtherwise, here is a summary of what we feel the pros and cons are:\\nPros:\\n1) The building is great!  It&apos;s relatively new and was built for its purpose.  We feel it&apos;s a safe building (e.g.: built to more recent safety and earthquake codes, newer materials, etc.), its layout makes it easy for the staff to safely manage the children, and entry is monitored/controlled. They even have toddler-sized flush toilets in the toddler bathroom.   \\n2) The facilities are clean, safe, and well maintained.  The classrooms are modern and well-equipped. I frequently see the teachers cleaning table tops and door knobs. Everything is organized and put away when not in use.\\n3) The teachers and staff are great!  They are experienced, passionate, engaged, are highly interactive with the children and parents, give great feedback to the parents, work with parents to help children work through issues, are very knowledgeable (and consistent) about child development, and clearly like children.  We get a strong sense of coherence and consistency from the teachers and staff; their teamwork really shows through.  We also observe that they are very alert for child safety.  \\n4) The curriculum is great!  They seem to be a mix of play and academic approaches.  But the curriculum covers academic, social, emotional, cognitive, physical, and mental development. They also encourage exploring, experimenting, and being creative.  The approach seems well rounded and well thought-out - both of which are important to us - and we are very pleased with the results.    \\n5) They offer optional enrichment programs to expose kids to languages, music, computers, and dancing.   \\n6) They aren&apos;t perfect and can make mistakes.  But we have observed that they acknowledge mistakes and work to fix them. \\n7) Full year with full or part time options - great for both parents working.   \\n8) The kids (and parents) are great! The kids are well behaved, diverse, are from all over the world, and my son has lots of friends at school. \\n9) Our kids love it!  \\n\\nCons (not much):\\n1)  Several shut downs during the year - a  week in the summer, two weeks at the end of the year.  Difficult when both parents are working.  Some other preschools have similar shut-downs, some don&apos;t. \\n2) Very long waiting list for new prospects - there seems to have been a mini-baby boom in Mountain View these last few years. I know several parents that are frustrated with the situation.  I&apos;ll add that there are several new preschools that have opened up in the area in response to the increase in demand.",

            "description": "After reading the other reviews, I decided I needed to share my experience with this preschool.  My son attended the Wonder Years Preschool on Stierlin for 3 months near the end of 2010 when he was almost 3 years old.  I really wanted this school to work.  I loved the location because it was so close to us, and the facility was brand new.  However, I soon came to realize, this was not the right school for my son.\\n\\nOne day, when I picked up my son, his class was in the bathroom getting their diapers changed.  (As mentioned in other reviews, they change diapers every 45 minutes even if a child doesn&apos;t need to be changed.  I&apos;m sure most of his diapers were dry which is extremely wasteful.)  From the hallway outside the bathroom, I heard my son start crying.   BOTH teachers kept saying, &quot;WHY are you crying?  There&apos;s NO crying.&quot;  \\n\\nAs I stood outside the bathroom door, listening to them say this over and over again while he&apos;s sobbing uncontrollably, my neck and face felt hotter and hotter.  I finally went in there, and they stopped suddenly when they saw me.  After I took him outside and he calmed down, he told me that they put on the wrong diaper. He wears Pampers, and they put on a Huggies.  Why they put another child&apos;s Huggies on him, when his cubby only contains Pampers, I will never know.  \\n\\nOne day after I had already given my 30 day notice, my son and I were hanging around outside the front of the school.  I noticed that a couple of kids were knocking on the glass door that leads from the side playground to the front entryway.  The teacher told them to stop knocking on the door.  Apparently, they kept doing it, and suddenly I see Courtney, the director, storm out of her office, throw open the door and yell (literally scream), &quot;STOP HITTING THE DOOR!  I DON&quot;T LIKE THAT!  DON&apos;T DO THAT!&quot;  She then slams the door closed, and walks back into her office.  I remember thinking to myself that everything comes from the top.  If this is the way the director &quot;communicates&quot; with the kids, what prevents the teachers from doing the same?\\n\\nI won&apos;t go into detail about how they did a bait and switch with teachers. Instead of getting the teacher with a couple of years experience that I was told he would get, he got a teacher that didn&apos;t have any teaching experience and was originally hired to be the dance instructor.  I won&apos;t go into detail about how the children spend way too much time standing in line when switching between rooms, about how the teachers never say &quot;hi&quot; and rarely smile, about how I was never told what activities my son did, how much he slept, or what he did outside.  Last, but not least, I won&apos;t go into detail about how the teachers posted on the bulletin board what they wanted for Christmas gifts.",

            "description": "I&apos;ve had my son and daughter in RSM Mountain View for two years.  They started in 5th and 7th grade. Their math skills and confidence have greatly improved and they are enjoying math more as well. The teachers are kind and the Principal is great- responsive and helpful. I feel lucky to have been referred to this program- which saved me from floundering around with various tutors. \\n\\nAlso, when the shutdown happened, RSM did not miss a beat- they were up and running with Zoom classes immediately.  The online homework and classroom portal is easy to use- much better than the patchwork of applications and systems used by the public school. I highly recommend!",

I called to understand what this is about, how exactly they teach and how is their methodology different from other schools. I emailed + called them at least 4-5 in total and even went through the effort of filling up an application form! I was motivated enough if I have spent at least an hour total or more to just get in touch!\\n2. Finally I got through a real person on the phone and he couldn&apos;t explain a thing and just kept saying let&apos;s schedule an &apos;evaluation&apos; for your child! I ask what the goal of this is? He says to determine the level of your child and whether to place in accelerated or advance class - apparently they are different! I said, i am not convinced I was to sign up for RSM sell me why? He had no response. I make another effort to say, please have someone else who can explain call me. His response, sorry they are all extremely busy!\\n3. Not just that, they have no idea who the teachers are going to be or what time the classes are going to be scheduled and yet they want a full commitment from our side and don&apos;t even offer a trial! \\n\\nGO TAKE YOUR ATTITUDE AND MAKE RUSSIA GREAT MAYBE?????",

Their math level is significantly increased, more advanced than their school level for sure. And RSM also provides opportunities for mathematics competitions. My daughter&apos;s&apos; teacher Ms. Tatyana is super nice and patient. She always engages the kids to solve problems in smart ways. The Director Ms. TuyetNhi responses my questions promptly and explains very carefully. Overall, I highly recommend RSM-Moutain View for kids to improve their math thinking!",

            "description": "Our two sons started with RSM Mountain View one year ago and their math skills have seen significant improvement. The principal, Ms. TuyetNhi did evaluation at the very beginning and her judgement of their strengths/weakness were right on the point. My younger son studied in Ms. TuyetNhi&apos;s grade-5 honor class last year and he was admitted into a well-known academic challenging private school for middle school this fall. Ms. TuyetNhi knows PAUSD and some private schools like Challenger math path from elementary to high school inside out. During Covid-19 time, she did multiple zoom meetings for parents to provide guidance on the planning for RSM MV students in different grades/levels. She knows RSM MV school students by name and when parents asked questions, many times she will reply by asking what&apos;s the child&apos;s name so she can give personalized suggestions. My older son started summer school late and she spent two and half hours in the weekend doing one-on-one session helping him catch up so he can be ready for the next class. I don&apos;t know how she can manage the whole school with such personalized attention but for sure she not only is an admirable math teacher but also holds high standards on business operation and acdemic excellency. The school office response is quick and the online homework system provides students challenging questions with the real-time finishing score. This is the school with a great leader and solid teaching mgmt system well worth you and your children&apos;s time and investment.",

He listed his top favorite activities as Kung Fu class, snacks, play time, and going to the park. OK, he also likes learning Chinese, but he likes eating and playing even more (well, boys...). \\n\\nAs for me, I feel that the best things about this school are:\\n\\n(1) All classes were conducted in Mandarin and all the kids actually speak Chinese in class and among themselves. I am extremely impressed at how they got that to work. In two other Chinese schools my kids have attended, kids always blurt out English even in class no matter how the teachers tried. It was a truly Chinese immersive experience here. They encourage the children to speak in class.\\n\\n(2) The kids are well behaved. This is really important to my son who has already encountered several rounds of fierce bullies in the past few years.\\n\\n(3) Master Wang (Principal and Kung Fu teacher) is cheerful, helpful, and sincere. He constantly provides feedback about how the kids are doing and he is responsive to our needs and requests. \\n\\n(4) Class size is small allowing a personal experience for the kids. Chinese teachers are warm and friendly. My daughter, who is usually inflexible even about minor schedule changes, felt comfortable and welcomed. \\n\\nI highly recommend this school to anyone with kids who would like to learn Chinese and/or Chinese culture. All 5 stars!",

They are truly dedicated to their students.  They have successfully built a very supportive learning environment.  \\n\\nThe academic program is great.  They take care in meeting their students needs, and challenging them to continually improve as students and human beings.  They offer a wide variety of elective programs.

Head of School has no formal training that we are aware of in educating teens with learning disabilities or mental health challenges. Head of School was the cruelest administrator and seems to pride himself on screaming at, swearing and humiliating the kids. This is what he did to my teen and when we questioned his tactics in screaming at our kid and dropping F bombs, his response was &quot;He knows what teens need&quot; . Actually what teens need is an emotionally safe space to learn and grow and this isn&apos;t it. His wife is Dean of Students and her role seems to be to play the &quot;good guy&quot; and gain the confidence of the kids. We were not told accurately the  backgrounds/makeup of teens at this school; kids from recovery programs, wilderness camps and many depressed and suicidal kids. Several of the teachers did not have bachelor&apos;s degrees or teaching credentials. This is a private school owned by the Head of School and his wife, there is no Board or accountability.

Today he is accepted to one of the top universities, he is a soccer player, he speaks a new language. He is a happy, positive individual with a bright future. We could not have achieved this without the support of PAP and the wonderful teachers who have been a teacher, a mentor and a friend. \\n\\nI am grateful to PAP.",

            "description": "My daughter started at Palo Alto Prep in 8th grade.  She had just come home from after being at wilderness for 3 months followed by 9 months at a residential program.  I was lucky that they accepted 8th graders and after the school year had already started.  She continued to have challenges at home and school for some time and it was really rough.  Despite this, the school supported her to become a better person.  She is doing great in school, contributes as a member of ASB and is considered a leader by students and teachers alike.  The teachers are really good and she loves the small class size where interactive discussions can happen.  And, they don&apos;t give tons of homework, so she&apos;s not freaking out with hours of work every night.  It&apos;s about the learning, not the workload at Palo Alto Prep.  She has her sites on college and will be ready because she knows how to ask questions, learn and think, not just plow through masses of homework assignments like in many public schools around here.  I dread to think what the situation would be today if Palo Alto Prep hadn&apos;t stood by her side and helped her when she needed it most.  I&apos;m a very grateful.  It has truly been a turn around story.",

It&apos;s all been so good.\\nWhen my son interviewed with Palo Alto Prep at the end of 9th grade, he was one glowering, angry, shut down kid.  At Palo Alto Prep not only did the teasing and bullying stop, but the students were incredibly nice to each other.  My son was accepted for who he was. In time, he was able to get over the anger and show his giving and compassionate side.  Now, his nickname is Teddy Bear even by people who meet him and have nothing to do with  Palo Alto Prep.  He spontaneously gave roses to all the girls and staff on a school trip. He&apos;s helped with tutoring.  He&apos;s supportive, funny, and confident.  You can only be that confident, compassionate and giving if you have good self worth.  My son has found self worth at Palo Alto Prep because it&apos;s been a loving and accountable community.  It&apos;s been a super experience.   \\n\\nMary, mom of graduating senior, 2012",

During a meeting held at my request, the Director stated that he was a black belt and then threatned to knock all of my son&apos;s teeth down his throat .  The decision was then made to remove my son from the school - PA Prep refused to refund any of the unused tuition.  This was terrible place to send my son, and a terrible waste of money.  PA stood to gain - now that had more room to enroll the next student.  Beware.",

HIs grades have improved simply by being given options in addition to  strait core academics. At Palo Alto Prep students are offered great skill building classes like Rock Climbing, Scuba and Aeronautics.  They are taken on trips to the great outdoors - hiking in the mountains and kayaking on the water.  They have dances and other social events.  They are given opportunities to be of service to others.  As an upper classman my son has been able to work as a Teacher&apos;s Assistant in classes he&apos;s enjoyed but has &quot;aged out of&quot;. At PAP they see each student as an individual and work with them to reach their true potential.  The teachers, administration, students and parent community are all lively and engaged.  I would encourage you to go on a tour or shadow this school.  Your child will know immediately if this is the place for them.  Good luck!",

I was told the staff established positive relationships with all students and the student body was like a family.  In reality, this is not the case.  Instead, a high percentage of the students have behavior problems, drug issues and have been in the juvenile justice system and this is the only school the parents can find that will take them.  Other students are placed in Palo Alto Prep by the public school system because of various issues.   The school administration is more interested in maximizing tuition than in creating a safe and nurturing school environment.   The school is not a safe place in my opinion.",

The daughters are super cute, but despite the accolades that Stanford claims for Joel Stein, his pictures of his most beloved subject are only subpar. After a whole hour of going through his drive, the class shared their own respective pictures and there was nothing - NOTHING - educational about his feedback. He was almost scared of displeasing the students. Understandable. But educate your students in some other way! Joel himself is a nice guy, but I don&apos;t want to pay people so much just because they are nice folks.\\n\\nUnfortunately I did not think to research these offerings by Stanford Extension on Yelp before signing up. And to this day I seethe and remain sorry for losing a couple hundred quid for one of the most boring, uneventful, useless class of my life. If you want to figure out the arcane functionality of your fancy DSLR, look elsewhere. Have signed up the hubby for a weekend seminar at the Aperture Academy and have high hopes from the reviews.",

Then they changed it to a digital online class because of COVID19. Then they wouldn&apos;t offer a refund even though the course was no longer in the original promised format AND didn&apos;t function properly, AND even though I asked for a refund well within the request date (that wasn&apos;t acknowledged or respected). I was looking forward to spending thousands of dollars on courses with this program when live enrollment opened again. Now I don&apos;t trust these stingy scam artists with my money. Even worse that they were so inflexible during a pandemic when unemployment is sweeping the country. GROSS.  Furthermore, every single online course from Udemy to LinkedIn offers self paced video recordings, group resources, and downloadable digital materials. Stanford&apos;s digital system is a clunky mess that makes no use of the online resources other learning resources offer online. The courses are outrageously priced and low quality compared to the thousands of others available online. Shame on you, Stanford. Shame on you.",

Requires heavy participation. Great leadership class for women.\\n\\nWSP 75: Effective Non-verbal Communication\\n- Rating: 4 STARS\\n- Taught by Jeff Cabili\\n- Helped me identify areas for improvement.

It just took a long time to start learning core photo topics (aperture, shutter speed, composition). Too much time I think was spent on background/history. Heavily lecture.

Stone never really delved into anything very deeply and didn&apos;t deliver any incisive intelligent anything. The drop date was three days after the class started and one day after the teacher posted the first assignment. How on earth can anyone figure out in less than 24 hours if a class is going to work out? The coup de grace was when one of the students critiqued my work in the most snarky, attacking way. I think she was secretly angry with me because I wasn&apos;t participating full on -- a fact i discussed with the teacher early on due to time constraints. Instead of defending me or calling out this behavior in the interest of keeping the forum safe and supportive for all the students, she noted that it was good for me to get a negative reading.

The courses, teachers and staff, are world-class in every measure. In fact, you will, in many cases, find yourself being taught by the very best professors that Stanford has to offer. \\n\\nSeveral of my thirteen course teachers were Stanford faculty that had been awarded Excellence in Teaching awards from their various departments or in a few instances, University-wide awards. You just can&apos;t get any better instruction anywhere and although the prices per unit have risen dramatically, they are still well-worth it for the intellectual and spiritual value you will derive from them. After all, an education is the greatest gift that you can give someone or give yourself and also something that can never, ever be taken away. The C.S. staff is also amazing, from the top on down, everybody is friendly and efficient. If you have questions, they answer them right away. A+ for everyone.\\n\\nSome of the courses I completed were; Music Appreciation, Leadership, Hemingway &amp; Fitzgerald, The Jazz Pianists, Archaeology &amp; the Bible, Gothic Cathedrals, Beginning Spanish, The Jazz Singers, Financial Planning 1 &amp; 2, Financing the High-Tech Startup, Jazz &amp; the Concert Hall and the Invention of American Movies. Taking the Startup Course helped to get my angel-invested company, &quot;Compareitall.com financed so I got the most out of that one until the whole internet bubble crashed, then took us all down. And my Spanish course got IGETC&apos;d by West Valley so I avoided taking 2 years of Spanish at Berkeley along with all of the C.S courses that I took before applying to CAL transferred in, so I saved a boatload of money there too. Yea for Stanford and for me too.\\n\\nPersonally, I love Stanford, all of it with a total love. I love the libraries, the parks, the museums, the churches, the stadiums, the bookstores, the golf course, the cafeterias, the pools and on and on. Often times when the weather is warm, I just drive up from San Jose, park my car and walk around with my business number forwarded to my cell so I can do two things at one time. The campus is gorgeous, with all of the oak trees, walking paths and sandstone buildings to feast your senses upon. The smells, the feeling of peace, the happy tourists and students going back and forth on bikes or with cameras just add to the bubbling inner excitement that you get when you enter Stanford&apos;s space. In my opinion, Stanford is the finest university in the world and if I had my choice to go to any school, I would choose it over any other.",

They were excellent, super well organized, incredibly useful with the result of making me want to go there should I ever be in dire medical straits. In fact all their medical classes have been excellent, including their mini-med series, and especially anatomy led by a hand surgeon - super awesome.\\n\\nTheir jazz program is amazing, and some of their random offerings, on baseball for instance, were great. Business classes are mixed, depending on the instructor. Actually a lot depends on the instructors. I&apos;ve had non-Stanford professors that were enthusiastic and eager to impart knowledge, Stanford professors that are just as amazing and wise as you&apos;d hope, and once and a while a Stanford professor that so seems to hate teaching that you&apos;re just like, whaaa??? But that&apos;s rare.\\n\\nI took a few writing classes here and for the price wasn&apos;t impressed. The instructors were variably uninterested or unavailable. The student demographic seems markedly different between the online and in person classes. The online classes populations were from all over the world. This meant there were a lot of timezone differences that made for some pretty disjointed classes. The disjointedness was complicated by some students who were needy, or who would complain about the slightest reading load, and many/most who never read others&apos; work. I haven&apos;t yet taken a writing class that hasn&apos;t been populated by people yearning to write their life story, regardless of what the class is supposed to be about. But although I personally might look elsewhere, there seem to be some people that really get a lot out of it - so don&apos;t let me dissuade you.\\n\\nThe organization itself is super responsive. The staff are efficient and nice. Their online registration is easy and excellent. You can drop classes if you do it really quickly and that&apos;s an option if they turn out to be not for you. (They also cancel classes if there&apos;s not enough interest.) Some of the online forum software they use is clunky but other software tools are fine. The campus is of course beautiful if you take classes on campus.",

I took my son to the Tutoring Center to see if it may help after researching online and visiting other tutoring firms.  The Tutoring Center&apos;s director had him completed a diagnostic assessment to determine his proficiency level in different areas.  We decided to go with Tutoring Center because my son needed more personal attention and help, not just worksheets to be graded. They provided him with a writing prompt and grammar practice at his level during each session.  The director and her team of tutors are patient and kids get grab bag to be rewarded for completion of tasks to stay motivated.  Gradually we have seen my son making improvements in his ELA and he started feeling more confident in reading and writing.  They provide regular updates on his sessions and an annual formal assessment.  I recommend the Tutoring Center to other parents.",

The site director is very willing to work with families on a case by case situation.  The center has many different time slots to help meet everyone&apos;s busy schedules, including Saturday sessions.  My son always comes out of his sessions happy, feeling proud and accomplished.  We have had the opportunity to work with many different tutors at the center.  I am happy to say that while my son does have a couple of favorites, he always reports that &quot;they all are good&quot;.  The center also provides you with mini updates and tests to check progress. While the center has their own materials, they are happy to review any specific concerns with concepts at school/homework.  There is an incentive program, which all kids love! The students are able to redeem their earnings for many different prizes.  Overall our experience has been wonderful at this center.  I am very thankful to all the tutors and director for the help they have given my son in catching up with his academics.",

He started with the Tutoring Center at the start of his second semester and in just a few months, his grades went up. He was understanding subject matter much faster, was able to complete all his homework in time. He also learned how to manage his time during tests and therefore, finished 9th grade with an excellent grade in math... and (more importantly) a renewed confidence in his abilities. We can attribute most of that improvement to the coaching he received at the Tutoring Center. \\n\\nIt&apos;s a new year now, and we are on to a new subject. Prema and the staff are great - very accommodating and helpful. I highly recommend this place!",

I truly found the material to be very challenging, but both my tutors, Subi and Evo, were very helpful and gave me practically one-on-one attention. They made sure that I learned my basics solidly so that I could ask higher level questions when I came in for my hour tutoring session. They were very flexible and open to rescheduling, and always found a way to fit me in for extra sessions if I had a big test coming up. Even though I would sometimes get frustrated with the sheer amount of math and physics the course material required, they would always break it down for me into more manageable parts so I wouldn&apos;t get overwhelmed. All the employees were very kind and helpful, and I never felt like I was being patronized when I was receiving help. I would definitely recommend getting tutored here!",

            "description": "Overall we had a very good experience with the center. I enrolled my 7th grade twins last January. Both performed well in 6th grade but come 7th grade, they definitely took a turn both in attitude and motivation. It didn&apos;t help that they had a teacher who was new to teaching and another teacher who was retiring and completely threw in the towel half way through the school year. Their grades suffered greatly: some D&apos;s and an F.  It&apos;s now October and one son has straight As and the other has 5 As and 1 B. The center is very good about tailoring a plan to meet your child&apos;s needs and will keep you updated with emails that summarize their strengths and weaknesses as they progress. They are also very flexible with their scheduling. We had numerous sports related activities that meant changing their schedules, sometimes weekly. The director, Subi, is very patient and accommodating and quick to respond if there&apos;s any  questions or concerns. I have to hand it to the tutors as well, my twins are hormonal and many days not much fun to be around. They didn&apos;t want to go to tutoring on top of a full day at school and they&apos;d walk in with attitude. Subi found the right tutor/student match for them to keep them in check. There are a couple tutors the boys worked with who had heavy accents that made it challenging for them to understand. I talked with Subi about it and he arranged for them to work with someone else, which we were grateful for. They thoroughly enjoyed their goody bags-students are rewarded well for completing assignments and the boys always were excited to come home with candy, small gift cards etc. Do make sure you read the handbook they give you at orientation. I slipped up and when the kids were in track, they only went 1x a week and were earning make up credits for missed sessions. Come summer we realized this and were going 3x a week to take advantage of the make up sessions. Also when you are done with tutoring, make sure you know the rules for giving them notice. We are continuing a month longer than I had planned b/c I wasn&apos;t on top of the rules. Good luck, I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll see positive results!",

I liked that there is no homework - lots of other places seemed to have worksheets or nightly assignments.  If asked, the instructors will align their lesson with what is being covered (currently or upcoming) in the classroom at school.  The one hour lesson is split into 3 distinct sections, each with a different subject and tutor.  This design seems to work well for my child who doesn&apos;t always have the longest attention span.  The make-up policy is clear and flexible - they even offer a LOA over the summer to allow for travel.  Progress is measured and reported back to parents with weekly mini reports (emailed) and an annual assessment (in-person).  My child is very motivated by the &quot;prize-based&quot; incentive program.  Finally, the location is very convenient.  I am often able to go to the gym or grocery store while my child is at the tutoring center.  I would definitely recommend this place.",

Subi, is extremely helpful and patient with our ever changing schedule.  \\nTTC&apos;s approach to learning is fun and effective. My son (5yrs old) started this program with a limited base knowledge of letters and numbers.  In just a few short months, attending only two days a week, he became more confident and was reading site words and more.  He now loves to read anything he sees in the world around him. It&apos;s not just his reading that has improved, his writing and math skills as well. He actually likes to spell words as he is using them. This is a well balanced program.  \\nBecca is amazing! She is always quick with ideas to make learning fun and exciting in our normal everyday activities.  The entire staff is very informative about all of my son&apos;s progress from day to day. When my son loses focus during class, they use positive reinforcement to help him get back on track. They do not scold, nor put him down. I appreciate this tremendously. Learning should be a positive experience. My son get&apos;s that from being in this environment.  Thank you Melissa and Becky!!! \\n\\nI strongly recommend stopping by this location to check it out for yourself.  The facility is bright, clean, and welcoming. Plus, they offer a FREE assessment test for your child!!  Yes, FREE!  Why not discover your own child&apos;s strengths and allow he/she the opportunity to grow in a healthy learning environment? \\n\\nI am glad we found The Tutoring Center on Grant Road!!  THANK YOU TTC!!!",

            "description": "The Tutoring Center is an excellent tutoring place for enrichment! Our son who was diagnosed with a learning disability has been attending the center for the past two years. He has made more progress at the tutoring center then any of our other efforts.  The Tutoring Center on Grant Road in Mountain View is a warm and friendly place with a commitment to the families they partner with.  We have recommended the Center to all of our friends and as a result at least three new families are using their services.  Since we started our son has improved a full grade level.  They have definitely given our son a boost in his academics that he needed and now is showing great progress.  We like their services so much we have decided to enroll our second son.  We highly recommended their services!",

This is strictly for The administrative department and enrollment department specifically Kimberly Kunde and Julie Vo. \\n\\nI was so excited to be part of this program to have a better life for my daughter and myself as a single mother I completed the academic side of the program and when it was time to do the Externship program I was hit with medical setbacks which I have doctors notes for but unfortunately I was told that six months after I completed my academic portion of my schooling I can no longer be part of the program. I wouldn&apos;t be able to finish my externship meaning I wouldn&apos;t be able to get a job as medical Assistant after I begged and pleaded to just give me one more month to complete two more weeks of Externship due to medical issues. This place is uncaring and a money grab. They crushed my dreams because I had a medical issue. Funny this is the career we all joined the medical field to take care of people who are having medical issues. These people are not nice and uncaring.",

            "description": "I understand that this school provides a valuable service to those seeking further education, this review is less about the school&apos;s programs as a whole and more about how absolutely poorly the Pearson testing center is run here.\\n\\nI was scheduled for a certification exam on a Thursday night, one of their only two exam nights per week. I showed up well over an hour before my exam was scheduled and began studying a little bit more. I noticed that there was literally only one person in the front for the better part of the hour I was waiting. It wasn&apos;t until about 20 minutes before testing - 5 minutes before the people taking the exam where supposed to check in - that the rest of the test administration staff started rolling in. \\n\\nThis is a bit of a red flag, as MOST places I have been to try to get there well before check in to make sure the computers we&apos;re testing on are working properly, and if there was an issue they would have time to try and fix it.\\n\\nThis is not at all what happened. \\n\\nThe exam I scheduled myself for was supposed to start at 6:00 pm. I wasn&apos;t told what was going on, aside from &quot;Technical difficulties&quot; until around 6:40 pm at which point the staff mentioned that their wifi in the room was down, and had been for a while and no one had done anything about it. Very shortly after this, the entire facility lost wifi, and the servers were not on site - a poor design choice in terms of a &quot;quality&quot; testing center\\n\\nI was assured by the staff that the director of the facility would &quot;look into this first thing in the morning on Friday.&quot; Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and most of Monday came and went, and nothing from the testing center, or from Pearson VUE. \\n\\nSo I showed up today 12/16/2019 to ask what the status was, and was givin a piece of paper with a phone number and case number to call. Only, they gave me the phone number THEY should use to call as it pertained ONLY to the testing center.  \\n\\nMy issue with this site is the gross negligence and incompetence of the testing staff in this unfortunate situation for myself and the other people who where essentially hosed on Thursday night, assured something would be done, and then, shockingly (HEAVY SARCASM) nothing happened.\\n\\nAs of now I am out $400 for this exam, and am expected to handle this myself after their extreme lack of foresight and laziness in this situation.\\n\\nI will not be taking another exam here, nor would I suggest any one else do the same. The extra drive will be worth the avoidance of the headache caused by this site.",

NOPE, when I looked up reviews on Yelp, Google, and Yahoo ALL TERRIBLE... Even read the &quot;Filtered ones&quot; Only reason they don&apos;t show because some have profanity, mostly all directed to Tim. I don&apos;t blame other peoples frustrations. I completely understand why now!\\n\\nTim is rude! Simple as that. \\nHe claims to want to help you, and ya at times he will coach you correctly and give tips, but he&apos;s treats you stupid and likes looking down on students. As if New Riders were not nervous enough on a bike, Tim just made me feel stressed out more anxious riding. With his smart remarks and his constant  yelling! \\nHe doesn&apos;t have patience and would rather kick you out the class. I experienced this, even when asking questions about riding. I&apos;m not the only one! These reviews speak for themselves. Many riders did not even return, near half failed. I guess in his mind it&apos;s because they are not capable drivers. But I&apos;m guessing it&apos;s him not being a suited instuctor! Because talking to other people who have taken classes elsewhere, and reading other reviews, they seemed to enjoy it and actually stayed the 3 days to learn and became proficient riders!\\n\\nKeep going on just how bad this was? Well I came here because they had open seats registering on the CA site. So I Paid online. Then got a call a couple days later that class was canceled because not enough people registered. Umm hello? That&apos;s a testimony to how bad this place is! Anyone looking to sign up knows how fast theses classes fill up, especially in the summer! Well stupid me for not taking my refund. I waited that extra week and finally did my courses.\\n\\nOh He Failed That&apos;s Why He&apos;s Leaving A Poor Review, Right? WRONG!!! I PASSED ON MY FIRST TRY. I don&apos;t want any funny business or them messing with my waiver, so I waited to get it in the mail before writing this review. \\n\\nBOTTOM LINE IS STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE LIKE A PLAGUE.",

I was thrilled to learn MVLA offered a course which fit them. The subject material came very easy to me. It was partially due to the teaching staff and partially due to the fact I have played a crucial role in assisting with the care of loved ones in my life. Clinicals in the lab were shown to us EXACTLY how we needed to do them during our state boards. Literally, exactly. When it was time to take the boards, I felt confident. Apparently much too confident, as I failed and had to reschedule..at no fault of the instructors.. 2nd time around, I passed. YAY! \\nBecause of complications at one of the facilities, we worked in two nursing homes for our clinicals. This taught me one thing...I did NOT want to work in a nursing home. It was advised to me to participate in the Acute care class directly following the NA course. I was unable to enroll due to a conflicting work schedule. I applied to hospitals without the Acute care course under my belt. I waited a month to hear back, but am proud to say I am an employee of Lucile Packard Children&apos;s Hospital Stanford. I can&apos;t wait to further my education. Thanks to MVLA and their wonderful staff, I have the proper groundwork to do so.",

            "description": "The lecture portion of my class was taught by Tim Arnold. He seemed like a fairly nice guy. One of those &quot;funny&quot; guys that makes jokes through 80% of the lecture. He did have a lot of useful information and was very good at the verbal instruction portion of the class. \\n\\nFor the two riding sessions I had Brian. I did not enjoy Brian&apos;s instruction. Here are a few of the reasons why:\\n\\n#1 After a new exercise Brian said to me, more than once, &quot;did you even understand this? Because you didn&apos;t do it right at all&quot; and that was the entire extent of his feedback. Not, lean to the left or look left or keep your eyes up just &quot;you didn&apos;t do it right at all&quot;. \\n\\n#2 During the exam I asked him for clarification on a turn that we were going to be tested on and he said &quot;this is the turn that we did all day&quot; me &quot;we did a series of turning exercises today, which one is this&quot; Brian &quot;the one you did all day long&quot; me &quot;again we did a variety of turning exercises today could you please tell me the name of the exercise&quot; him &quot;just follow someone else&quot; and he stomped off. \\n\\n#3 I and half the class failed the riding exam. \\n\\nI sent Tim Arnold a follow-up email right away asking him to review my riding assessment. Since he had been such a nice guy in the class I expected him to see that there were only six people in the class (half the normal class size) and see that HALF of those failed and ask Brian what happened. I don&apos;t know about anyone else but if I were given half the customers that my position was expected to be able to handle and HALF of them still failed I would not be patted on the back as an exemplary tester, but instead my instructional skills would be questioned. \\n\\nInstead Tim Arnold (who is the manager as well) refused to even review my riding exam with Brian and told me I could take the class again. I then tried to schedule a second class and it took me no less than 10 emails and THREE weeks to get him to schedule me into a class, during a time that I specifically asked NOT to be enrolled in. Six of my emails he didn&apos;t even respond to. \\n\\nThe next riding lesson was again with Brian. Brian was 80% less douchebag-y that day and actually provided helpful feedback instead of &quot;you didn&apos;t do it right at all&quot;.\\n\\nThe two assistant rider coaches from both sessions were great; Linda and Doug both provided great feedback in a detailed manner and remained upbeat. \\n\\nI spent two weeks riding my motorcycle around town with my learners permit before my next riding lesson and subsequently passed. If you have never driven a manual car or a motorcycle before I would say you have a 99.9% chance of failing. So if you book with these folks be aware that it will likely take you two weekends. \\n\\nThis is not a system where they work more with the people who need it, everyone gets the same amount of time and if you pass you pass, if you don&apos;t see you again for five hours in the sun on asphalt. I would recommend the course offered in the Mission College parking lot over this one. Everyone I know who has taken it mentioned how they worked with those that struggled to ensure they learned the material and passed. This was not the case with Tim Arnold&apos;s crew.",

            "description": "I took the MSF course here a couple of years ago. I don&apos;t remember which instructor I had, but I don&apos;t think it was the militant one that previous reviewers had mentioned.\\n\\nThe class is 3 days long- one evening of lecture and two saturdays of riding. I was in a class with only two other girls and then several guys- many of which already rode motorcycles. Apparently, you can get an insurance discount by completing the course, so many were in for that reason. Or had been riding with just a permit for a long time. \\n\\nThe classroom portion is pretty boring, but important to learn. It could probably be condensed into a shorter period of time, but whatever- it&apos;s only one evening.\\n\\nI was super nervous about the riding portion. I didn&apos;t even know how to drive a stick shift car at the time! But the instructors were awesome and patient. I was put on a small Kawasaki bike, which was really comfortable for me. One of the other gals was put on a scooter, rather than a motorcycle, since she only wanted to learn to ride a scooter!\\n\\nThe school will provide a helmet and gloves, but you are responsible for wearing boots that cover your ankles. I did not have any, so I went and bought some inexpensive rainboots and they did the trick. \\n\\nI took my particular session in November and and both weekend riding courses, it poured the entire time!\\n\\nSo, there were probably about a dozen people in the class, which means, a lot of waiting. You spend a lot of time waiting for your turn to do the instructed maneuver. It would have been nice to do more riding and less waiting!\\n\\nWhat was really impressive was how serious these instructors take everything. They will stop you after ever move you do and tell you what you did wrong or right. \\n\\nDuring the second half of the second riding day, it turns into the examination portion. It&apos;s amazing how serious and solemn this part of the class becomes! You&apos;re deducted points for each incorrect move. You&apos;ll have to do basic moves like a figure 8 (can&apos;t put your foot down), shift from 1st to 2nd gear and then stop and start, stop quickly, and much more. It wasn&apos;t easy, that&apos;s for sure. If you drop your bike, it&apos;s an automatic fail. One girl did drop her bike, she was ok, but immediately taken off the course. \\n\\nThankfully, I passed! It was quite interesting to see a handful of those guys that already knew how to ride not pass the course! \\n\\nI highly recommend taking this course if you are considering riding a motorcycle. It&apos;s proven that riders that complete this course are much safer riders! It&apos;s for your own good!",

Tim Arnold rubbed me the wrong way the first moment I met him.  Throughout the first class, it was obvious he hates his life, and anyone he comes into contact with.  Basically plays the Drill Srgt. role, and likes to have a lot of power over others.\\n\\nTim especially didn&apos;t like his students asking questions regarding the content, which I find absurd considering the fact the he is there to teach and we are there to learn.  I filled out an MSF survey after the class noting my dissatisfaction with Mr. Arnold in particular, yet never heard anything back.\\n\\nAs you can see, this class and Mr. Arnold&apos;s particularly negative, rude and militant behavior left enough of a lasting impression on me to write this review 5 years later.  Brian was a bit rude at times as well, but no where near T. Arnold.  \\n\\nI would not reccommend this class to anyone based on these reasons.",

Like many of you I was in search for an accredited CNA program that would help me develop my skill and career in the healthcare field, as I have had no prior medical experience prior to this class. Mrs. Catherine Rosillo and Mrs. Criselda have done a phenomenal job teaching us about what a CNA does and the necessary skills we need to have and learn as CNAs. The MVLA CNA program is also counted for college units at mission college. What I really like most about this school is the support they provide you and many resources if you would like to further your nursing career and continue your education. They also help you find jobs as soon as you graduate. Overall this program is great and I had the best instructors!

And they teach you in class that you shouldn&apos;t ride when angry! \\n\\nThat being said, if you&apos;re just starting on a motorcycle, you need to take this or another class like! \\n\\nI would recommend a different training class for a more supportive environment. I mean you are paying $250 for this...",

Majority of the teachers are mean and rude! the only one&apos;s that are awesome are Doug, Linda &amp; Josh. there&apos;s1 more but i 4got his name. But it&apos;s hard to get these instructors cuz they are different all the time which sucks cuz u want the same one that instruct you on the first day. Brian failed me cuz i missed 4 points. WTF! what a waste of my time, day and money!",

Most of the guys in my class already had bikes and had been riding extensively. Despite this, I passed the class with little difficulty, while half the other guys got kicked out before the final riding test. \\n\\nTim Arnold taught my class and yes, he was intimidating.  Some people, both on Yelp and in my class, were upset that he was so authoritative and assertive. Well, he&apos;s supposed to be! He&apos;s the instructor, not your friend. He&apos;s telling you what you need to hear in a way that will make you pay attention. It was kinda scary and overwhelming at the beginning of the day, but by the end it was fun. The class covered a lot, but the final riding test was very basic. If you can&apos;t do this stuff, how in the world could you ride safely on the street?  \\n\\nBased on some of these reviews, I get the impression that people thought they were buying a motorcycle license.  Not everyone is cut out for this. It&apos;s better to find that out in a parking lot than in traffic.",

            "description": "I just completed a Medical Assisting class offered through MVLA Adult Education.  Today I took the National Exam and passed along with every other classmate of mine.  This program moves quickly (~four months), is much more affordable than any other Medical Assisting program I&apos;m aware of and provides excellent preparation for the National exam, externship and working in the field.  I can&apos;t say enough about the teacher who teaches this class.  I credit her with the high pass rate of her students.  I would recommend this Medical Assisting program to anyone who&apos;s on a tight budget, willing to work hard to be prepared to pass the National exam.  You&apos;ll also have many lab hours to develop and practice the skills necessary for medical assistants including venipuncture, injections, vital signs, EKGs, blood/urine testing, to name a few.",

            "description": "I agree completely with everything Kim H. has written. The program does move quickly ~ four months for us compared to eight months with other programs. We received the same education as the longer programs offer. Plus, we were set up to take the certification test whereas other more costly programs do not offer that. The teacher is an absolute gem. She moves the class along quickly to cover everything but she makes sure that everyone understands each unit. She also makes herself available after class for any student needing extra help. This is a teacher who really cares for her students and wants to see success in all. The cost for this class is a fraction of the cost that other programs charge. I believe the next class will start sometime at the end of August. If you&apos;re interested in being a Medical Assistant, this is the class for you. (650) 940-1333",

My son would come home excited about the stuff he learned and tell me about how much fun he had pretty much every day.

We have had a lot of changes and it is very important to help integrate him into a new setting and not just drop him off to strangers. I was told I cannot observe and I cannot sit with him on his first day to get comfortable. The reason was given that they did not want strangers in the classroom scaring the other children. I tried to talk, but was Mrs. Berry would not let me speak or get a word in. She did not care that I wanted to be a nurturing mother and was more concerned with the privacy of her employees. She kept stating I was &quot;out to get her&quot; and &quot;working against her&quot; because I wanted to ensure my child would be comfortable and safe. I have toured many daycare facilities in this state and others and ALL others had open doors and were willing to let us spend a few hours with my son there BEFORE paid fees and obligation and were willing to let me do whatever I needed to in order to help my son feel comfortable. This Ms. Berry yelled at me, was unprofessional, extremely uneducated in child development (I can say that because I am actually educated in child development) and she is just rude. I was a NEW parent wanting nothing more than to ease my child into a new situation and she would not have it. Based on our conversation, she in not interested in the well being of  the children. Please feel free to contact me for details. But this is not a nurturing place you want to take your kids. Based on her reaction to me, she likely yells a lot at children and treats parents like dirt.",

You book a 2 hour window, and your group is assigned a table, properly social distanced. You choose your project(s) from small ornaments/ window decor to large platters and bowls (Two of our party made sun catchers, I made a spoon rest. ) You can look at a lot of design possibilities of completed projects, then learn how to use glass nippers. Your table has an assortment of various colors and shapes of glass, and you assemble your project with a dab of Elmer&apos;s glue. The works are then fired (slumped) in a kiln-- flat ones once, mine gets a second firing draped over the spoon rest mold to shape it. The finished artworks will be mailed to us in about 3 weeks. Serious fun! Prices vary by project",

The folks here do a great job of walking you through the process and then freeing you to create! We were able to pick up our creating 2 weeks later. Reservations and masks required. Highly recommend. Just a note: strange building and parking lot. Give yourself some time to locate it if it&apos;s your first time visiting.",

The basic gist for a walk in visit is you show up, look around at the examples of what others have done, hopefully get inspired, get a brief lesson in how to cut/break off small pieces of glass and away you go.  \\n\\nThe only real guidelines are that you have to pick a basic pattern/design like a large square which could be used as a bowl or a circle for a plate.  There are different sizes ranging mostly from 5 inches to 12 inches.  Pretty much it&apos;s only needing to pick a size and what colors of glass that are available which are the limiting factors.  After that you let your imagination take over.\\n\\nWhen you&apos;re done the pieces are eventually fired in a kiln and if you live in the area you can pick them up in a few days.  If not they&apos;ll ship anywhere and at least for us that took two weeks until we got our finished products.  The lovely wife and I abstained instead opting to let the children do pieces simply because while the process/experience is fun it can get costly in a hurry depending what size you pick plus the shipping.\\n\\nI included the before pictures and somewhere I have the after pictures but their website has a lot of finished product pictures which show you what is possible.\\n\\nSo if you go, ignore the fact that the studio is not the easiest to find in the building that they&apos;re in, everything can get costly depending on the piece you do/how many you&apos;re doing in your party and that parking can be a bit of a challenge because the experience is fun, the owners are both passionate about glass/make sure that you are having a good time and more than likely artsy or not, you&apos;ll enjoy the experience. \\n\\n(They&apos;re open Tuesday-Saturday 10-6 and Sunday from 10-5.)",

Their shows are amateurish, poorly run and poorly attended.  This is great because small audiences mean a better chance of my ideas being used!  Their &apos;you say it, we play it&quot; motto guarantees that I&apos;ll see at least 3 scenes about poronography in one 90 minutes show.\\n\\nNot that they need my help.  Their improv style is so poor that it isn&apos;t long before every show degrades into a barrage of poop and penis scenes in a desperate attempt to get laughs.  And if you think calling somebody &apos;gay&apos; is funny, then you are in for a treat.\\n\\nTo complete an evening of truly bad improvisation the members of the troupe act like they are God&apos;s gift to comedy!  Strutting around post show as if they are unaware of the humiliating performance they have just finished.  I tell you, this group has no sense of shame, no concept of quality and no idea what they are doing.\\n\\nIf you enjoy unclever, uninventive improv filled with inside jokes and performed by asshats, then The Bent Theater is for you!",

If you are passing through on a quick visit, go to the Central Parking garage near the UVA Bookstore.   You&apos;ll have covered parking and can pay through a mobile app by the hour and half-hour.  \\n\\nMy teenage son (16 yrs) and I stopped by for a campus tour in mid-June 2022.  You&apos;ll need to register in advance for the combination of a 30-minute information session, followed by a 60-minute campus tour led by a current UVA student guide.  In my opinion, the highlights are probably seeing the inside of some campus buildings and learning more about student life from the guide&apos;s own experiences and perspective. \\n\\nBy the end of the tour, you&apos;ll have a thumbnail sense of the physical space on campus.  It was interesting to learn that first-year students are prohibited from having cars. This could be a plus for some students to encourage more walking and face-to-face interactions.  On the other hand, it may be a minus for other students who value having a car to go off-campus.",

Kennedy.  UVA, ranked 4th nationally for public universities, is Virginia&apos;s flagship state university.  It has around a 24% acceptance rate and highly competitive SAT scores, excellent high school grades, top writing skills, and a rigorous course of study are necessary for admission.  \\n     The campus is gorgeous and is referred to my students and faculty as &quot;the grounds&quot;.  First year students are not allowed to bring vehicles and all students must live on ground for the first two years.  Options include traditional dormitories and residential colleges (think Harry Potter houses) which range from sustainable living focused to international student living.  \\n     30% of students participate in Greek life but there are plenty of clubs and activities without joining a fraternity or sorority.  Clubs range from Wednesday Waffles to Aerial Silks along with the more traditional club/intramural sports and religious clubs.  Sports are huge for the Cavaliers including Division 1 Baseball, Basketball, Swimming, Golf, Lacrosse, and Football.  \\n     Rumor has it Dr. Seuss (Theodor Geisel) was denied admission here and moved to a mountain here and wrote a story about it.  Geisel ended up attending Dartmouth, so I&apos;m guessing he wasn&apos;t too heartbroken.  The Cavalier&apos;s nickname &quot;Wahoos&quot; does sound like something from one of his famous children&apos;s books.  Go &apos;Hoos!",

Make this room a stop on your trip through C&apos;ville if your a fan of all things spooky, or stop by if you&apos;re touring the University.

            "description": "Now that my prerequisites are done, it&apos;s just fitting to write a review of my experience at PVCC. \\n\\nBeing a stay at home mom was great and all, but I wanted to learn something new. I was lucky that I lived close to PVCC and started taking some classes. I didn&apos;t really have anything in mind, not even a clear goal, I just missed learning.\\n\\nFirst step you have to go through: ADMISSIONS. Be very careful who you talk to here. The advisors have a different take on which classes you can take or not. Advice seems to change from person to person. They are there to sell and make money from the classes they offer. I got credit for most of my courses from my previous degree in a science-related field, but one advisor wanted me to take the math placement test and repeat college algebra. One and a half years later, another advisor, said I didn&apos;t have to take a math placement test and repeat college algebra since my general, organic and biochemistry subjects were credited at the college. I would have wasted time and money on a class I didn&apos;t really have to attend. Thank goodness that sensible advisor was there that day and she signed me up on Statistics I (I got A, btw). In addition, it&apos;s better to talk to Advising in person. Emails won&apos;t get you anywhere.\\n\\nPROFESSORS: I am totally impressed. I took Anatomy and Physiology I and II here, and my professor was an MD. The Statistics I class professor has a doctorate from UVA. The Lifespan Development (PSY230) professor has very good credentials, but I DO NOT recommend HIM. Do NOT taken this professor&apos;s online class (last name starts with R). That psych class was the only B I got. I hate recommending looking up these profs at ratemyprofessor.com, but i totally recommend it now.\\n\\nFACILITY: Cadaver Lab. Great for students who are serious about studying Anatomy. Not all CCs have this kind of lab, so students here are extremely lucky.\\n\\nTESTING CENTER: Smells like the pits. I am very sensitive to smells and I couldn&apos;t concentrate from the moldy smell from the carpet.\\n\\nPROGRAMS: It is a Community College, so only A.D.s are offered. Despite that, the programs are very competitive. During my time here, I&apos;ve seen students compete like it&apos;s the Hunger Games (especially ADN hopefuls) because they only have a few seats in this program. It was what I initially wanted to apply to, and it made me sick to my stomach that I would have to do Battle Royale for this.\\n\\nHAPPY ENDING: As I have mentioned, I thought I was going to apply for an associate degree so I could eventually go back in the workforce after my stint as a sahm, but I got accepted to a 16 month Accelerated BSN program some place else. \\n\\nAVOID: I see a lot of MLM recruiting posted on bulletin boards and weekly job posting emails. It&apos;s even plastered in most cars parked on campus.\\n\\nOverall, it&apos;s a good CC, also affordable. I definitely recommend, especially, for adult learners.",

But now, I am very disturbed and disappointed in the behavior of Erika Jordan, the director of the daycare #269 in Maumelle. On August 5, 2021, Erika Jordan decided to call the police on a parent who&apos;s child attended the daycare since 2016. Instead of Ms Jordan taking accountability for her mistake of reassuring a parent their child was NOT on the waiting list and DID have a spot for the upcoming school year starting on Monday, August 9th, she proceeded to CALL 911. She also specifically gave a stereotypical description and used the word &quot;hostile&quot; with the 911 operator, prompting the police to show up. If this is how this daycare reconciles mistakes with parents who would want to send your children here? And this is just the short version. There are so many more details to discuss!",

So if you want random people walking into your child&apos;s daycare at anytime, this is the place to go. There is also hardly ever anyone at the front desk. Secondly, their &quot;food program&quot; is a joke. Supposedly they get it approved every single week and serve a balanced, nutritional meal, but unless you consider chocolate cereal with marshmallows, cake, cookies, poptarts, rice krispie treats, etc. &quot;nutritional&quot; don&apos;t go here. This is not a snapshot of their food. They serve these items every week. I have never seen a fruit served unless it is juice (which is empty calories). Also, my kids have come home FILTHY every single day. They are dirty with food all over them. I&apos;ve had several outfits ruined because they didn&apos;t clean up my child. The assistant director is really nice, but the actual director is very sullen and rude if you ever question something that she is or is not doing. All in all, there are better places out there that will take wonderful care of your child.",

            "description": "Independent scrapbook stores are few and far between.  None in my hometown, so when visiting Salem over spring break I made a point to stop into this wonderful scrapbook store.\\n\\nWhat&apos;s so wonderful about this place?  I think the first thing that comes to mind is the owner, Christy Wood who introduced herself to me and my children when we entered the store, shook my hand.  Gave us an overview of the store, pointing here and there at various things that were worth pointing out.  In addition to Christy, another very helpful young lady was working that day and pointed me in the direction of several items that were on my list.  So, great staff at Runaway.\\n\\nI was on a quest for paper.  Great selection of paper in racks, plus in bins in the back of the store.  The majority of the paper is a $1 a sheet.  That&apos;s easy enough to keep track of.  Endless embellishment options.   Plus lots of other scrapbooking &quot;necessities&quot;.\\n\\nThere is also this great selection of journals, or what they refer to as altered books.  I&apos;m not going to be able to describe them in order to do them justice, but good news is that they offer a class that show you how to make them.  Plus, lots of other classes are offered.\\n\\nThey&apos;ve been in business for over three years and I think that speaks pretty highly of them given the decline of independent scrapbook stores.  \\n\\nNice store, well organized, lots and lots to look at.  A great find and will definitely be back next time we are passing through.",

The shop is laid out so well, has such a good vibe and products I haven&apos;t seen in other mixed media shops.  I so wish I had a shop like this in my own area.  I had an eye injury the previous day and Christy even called and got me an appointment with her eye doctor so I could get it taken care of. This is a homey shop like you&apos;d find back in the day where the people are REAL and GENUINE and that is sooooo hard to fine.  If you have an arty bone in your body YOU MUST VISIT THIS SHOP.  It is a real gem.  Thanks so much Christy to you and your staff for all your hospitality!  :)",

I knew my daughter had an amazing educational experience when she came home and began to elaborate on her learning.  Kiely is an incredible teacher who has a true passion of early childhood education and the experience of nature and the learning that can come from it.",

I don&apos;t say this lightly - we have five children who have attended schools all over the country and in India and Abu Dhabi. I think what Abiqua gets right is the balance between a rigorous academic program and a holistic approach to understanding and nurturing the whole child. Whether your child is on the gifted end of the spectrum, somewhere in the middle, or needing additional support - the teachers have proven time and again they will &quot;meet your child where he or she is at.&quot; It&apos;s not just lip service - we have lived this.\\n\\nWe have considered moving out of the Salem area several times and two factors keep us here, one of which is the extraordinary education our children are receiving at Abiqua. I wish every single school in Salem provided the same experience - all children deserve this kind of education.",

I&apos;ve often seen the principal wandering around,  speaking to staff and students alike-always pleasant (and surprisingly stylish, if I might add) to talk to.  Really seems like she engages with the kiddos and the parents are constantly talking about great she is.  I have had some experiences in my own business with many of the students and the staff and everyone is just so pleasant.  Abiqua feels more like a NY private school :) Thank you for providing such excellent service to our local youth,  Abiqua.  You are so very appreciated!",

Although last year they combined some classes and it seemed to lower the level of teaching.\\n\\nI feel that their middle school is weak for the following reasons.  1) Very few kids 2) No teacher (computer program) for algebra and geometry.  Bullying problem which the the Principal refuses to admit or address.  I would not recommend it.\\n\\nUltimately my 7 and 10 year olds were happy there this past two years.  We opted to withdraw my middle schooler mid-year. The school was not challenging enough for him. In such a small middle school it was hard to avoid the bully.  Ultimately he was really unhappy so we had to pull him out. \\n\\nLastly, Abiqua is expensive.  The rates rise every year.  They are building a new high school which everyone will have to subsidize.  Plus the Principal recently told me that she felt that I was not supportive enough of the schools donation fund. \\n\\nI am not planning to send any kids there next year.",

I don&apos;t write bad reviews lightly.  \\nAfter learning about the confirmed child abuse that occurred here in 2019, I did some serious questioning before deciding to submit an application for my son.  The new principal, Rukina Contractor, assured me of her risk management tactics and her quality measures to ensure all children are treated appropriately.  So, I applied on 01/26/2021.  Since then, Ms. Contractor has given me the run around about my son&apos;s acceptance.  Despite repeated phone calls and emails, I still don&apos;t know whether or not my son is accepted here (today&apos;s date is 4/16/2021).  Every time I call she acts so surprised to hear from me and assures me she&apos;ll follow up, but never does.  Repeated and ongoing promises to get back to me, followed by silence.    \\nI&apos;ve concluded that they are in the process of denying my son but don&apos;t know how to legally do so.  It is either medical or religious discrimination, no other possibility at this point.  That said, the fact that she is incapable of having a mature, adult conversation with me about why my son is denied is concerning.  If she can&apos;t have that conversation with me (a parent she barely knows), can we trust she is able to do so with her employees when they aren&apos;t meeting expectations or standards?\\nTheir Assistant Principal, Carly, has been CC&apos;d on all communications as well, and has been silent.  She has not once intervened or stepped up to resolve the communication gap.    \\nI had to speak to an Admissions Coordinator, just to have my concerns emailed to the Regional Director in hopes of possibly hearing back from that person.  It is next to impossible to escalate an issue or concern in this organization, which is also concerning.  Parents have no ability to directly communicate with superiors above the local school level.    \\nWhile you may have a positive experience with this facility because your child is an &apos;easy&apos; case , etc. please consider what the above information could mean for you and your family should something important come up during your child&apos;s time here.  \\nIn summary, when things are easy everything is roses and sunshine.  When things are difficult you can&apos;t reach anyone, talk to anyone, or escalate an issue.  For a facility that has a confirmed history of child abuse (google it through ABC news), this is a major turn off for me and my family.  \\nThanks for reading, and I hope this helps some families out there!",

The Principle, Rukina, was not honest with us regarding my son&apos;s application for the summer camp.  First she told us she has many spots.  Then she said that she is waiting for approval of my son&apos;s IEP.  Then after three to four weeks, past our original planned date of attendance, she said there are no spots because other kids are extending their stay.  Never before did she mention that our spot is pending other kids&apos; choice to extend.  I would say she is very sneaky and not trust worthy.  I&apos;d advise her to be honest and professional.",

But when I see Villa girls in Philly, they often exclaim in gushing tones, &quot;Wasn&apos;t it the BEST time of your LIFE!  Don&apos;t you MISS it?!&quot;\\n\\nAbso-fucking-lutely NOT.  I always said the best thing about Villa was Malvern Prep down the road.  Between the pressure to excel in academics, play sports, and cram 51,000 activities into your schedule, I hated my life from ages 14-18.  \\n\\nI&apos;m not some Columbine outcast either.  I made good grades, had a group of friends, did charity work and was in the school play, choir, and volunteered.  Villa Maria&apos;s school policies were to repress creativity, demand conformity, and always look picture-perfect in your pervert&apos;s dream Catholic school uniform. \\n\\nVilla takes the credit for the natural tendencies of  excessively parented, upperclass white girls; which is to achieve.  It has nothing to do with the school or their ridiculously quaint ideas about education.  \\n\\nDon&apos;t send your girls to Villa.  If they are smart, they will do well in any school. If they need help or are not inclined to Lockean &quot;tabula rasa&quot; classroom environments, they will wither and die under Villa&apos;s oppressive regime. \\n\\nUp with education, down with Villa.",

My daughter asked to go to Villa.  She participated in sports, orchestra and of course charitable activities.  She is now waiting to hear from a PhD program in England where she wants to continue her work with children with chronic illnesses and their siblings who are often the last to get help.  I was diagnosed with cancer when my daughter was in 10th grade.  My husband was diagnosed one month later.  He didn&apos;t survive.  The nuns were a blessing to our family.  They worked with my daughter so she could take me to my treatments every other Friday.  They adjusted her schedule, her homework assignments and provided love and hugs when she needed them most.  I couldn&apos;t be prouder of my daughter nor more thankful to those wonderful women for getting our family through that terrible time.  No public school in the country would have done that.",

I know it&apos;s a religious school, but they don&apos;t have to push religion down everyone&apos;s throats. This school gave me religious trauma. They constantly reminded me that &quot;being gay isn&apos;t a sin unless you act on it&quot;, yeah lol... so is being an ignorant schmuck. &quot;God loves everyone regardless of who you are inside&quot;, but the second I say I like the same sex I suddenly &quot;am not loved by God&quot; and &quot;am going to hell&quot;. I&apos;ve heard some staff talking about others at the school in a not very &quot;catholic friendly&quot; way. The good book says: [Judge not and you shall not be judged. Condemn not and you shall not be condemned. Forgive, and you shall be forgiven.&quot;\\n-Luke 6:37]\\nSome people there seriously need to learn about their own religion. Don&apos;t get me wrong, there are a few amazing and loving teachers there that deserve the world and teach from their hearts like Mrs.Sellers, Mrs.Clapp, Mrs.Svercek, Mr,Overshown, Mr,Estrada, and the lovely teachers that teach pre-k/kindergarten students. There are a lot of good teachers that don&apos;t talk about others and are kind like Mrs.Glomb as well, but what I didn&apos;t enjoy was the whole &quot;you can be gay but don&apos;t act on it&quot; thing. What on earth am I supposed to do? Marry the other gender and be unhappy with someone whom I don&apos;t love? Mrs.Kubacak as well. She&apos;s amazing. I love them. Enough about that; they need to hire more cleaning staff, and fix the school up. I see many leaks, cracking walls, and the floors are very dirty. All they need for cleaning is more staff and for the school to supply them with more cleaning products.",

My experience was really good in the Biomedical Technology Department. Mrs. Debbie is fantastic and she truly cares about each students success. I can say the same about the teachers in this department as well. The hands on is there, you just have to put your hands in there. No one will tell you to not do that. No one will claim to read your mind, so if hands on is what you strive for, the professors are all about it. If you learn from a book better, then learn from the book. It&apos;s not high school, there is no hand holding to get you to do something. You&apos;ll get more feedback and help from a professor here than you will at a university, I know from personal experience. Take the initiative and better yourself. \\n\\nI can literally say my degree from TSTC has put my in a field that I make more than I ever made with my bachelors degree. These degrees will put you in the position to grow professionally. I would highly recommend going this route.\\n\\nThe 4/5 stars is due to signing up for classes can be a pain in the registrars office.

If you&apos;re inexperienced in regards to IT, you&apos;re probably going to have a hard time. Once the pandemic hit, the lab closed(probably still closed to this day), and any chance of one on one hands on training from instructors went out the window. When I went to the college to look around and ask questions, the instructor told me &quot;if you can turn on a computer and use the internet. I&apos;ll teach you how to become a network admin&quot;, \\nsounds too good to be true right? Well, it was, got sold some wolf tickets. Out of all the instructors I had, only two actually cared about my education and earnestly wanted to help me understand the material. All the other instructors would say &quot; read a book watch a video, good luck&quot; essentially. What I&apos;m getting at is this, if you are an aspiring IT person, and have some experience in the field you&apos;re pursuing, you may do well. BUT if you are the latter, inexperienced and need hands on experience to learn, you will have a hard time. If IT is your goal, spend the money and find a legitimate university or option that can guarantee you something in the field whether it&apos;s jobs or certifications. If I could go back and do it over, I would not have uprooted my life and attended TSTC. Six thousand dollar mistake, oh well, I hope this helps someone out there.",

However my fiance lived in village oaks and some pretty shady stuff went on. They tried charging him for $200 in paint repairs even though they were on the Unit Condition Report. That is the same amount it costs for them to replace the door. After much arguing they finally gave him the money. \\nAlso he was only suppose to live in his apartment for one semester and then we would move to family housing. He comes to find out that they had put him on a full lease and of he was to break contract he would not be aloud to attend classes the next semester. \\nBoth my fiance and I were in computer feilds. High performance computing was not HPC so he was getting the wrong title for his degree, and we were 3 years behind //told to use by a perfessor \\\\\\\\\\nPreviously I had been in culinary arts at TSTC and nothing was organized and 1 teacher was teaching 5 classes because they were understaffed.\\nThe book store is very small. And there is no restaurants on campus except the school cafe which closes on the weekends, along with the book store and nurses office.\\nthe one thing I did enjoy was how clean they kept the classes. Also from what I understand the other programs are excellent at tstc. The school has potential to be great but right now it&apos;s just not.",

My math professor explained what we were doing, didn&apos;t show us examples he made us all get up and do it on the board, thanks I love looking dumb in front my peers. I have anxiety so I went to disability services and they weren&apos;t accommodating. Told me if it&apos;s required to get front of the class like that I would have to do it so needlessly to say I bawled multiples times. The school is ugly, awful landscaping.

This review will be based solely on the exterior or the campus. \\n\\nMany people associate Baylor University with their incredibly skilled athletics team, and more specifically; their breakout athlete Robert Griffin lll. Chartered in 1845, Baylor University is one of the first and oldest operating universities. It&apos;s campus spans over 1,000 acres in size and it is hailed as the largest Baptist University in the world! \\n\\nThe architectural structure of the campus is phenomenal! From the newly constructed McLane Stadium to the beautiful Baylor bridge that crosses over the Brazos River; you are sure to endure an eye full of beauty while walking along this campus! The University is set upon the Brazos River where you can enjoy the stunning waterfalls while relaxing on the amphitheater. While I was there, I witnessed a few people paddling their boats on the river and walking their dogs over the bridge. \\n\\nAcross the Baylor bridge, you will see the enchanting Law Center. There is a path that is rightfully named the &quot;Bear Walk&quot; where you will find the names of many graduates inscribed on placards in the concrete. But perhaps the most popular landmark here, aside from the enthralling McLane Stadium, is the memorial statue of Robert Griffin lll. \\n\\nThis stunning replica of Baylor&apos;s diamond jewel features a life sized statue of Robert in his all too familiar stance. It is accompanied by a glass wall that lists all of his athletic stats and achievements as well as a self portrait. I would encourage anyone to visit the campus, even if it&apos;s only to view the exterior. Get inspired, and experience the legend that is Baylor University!",

For it is an investment like anything else.  Oftentimes you imagine your child winning scholarships to the best schools in the nation....striving for quality...etc. and maybe you have in mind a school that you would love for them to attend..I guess that was me.  Because growing up with a college professor as a father it was driven into your makeup that education was important and quality education especially...\\n\\nKnowing that if you work hard enough at anything in life and have focus and discipline you can achieve your dreams!\\n\\nWhen my daughter was in her junior year in high school,  she had several schools on her list as many kids do as they start thinking about life after high school.  My daughter has always been a high achiever and I knew wherever she ended up it would be a good place.  Perhaps Rice University?  Bringing her there as a little girl I always envisioned her attending this outstanding school!  With the best and the brightest!  Often known as the &quot;Harvard of the South&quot; Rice itself has a beautiful campus with a long colorful history and tradition!  Maybe UT?  Where her cousins are going...it&apos;s always good to have family close by right?  Maybe Texas A &amp; M?  A great school and conservative...which I liked.\\n\\nSo when a friend whose son was attending Baylor encouraged us to go to a spring premiere in my daughter&apos;s junior year we tagged along not knowing what to expect.  It was a full day of experiencing Baylor for prospective students and an opportunity to see the campus and meet students and faculty members.  Being my first trip to Waco,  I was very impressed!  I was totally won over by the beauty of the campus and the positive feeling of the student volunteers and faculty members that I met.\\n\\nEncouraged by our friend to apply although the tuition was daunting but generally reasonable for a private university...she continued to tell us that generous scholarships were offered to exceptional students but to apply early before all the resources were exhausted.  We took her advice and sure enough my daughter got the best scholarship they offered...next to a full ride!  After doing the math my wife and I agreed that it was doable and left the ball in our daughter&apos;s court.\\n\\nI don&apos;t think she had to think too long and too hard and her decision was made.\\n\\nAfter experiencing 2 years of Baylor and Waco; as a parent,  I must say the school is everything you would expect a great university to be!  The facilities are amazing!  And the feeling you get when you walk around the campus is indescribable.  One of feeling your child is in a good place and getting connected in a christian environment that encourages excellence!\\n\\nDeciding on a school for your child can be stressful but I must say in this case it felt so right.  \\n\\nSo for those parents who have given Baylor a thought I would say visit the campus during one of the fall or spring premieres and meet the student volunteers and faculty members and ask questions.  Also soak in the beauty of the Baylor campus....especially the new stadium, science building, student life center and the amazing Armstrong Browning Library!  I guarantee you will walk away impressed!\\n\\nA great buy with great scholarships!",

The professors passionately care about the students and are dedicated to their success. Not only do they place extra effort in the classroom, many will get to know you outside the classroom. Whether inviting the class over to their home for brunch, going skiing on their boat, or just sitting down chatting about life over a beer... they are the most approachable and of the highest caliber of all the schools I&apos;ve attended. \\n\\nGet involved! Baylor has a strong Greek system along with a plethora of student organizations to become involved with. Whether you go to Baylor or somewhere else, get involved! The leaderships opportunities along with the opportunity to make new friends all makes for an incredibly positive college experience. And, of course, it&apos;s fun to be involved.\\n\\nThe friends you&apos;ll make will be with individuals of the highest caliber. Mom was right, who you hang around with has an influence on you will become. So Moms, rest assured, the students at Baylor University are the people you want your sons and daughters to be friends with. \\n\\nThe education I received at Baylor prepared me for real-world success. I&apos;ve been lucky to have had the chance to attend such a great university. Thank you, Baylor, for everything.",

My review and experiences are based on visiting the campus as a &quot;Bear-in-law&quot; with my wife, class of 2007. Baylor catches your eye as soon as it comes into view driving on I-35. The whole campus is composed of classic brick building with small steeples and towers protruding into the subdued skyline. I loved touring the campus with my wife and taking in the sights and sounds of a vibrant college campus. One thing that I feel makes the campus especially walkable and visually appealing is the prolific use of parking garages. Baylor utilizes attractive brick multi-level parking garages to offer ample parking while at the same time condensing the size of campus and thereby avoids the creation of asphalt wastelands.\\n\\nOur last trip was during Homecoming 2014 weekend. The whole campus was decorated with signs and murals for the occasion. We attended some of the weekend events, and especially enjoyed the Friday night which included a pep rally followed by fireworks and a massive bonfire.",

I made sure everything was in order so that it would be an easy transition upon arriving. Since I was placed on some waiting list for payments because of financial aid, I was stuck going to orientation the week before classes started and on move-in day. Up to the day before we went down to Waco, I was told that I had been assigned to a dorm room and that I didn&apos;t need to worry about tuition as my scholarships and financial aid would cover everything except my books and maybe the meal plan. \\n\\nI arrived for orientation and a man working at the registration check-in was rude to my mom and I. He said he wouldn&apos;t be helping me and called someone else over. I received my bag with a book assignment for the school year along with other information. I was asked what program I had been accepted\u200b into and was told where to go from there. I went to the assigned auditorium for the pre-health program and while the information was interesting, there were a few questions I wanted to ask but did not get to during the Q&amp;A session. We were told to line up and that we could ask one question each. I lined up and the woman answering our questions skipped over another student and me\u200b. Both of us are minorities and we were the only ones that were skipped and ignored. We were told by the woman that she was done and that we could ask our advisors. \\n\\nI went to advising and signed up for classes. The advisor was very lovely and when I told her what happened, she said she knows about that woman and her attitude towards people not like her.\\n\\nWe were going to lunch but someone recommended getting my student ID. I went and filled out a short form only to be told that I needed to get some paperwork from FA to prove that I could go ahead and get my ID picture taken. I went to FA and they wanted me to pay at least $3,000 then and there. I was not prepared for that. We were told to contact our bank and thankfully we had the money and paid it. Apparently, I was only going to be provided with most of the scholarships from FA if I did exceptionally well during my first semester and then it was all based on\u200b the rest of my time at Baylor. So if I kept my grades up and didn&apos;t mess up, my scholarships would kick in. Sherry or Sherryl was very rude and condescending\u200b towards me for not knowing this despite being in communication\u200b\u200b with FA the whole summer and never being told any of this. I have the e-mails to prove it. After all that trouble, we went to have my ID photo taken but decided to go get our lunch instead since the line for the ID was longer than before. \\n\\nWe went to lunch and they were done. No lunch for us despite having the lunch ticket. We were hungry and not happy with how everything was turning out.\\n\\nI went to go see \u200bthe dorm room and guess what? There was a mishap at the housing office and they did not have a room assignment for me. I was there and someone else had been assigned that room. I was given a  list of hotels I could stay at and possible housing around campus. I showed them the letter and e-mails where I had been assigned a dorm room. After a stressful amount of waiting while someone found out what happened, they found me a dorm. However\u200b the roommate wasn&apos;t too happy because she was supposedly paying for a single dorm room. She didn&apos;t let me in and immediately went to complain about the situation. My family told me not to leave my\u200b belongings in the dorm because she might do something to them. \\n\\nWe went to the bookstore and bought Baylor trinkets before heading over to get my ID photo and missed the information sessions in the afternoon because we were still trying to get everything situated. Something was going on with my information and I was sent back to the FA office where I was told that we needed to call back the bank. At this point, \u200bwe have just about had it and an argument started between my mom and the FA people. Apparently, \u200bthey don&apos;t accept money from our bank so they needed something from them and being the weekend that was not possible. It didn&apos;t make sense to us and they did not do a good job of explaining or showing us any of this in writing. My dad wasn&apos;t willing to use his credit card and found it strange that they couldn&apos;t accept our money when they were more than willing to accept it before.\\n\\nI returned my stuff to the bookstore and took off after the roommate called to threaten me. Baylor&apos;s response was for me to stay at a hotel or look for an apartment. It&apos;s unacceptable\u200b. Halfway back home, I received several calls and messages asking about me not being at orientation. They didn&apos;t sign me in and didn&apos;t believe I was there or what had happened. I have\u200b the bag and book. Almost a week later, I got somewhat of an apology. The bookstore staff and advisors were more understanding and showed more concern.\\n\\nI transferred\u200b and graduated from SMU instead. More scholarships and honesty.",

I am so proud of him as he has worked hard to get to where he is at. I would have hated for him to start his career off wrong with a backing from Baylor who does not stand by what they are suppose to stand for. He is a smart kid &amp; saw right through the politics at Baylor. Now that the football player (Zamora) beating the dog video has surfaced &amp; Baylor is still allowing him to play for their team, I am even happier my son went in a different direction. I would not recommend this university to any1, if anything I would try to talk them out of attending Baylor because they are without morals or ethics!!!",

They gave me some run around about  a licensing agreement and said they couldn&apos;t do it, and bring it in and for more money they would look at it.\\n\\nThey are very unhelpful, never call back when they say they will, and have no problem selling utter crap to people that don&apos;t know any better. these people are snakes that hide under the guise of cheaper tech options and environmental responsibility for 260 dollars you can  get a computer that will survive the warranty period then go to shit right after it expires. where you can then get a run around and anytime you try to get some one on the phone and pay more money so they can fix the garbage they swindled you into to begin with. \\n\\navoid them like the plague these are terrible used car sales men who sell nothing but lemons",

            "description": "I have been doing business at NextStep for nearly 20 years.  I own a Computer Consulting business and most of my clients are elderly.  Many are wanting to upgrade their very old computers with a faster more updated version.  Next Step has been the perfect resource.  I have helped parents purchase computers for their younger students, helped clients purchase printers, laptops and desktops, all at a fair and affordable price.  I have even purchased equipment for my own grandchildren and husband.   It is not necessary to spend all your money on a brand new computer (or piece of equipment)  when this amazing resource is available in our community.  It hasn&apos;t always been the fanciest place to do business, but their current location on Garfield is as nice as any retail store I&apos;ve been in.  Good job guys!  I continue to refer people to you, and for computer repair and maintenance, you also rock!",

The Yelp listing gives the address for the donation end; the retail end is a few blocks away at 980 McKinley St. More info is at http://nextsteprecycling.org/locations-html\\n\\nMy dad&apos;s old Mac died, and he needed a replacement more affordable than the $1,200+ quoted at The Mac Store. Next Step&apos;s retail store set him up with a 2006 iMac on OS 10.7.5. The base price was $299.99, but, any time you make a donation at the donation end of Next Step, you get a 20% off coupon for the retail store, so we made a donation in advance of our purchase and got the computer for $239.99 with the coupon. Had my dad been willing to switch to a PC, he could have got something even cheaper -- and Next Step&apos;s PCs are all on Windows 7. Next Step also referred us to Techmedic in the Big Y Shopping Center for transfer of data from the old Mac to the new-to-him one, and that cost only $80, less than the $99 quoted at The Mac Store. \\n\\nAs for the donation end: If you have privacy concerns about donating old computers, techs at the donation center will remove the hard drives for you if you ask. For most computers this is a simple process, but I once brought in an old Mac laptop on a Saturday afternoon and was told to bring it back on a weekday so a more experienced tech could extract the hard drive -- I did so, and then I didn&apos;t have it sitting in my attic any longer.",

They have a decent selection but things are very disorganized. Items not marked are sold at arbitrary prices. Prices marked will pull a silent WTF out of your mouth as you jaw drops. \\n\\nNeed a set of decrepit 25+ year old blown stereo speakers? Rush down and pick up a set for $100!\\n\\nIt&apos;s a great place to buy common used obsolete electronics for almost new prices while you get looked at by the staff like you are a nuisance.\\nGreat idea, bad implementation.\\n\\nEdit: \\nJoseph Z -  I&apos;m not jaded. I&apos;ve been going to the NS store for several years and have found several parts I needed. I have an opinion that is based on realities there in the store consistently reenforced by the state of conditions there in the store.  75% of the time what I am looking for is not priced and the staff have a very unwelcoming attitude. Arbitrary pricing; it is when one visit it&apos;s $20 and the next it&apos;s $15 and then $20 again. Speaker example; on shelf for over 6 months with foam totally shot. It&apos;s not fiction. When at their old location; every time I went there someone was at the counter with an issue the cashier could not satisfactorily resolve. \\n\\nSorry you don&apos;t agree, but again the review is based on direct experience and not wishful thinking or attitude. From reading your review you do not sound like an independent reviewer.\\n\\nThis review is in regards to the STOREs, not the entire operation. K thx.",

All the techs are very knowledgeable, they go out of their way to make sure if you donate something there there is no private data left on there when the computer is resold. They get an enough donations to have Macs and PCs in stock, The prices may be slightly higher than eBay but you have the service and 90 day warranty of a local shop and you know you&apos;re helping the community in the process, Plus you don&apos;t have to pay for shipping and you can see what you&apos;re getting, vs. not knowing what you&apos;re getting when you buy a used computer on eBay. I have bought more than one computer there and I will definitely in the future I highly recommend this place if you can&apos;t afford a new computer.",

I can assure you this is not the profit gobbling junk yard as was the perspective of the jaded reviewer below. DarkM is Not nextStep&apos;s accountant. You can be sure the money you spend at this store will all be used to support a worthy cause. NextStep does Awesome and important work for our community and since the mandatory recycling law of 2007 their recycling revenues actually declined $200,000 a year. They have saved over 10,000,000 (yes million!) pounds of eWaste from entering our landfills and ultimately from polluting our soil and streams. They have supplied over 20 schools, domestically and internationally, with computers (for free). They teach classes for free and do job skill training for a very diverse group of people in need. Store employees are very helpful, non-judgemental and possess a wealth of knowledge. They are an important and valuable resource for customers. All items are tested and sold in working condition unless clearly labeled otherwise. Prices are competitive and based on how much a similar item in comparable condition sells for in the marketplace. If you need an inexpensive remote control or would like to purchase some computer cords for pennies on the dollar, go there and pick them up. If you like vintage items or simply would like to set up an office with inexpensive equipment that will get the job done the NextStep store is the place to go. If you need to recycle your computer, printer, cell phone or any other electronic item simply drive up and drop it off with the friendly volunteers at the recycling warehouse. They&apos;ll make sure it ends up in the proper place. Be prepared for the $5 fee if you are dropping off a printer. The website works well, is easy to use and informative. Additionally, the eBay site has some great items that are very reasonably priced and I&apos;ll bet you could probably pick your eBay purchase up locally to save on shipping. If you have tech skills, or would like to develop some, and would like to contribute to the cause, I&apos;m sure NextStep&apos;s staff can find a volunteer position for you. We should be proud of the volunteers that contribute their valuable time to this grass roots organization. Eugene needs this business to be successful and because of its management&apos;s unselfish ways it certainly will be. Please support them, they do good work.\\n\\nP.S. according to their publicly available tax documents. They had outgoing grants in the form of $112,500 (charity that Next Step gave) and a total income after expenses income of Negative $20,540 in 2011.\\n\\nI wonder if RatB tried to return his parts.",

I arrive with my old drive in hand so I can be sure to get an exact replacement, and I am told they only sell unrepaired 360 consoles. Now, I have volunteered for them in the past, so I know they strip numerous 360s every week, so it wasn&apos;t hard to believe the woman on the phone who was so insistent that I could just buy parts I needed. I ended up having to buy an entire broken console for $15, and when I brought it home they had obviously never even opened the housing to try and repair it! It&apos;s not right for them to take people&apos;s trash and stick it on a shelf for sale. It&apos;s not right for them to lie to customers on the phone just to trick them into coming in. My two broken 360s are now in the trash can - they will not be resold again! What a waste of $15 and two hours of bus riding.",

Since then, all three of my boys have attended Kumon. What really stuck out to me was how much Ms. Das was invested in my boys. Her ability to identify my sons&apos; strengths and weaknesses was an integral part of their progress. The team of educators that she has is very good and they have remained consistent throughout. In the 6 years that I have been there, I have seen little to no staffing changes, which is very beneficial to a child&apos;s progress. I highly recommend Kumon-West Little Rock to anyone considering it. Thank you Kumon for everything that you have done for my three boys!!",

There wasn&apos;t a question that we asked that she didn&apos;t have an answer to.  I learned more about real estate in 18 hours than I did in my entire online real estate class.  When I take my next class I will definitely take it with Tom Rhoads.",

The driving instructors are so good &amp; patient &amp; made her feel very comfortable &amp; confident driving. Right after she finished her driving skills lessons we scheduled her state driving skills test. She passed it with confidence. Got her REAL federal ID license immediately. I would highly recommend Thompson&apos;s driving school to anyone who has a beginner driver. They were awesome. I could go on &amp; on. So thankful we made this investment in our child&apos;s driving future. Thanks Thompson&apos;s Driving School!!!",

This school has tore my spirit up due to unprofessional friendships between staff and students which in turn cause you to not have clients like the friend of welcome desk. The education is sub part and 98% of the time we don&apos;t even get to use real product. All that I find valuable in the school is the name. There are a few shining jewels of teachers but they have slowly started firing the ones who actually cared about the students once we got the newest director who has family on the staff",

I got two shampoos in addition to the haircut, one before and one after.  \\n\\nThe icing on the cake is that military gets free haircut.  Be prepared to tip your stylist well with cash if you are military.  They don&apos;t allow you to use your card to tip the stylists.",

So much gossiping, joking around, singing and basically I felt like I was just one of those mannequin heads they practice on. Seems like the students should be taught when you make a mistake you don&apos;t announce it for all to hear but instead go find your instructor and quietly tell them what you did wrong. It doesn&apos;t make the customer feel confident about the service they are receiving. The young lady that first introduced herself to me was very sweet but really unsure of herself which is understandable. There were two students working on coloring my hair and neither had a clue as to what they were doing. The instructor left them to their own devices and when she did come back she had to take over because the bleach had been on for quite a while and she had to correct their mistakes. I don&apos;t really blame the students because they didn&apos;t really seem to have a lot of instruction. It took over four hours for them to do my hair and since they were closing they didn&apos;t get to the cut. The color didn&apos;t achieve what was intended but I didn&apos;t really expect it to. But I am pleased with the results. The instructor seems to know her stuff and ended up doing the majority of my color. I would say the main thing I was disappointed in was the lack of professionalism.",

Basically the young lady who answered the phone says you can just come in and find out, there may or may not be someone who can perform your services. I am not going to waste a trip for a maybe. I understand systems may be down, but to tell me you&apos;re in the back and can not see who is on the floor does not help at all. I would not have minded to be placed on hold while she checked. It would be so much easier for her to go find out then for me to make a trip only to be turned away. The guest is not at fault because the system is down and should not be punished. Good guest services is very important and I did not receive that. I contacted the school to report what took place and was told that the Sales Leader would contact me. That never happened, places that don&apos;t value customers do not get repeat business. Haven&apos;t been back since.",

We have had the experience of several of the teachers and each have been just amazing. \\n\\nHe has shown tremendous improvement in all areas of early childhood development - vocabulary and language, reading, writing, numbers, geography and overall social skills. All credit goes to the dedicated teachers, the Montessori curriculum and the class environment this school has created for children.\\n\\nThe great thing about this school is that it is nothing like a typical day-care. It follows a popular Montessori system where teachers follow a curriculum to teach specific skills to children based on their age and ability. The flexible system allows children to pick up on things they love to do, master it and then move on to something new.\\n\\nI found the school environment homey &amp; comfortable yet professional and safe. The classes are big and bright with tons of educational material.\\n\\nAnother thing I love about this school is that the teachers are very honest with you and work with you to help your child in areas that they need extra help with. Teachers consistently encouraged our child, fed his appetite for new and exciting learning needs, provided feedback and involved parents through out the school year via activities. \\n\\nOur son is in a safe and very nurturing environment, he is learning and having fun at the same time. What more could parents ask for? We strongly recommend this school to our friends and neighbors all the time.",

I mean, they have coffee!\\n\\nThe Innovation Hub is a rare kind of business - it&apos;s a Maker Space, Collaborative Workspace, Meeting Space, Class and Lecture space, event space...\\nMore than anything, it&apos;s just a giant collection of varied and profound potential. It&apos;s a giant toolbox waiting to be used. And not just as a physical space, there are tons of resources for people who want to build prototypes, apply for patents, learn new skills, or just play around.\\n\\nSpaces like this aren&apos;t new, but they&apos;ve been popping up all over the country as Startups/Innovators/Entrepreneurs are becoming more common than they&apos;ve been in decades. Where the &quot;ARHub&quot; stands out from most though is that it sprang out of the ground with generous funding and pure-gold real-estate, allowing it to be centrally located and valuable to people who would use it, right away. \\nMost other areas rely on donations and crowd-funding to open and maintain these spaces, and are almost never as stable or have quite so many resources as ours does. The ARHub also deserves special notice for the attention it&apos;s gotten from other groups in Arkansas, from state Colleges to local and regional Politicians and Foundations.\\n\\nI could go on all day here, but I&apos;ll stop at that because there&apos;s just too much to cover. Let me just say it&apos;s absolutely worth coming in to check it out - even for the building itself, and to grab a cup of coffee while you&apos;re there, let alone the classes, events and resources available.\\n\\nSome resources are available for free, the classes in particular, and the building itself are more or less open to use. That also includes some of the individual coaching and grants they have. The tools and materials areas you do have to pay for, and they have monthly memberships and - if I&apos;m not mistaken - short term options for using the spaces.\\n\\nTop marks!",

There are certified teachers in each classroom, and the children that attend learn a tremendous amount of material, while having lots of fun at the same time.\\n\\nMy 5 year old daughter has learned basic reading, she can speak about 50 words of Spanish, can do basic arithmetic, and can recite a lot of basic historical information. The staff and teachers are fantastic and I can&apos;t say enough good things about them. I don&apos;t think you could find a better preschool in the state of Arkansas.",

I called at around 9am to schedule an appointment, and they got me in for 9:15am. I was seen quickly after checking in at the front desk &amp; filling out some paperwork. I was given a skin consultation, and the student recommended a &quot;relaxing facial&quot; based on my current skin condition.\\nGetting situated to get the facial was quick &amp; easy, and the facial itself was amazing. This facial also included arms, hands, neck &amp; shoulder massage which was so good! The process lasted about 1 hour, and at the end of it, the student went over with me a couple skin imperfections she noticed under close examination.\\nOverall, this was a very pleasant experience",

The student we had was Morgan. She. Was. Awesome. She took her time with my daughter, washed her hair, cut and styled for $19. The only reason I didn&apos;t give 5 stars is the inconvenience of not allowing us to use debit cards to tip. While she was getting cut I had to leave go get cash so I could properly tip our student. She earned it, she deserved it. So head warning....BRING CASH. As far as the result, it was perfect and we will be back to see Morgan!",

            "description": "I have been to TSPA 3 times to give them my business. \\n First time I just wanted a blow-out for an event later that evening. I got there at 4 since my event was at 7 giving me plenty of time to get home and dressed, I thought! \\n I got there at 4, seated around 4:15. I should have seen the writing in the wall when the girl started washing my hair. She had no idea what she was doing and was killing me by pulling my hair! Everyone one around me was getting a head massage and I&apos;m trying not to cry! \\n I&apos;ll try to make this short...when she FINALLY got my hair brushed out she grabbed the blow-dryer. She had a comb and was combing my hair straight down and holding the dryer at the crown of my head straight down. Burning the &amp;@$! Out of my scalp. I finally stopped her, asked her if she had a round roll brush and showed her how to do it! She still wasn&apos;t getting it. I finally asked if she could get someone else to finish since it was by the 6:00!\\nA director or somebody did finish it and I got out of there about 6:20 and had to rush to try and make it home and to my event. Worst part? It cost me more than what I&apos;ve paid at salons! I was peeved from the experience and the cost. \\n Another experience was I took my sis-in-law who&apos;s on a strict budget for a haircut. Her girl was good but didn&apos;t listen to her and cut all her hair off. I knew she wasn&apos;t listening to us. We told her several times, no length cut off! It was above her shoulders. \\n So while happy-scissors was cutting my sis-in-laws hair they kept trying to talk me into a service. Against my better judgment I let them do a pedicure. I couldn&apos;t believe I got the same girl again! Blow-out girl! Needless to say. Same situation more or less. Nothing like a pedicure I&apos;ve had before. Took FOREVER not a good job and almost cost double what I&apos;m used to paying. \\n I will NOT go back. Not when I can go to a professional for the same price and half the time! \\n They do a great job on the older women&apos;s hair though!!",

Don&apos;t go to a school to get your hair done if you don&apos;t want to spend a longer time there than other salons-- they have to be checked for their work bc they&apos;re still learning! Wouldn&apos;t you want a doctor to learn what they&apos;re doing with another senior doctor present before they cut you open all by themselves with NO direction? Yeah me too even if it took a second longer. Also it&apos;s cheaper so you can make a day there getting pampered all the way around!",

They hard sell you on services and products from the first phone call till you get out the door. Calling to book an appointment for a color? Be prepared to get pressured to get an &quot;extra conditioning shot&quot; for $7, or a &quot;shot&quot; for hair that&apos;s straightened or blown dry excessively.  (BTW services are slightly higher than what&apos;s listed on their website). Before coloring, they want to sell you on a &quot;stripping&quot; shampoo service to remove all the products from your hair so the color will adhere better. Don&apos;t forget the Redkin shampoo, conditioner and styling products they use then try and push on you to buy before leaving. In addition to the services, I was asked to participate in a bake sale, buy tickets for a fashion/hair show at $10 a pop, and to buy tickets for a Lyme disease fundraiser for coupons for discount services. The sales part was exhausting and just by the sheer volume of sales pitches, they know you are going to be worn down. \\nThe services were ok (I had an all over color), but took twice as long as at your regular salon due to needing to get an &quot;educator&quot; to come check their work at every interval. I definitely spent less money than at my regular colorist, but the time services took and sales pressure definitely took away from my experience here.",

Visibly pregnant, the student (Angel) was very patient with me. She made sure I was comfortable, explained to me  the products she suggested (and why) and the services she performed, before she did them. I went to save money because I planned get braids soon after (also because it is a chore to wash my own hair at nine months pregnant), but the service was so great, I decided to opt out of braids and book another appointment with Angel. The only downside is that the students have to wait for  instructor approval, other than that I was extremely satisfied with the service and the end result! If you go I suggest that ask for Angel, she was awesome!",

I have taken several CPR/BLS classes over the years and was impressed with the overall experience here. The instruction, equipment, facilities, and amenities offered are all top-notch, and at an affordable price. Our instructor Kevin is an experienced paramedic who has worked both locally and internationally. He was both knowledgeable and courteous- tailoring the information and instruction according to our specific levels while maintaining an atmosphere that was fun yet professional. He made sure we understood the material and took time to see that our questions were answered completely. The instructors who work here have very diverse skill sets and experience, (Paramedic, Firefighter-EMT, Nurse.. to name a few.) Whether you are someone with no prior medical experience, a seasoned medical professional, or fall somewhere in between, you are certain to leave your class having learned new information. The training rooms here are well equipped, clean, have an ocean view, and complementary local coffee is provided gratis. I also learned that Rapid Rescue is currently working on community health education projects, such as their upcoming &quot;CPR for All&quot; event where community members will be able to learn life-saving skills free of  charge. You can tell that is an organization with good ethics who is providing quality education that will benefit our responders, providers, and our communities. Thanks again for going above and beyond, Rapid Rescue!",

The office is routinely cleaned and sanitized and outfitted with microbe-blasting UV technology in each training room, and masks are required with temp checks.  I felt safe.

The freshmen get their own area where a majority of their classes are located, so it&apos;s a nice transition into high school (especially for me, who came from a private elementary and middle school). They do have the IB Program here, which I was a part of for my freshmen, sophomore, and junior year. However, I dual enrolled myself at Valencia [Community] College my senior year.\\n\\nI had to drop a couple stars because the administrative staff were so uninviting every time I had to go to them for something. I got a detention because I missed school due to a dead car battery, even though I called them and told my situation. They were very unforgiving, regardless of the fact that I had the paperwork from my mechanic. You can act as polite and respectful as possible to these people, but they all seem like they got you-know-whats up their you-know-where.\\n\\nI don&apos;t know how it is now. This review is only for the time I spent there. To be honest, I&apos;m glad to be out of Kissimmee.",

I must have an easy way in and  out (get your mind out of the gutter). Tonight was a dance gala at the school. Plenty of parking. Very easy to find. And also impressed with the schools auditorium. Very nice set up. Bigger than I expected and the sound quality was awesome within the venue. Clean restrooms were also a surprise. Gateway has been here for years and yet I was the one to add this to Yelp last night. Wish I knew more about its education and the area. The area seems nice. When the event was done there were several door to exit from and leaving the parking lot was a breeze. Nice and simple. Every venue should be this easy.",

While I was having a meeting with the director, she continued to interrupt me and yelled at me. when I addressed her yelling at me, she said &quot;it&apos;s because you&apos;re getting upset with me&quot;. I then set up a meeting with the owner of the Mustard Seed Location and the Ark location. During that meeting she could not explain where my money was going and why it was being pulled incorrectly. She then continued to say that my &quot;money doesn&apos;t even pay the bills&quot;. Go to take my son in the next day after the meeting and was greeted with being told my son can not come in the building. Teachers are amazing! The staff is very irresponsible.",

Annette takes training courses to keep up with the latest information regarding Child Care, Licensing,  and Early Education.   \\nShe is a qualified,  certified Preschool Teacher (California teaching permit).  \\n\\nI would personally enroll my child in Annette&apos;s program if they were her age group.",

            "description": "My son attended pre school at Wiggles and Giggles and first impression was that the teacher, Miss Annette was difficult to talk to and her home is overstocked with random yelping animals but she seemed good with children. I left my child in her program for almost a year. during this year, Miss Annette did a great deal of field trips and fun events for the kids which was welcomed but her insistence on various rules, additional costs and the obvious lack of actual care as well as the manner of which she attempted to enforce these became louder and ruder with each conversation to the point that dropping my son off because a traumatic event for both me and my 3 year old son each day. Miss Annette is a child herself in every way that she speaks to you, throwing a literal fit when you don&apos;t see eye to eye. She is impossible to work with and we felt the need to report her to licensing due to her leaving children with unauthorized supervision as well as for verbal abuse in front of kids. The state of Ca has found her guilty to these accusations and have applied legal action against her. we have since found better child care. Thank god we no longer have to deal with the daily wrath of angry Annette.",

It was definitely one of the highlights of my trip, and Pierre is really the star of the show, making an excellent experience with his knowledge and strong passion for cheese and cheese making. He&apos;s clearly living the dream, making a living doing what he truly loves, and being able to eat this amazing cheese every day! \\n\\nIf you&apos;re from abroad, you&apos;ll have the opportunity to learn about and try cheese you really cannot find outside of France, where and how they are made, and you even get to step inside his cheese aging room. \\n\\nYou then move onto the tasting, which included around 7 pieces of delicious cheese, which allows you to compare and contrast all different types of cheese, paired with different wines.  I think the whole tasting was supposed to last an hour, but ours was closer to two. \\n\\nWine, cheese, fun. Highly recommend!",

The workers at Paroles de Fromagers set us up with an affordable reservation they happen to have available the day of, and upon arrival, they gave us a tour around the shop (it&apos;s small, but there&apos;s lots to look at!), pointing out different cheeses and how they&apos;re made. The storage room has enormous wheels of cheese bigger than I could carry if I tried, and while he explained the cheese-making process, our host also described what cheeses and wine pairings he preferred as well as different breathing techniques to properly taste each cheese and its unique bacterial flavorings. At the end of the tour and explanation, we were led downstairs into a private cellar to enjoy our personal wine and cheese boards, complete with the proper pairings. Each cheese was an experience of its own to taste, and each sample was unique in its flavoring and texture, as were the characteristics of the wine. Always a Manchego girl, the firmest cheese was my favorite, but I branched out and found I loved the bleu and soft sheep cheeses as well!",

Guillaume taught us how to taste various cheeses to get different flavors out of them. From breathing methods to bacteria, goat/cow/sheep, fungi, and humidity, he&apos;s an endless wealth of information!! We learned so much and in a very fun and interesting way! Absolutely. Worth.

The class was held in French and i was the only student who did not speak it so they gave me an interpreter who professionally translated everything our teacher was saying.  Speaking of  the teacher, he was very friendly, engaging and skilled . Their kitchen is huge and really well equipped. Our class i think lasted about three hours and it was  pure joy. We made two kinds of very tasty ice-cream. The process was rather complicated but it was very well explained, not rushed and it was just fun. We also made meringue, sauce and some edible decor to go with the ice-cream. Of course at the end of the class we ate our creations. It tasted really good. They gave us the recipe and step-by-step instructions to take home. \\nI would give this place ten stars. I will definitely attend more classes at the Ritz when i visit Paris next time.",

Never are you in such a position to cook this way yet I was able to bring lessons home to our own kitchen.\\n\\nThe day started with meeting the concierge who guided us &apos;behind closed doors&apos; and into the depths of the Ritz. Surprisingly, the back of house is quite nice and took me by surprise. We met our two chefs in a good size room adjacent to the main kitchen. The lesson room included a full kitchen, a large prep table, selves full of dry goods and china, and a large dinning table. From the first moment we started preparing courses and learning about every step. Wine and small dishes (we prepared) were served throughout the day. Finally, my group and our two chefs sat down for a lovely meal and interesting conversation (in English).\\n\\nA great experience.",

There was the chef and an assistant, who translated for us, non-french speaking students. This is an active class, not just a watch and learn nor a team cooking class. Each student has thier own stations and baked thier own pastry. It was the best experience we had in Paris, so much fun, exceptionally taught and in no way intimidating. Both chef and assistant were very kind, charming and entertaining. The kitchens of the Ritz Ecole are incredible. If you&apos;re unsure, just do it, it&apos;s definitely an amazing experience.",

Along the way we stopped at a fish shop and then a cheese shop before heading back to the kitchen too cook. Fred was knowledgeable and had an excellent sense of humor! The Le Foodist kitchen is clean, welcoming and beautifully designed. We enjoyed sipping wine while learning new cooking techniques and preparing our delicious meal! Getting to know our fellow classmates was also delightful! We highly recommend Le Foodist! Our cooking class was our favorite part of our trip to Paris!",

We had an amazing time and this is hands down our favorite activity while visiting Paris! \\n\\nThere were a total of 6 participants in our class which was the perfect amount for the downstairs kitchen and prep area. Our instructor Ann greeted us as soon as we arrived and set us up with aprons and our work stations. She did an amazing job of walking through all of the steps and explaining the history of some of the desserts, such as the financiers. \\n\\nDuring our time frame, we made four desserts: crème brûlée, chocolate soufflé, financiers, and crepes. The class was well paced and never felt too rushed. I really enjoyed sitting down at the beautiful dining table and enjoying our desserts with coffee and wine. My only recommendation would be if we could have treat bags to take our financiers home with us. There were many left over and I think they were all thrown away afterwards. \\n\\nI would highly recommend this class to anyone and everyone looking for a unique cooking experience in Paris!",

The hands-on part is vital, especially with this delicacy.  It&apos;s hard to learn via YouTube videos. I mean, why not learn it in France? And with a cool instructor helping you along the way. \\n\\nThe class was split up into teams, each making a different flavor:  chocolate ganache, lemon, and vanilla. With those base recipes, she taught us how to expand that to other flavorings. We then went upstairs to a large table to enjoy. There was enough to take back to your hotel.  The neighboring table made cream puffs, so we shared. I really miss these social things and was glad to enjoy this in a safe environment. \\n\\nWe had so much fun. And we got the recipe to take home to try on our own!",

Our class was led by Frederick and he was absolutely the best teacher, fun and energetic, but would kindly make sure you master your technique with good feedback. In 3 hours we made wonderful macaroons and enjoyed a lovely tea time with him afterwards. Highly recommend this to anyone venturing to Paris and interested in learning how to make local goods!",

I just finished a two-week intensive (90 min sessions, M-F) and found it very helpful for advancing my conversational French. Caroline quickly adapts the coursework to areas that will help you improve the most, so it really feels like every minute is used wisely. We worked through advanced grammar points, brushed up on some basics, and also worked through vocabulary for everyday situations which I put to work immediately while on vacation. She is very responsive over email and very kind and helpful in person-- I sent her an email from the US a few weeks before my trip and was able to schedule all of the sessions in advance. Looking forward to studying again with Caroline next time I&apos;m in Paris!",

My objective was a basic review of my French knowledge and to develop confidence in speaking French as an intermediate French learner in a French environment.  I feel I accomplished those objectives.  Caroline was professional, knowledgeable and friendly.  She quickly worked out a plan for our classes to concentrate on my weaknesses.  We barely spoke English at all, which is what I wanted.  It was great to have someone to review my previous day&apos;s French speaking experiences to correct or improve how to handle a similar situation in the future.  Each day&apos;s class flew by far too quickly.  I hope that I can repeat the experience in the future.  It was a very positive experience.  Don",

The dive shop itself has a huge show room and they even have their own pool with a 14 foot deep end.  The staff  are very friendly and extremely knowledgeable.  I got a private four dive session with full gear rental for less than $300.  Andrew was my instructor and is just a flat out super cool guy.  So much so that I&apos;m looking at going on one of their group dive trips mainly to dive with him again.  They even found a mask for my girlfriend who has been diving for years with mask issues.  I highly recommend them for people just getting into the sport or veterans alike.  Thanks again Andrew!!",

I have 2 boys (2 and 3) and I have been a stay at home mom since I was pregnant with my first. I have never left them with anyone outside of immediate family, and even then, there were a select few with strict privileges. I wasn&apos;t crazy about the busy location at first, however once I stepped inside- wow! They have put our kids learning at the  forefront of their minds! They are allowed to play with slime, water, birdseed, paint.... everything I WANT my kids to play with but it&apos;s in a controlled environment so I don&apos;t have to worry about it destroying my house.  ; ) They have lesson plans and meal plans (geared towards our kids and homemade ) and the sisters who run this facility, along with all of the teachers I have met, are top notch. I love their reasons for starting this daycare, i love their interactions with my shy children and I love the comfort level they give me as a parent leaving their child for the first time. I drive 53 mInutes a day to take my kids here, and I will do it every day to get this level of care!",

            "description": "We went to an open house at Full Sail for the youngest who is interested in Game Art Design.  She had spoken to them on the phone for over an hour and they had her very excited for the program.  They told her they had scholarships that would cover most, of not all, of her tuition.  They also told her they would help with housing, as they do not have student housing on campus.  \\n\\nFirst, the campus is obviously well-funded.  Great.  Lots of bells and whistles and facades.  They greeted us, and a very large group of other kids/parents, and herded us into a large studio where a host and videos were hyping up the school and the projects their alumni have worked on.\\n\\nThen they broke the group down into smaller groups based on what their &quot;degree&quot; interest was.  They took them into classrooms with laptops and gave them a sample lesson on game design and game programming.  Thank goodness they had student helpers as most of the kids were lost as it went so fast.\\n\\nDuring this time I did some research online about the school and unfortunately wished I had done it prior to making the drive from Jax.  From what I read and what we witnessed, most, if not all, of the &quot;teachers&quot; are former students.  They don&apos;t have teaching degrees and some do not have real-life experience in what they are teaching other than going to classes.\\n\\nThe admissions director gave a talk and then brought out former alumni for a roundtable session.  There was not a Q&amp;A session, which I found somewhat odd.\\n\\nWe were fed a catered lunch and then sent back to another area for specific information.  They had info on housing, admissions, financial aid, and general questions.\\n\\nI asked in admissions what their graduation rate was and was told, &quot;well, if you look it up online it will show 30%, but it&apos;s really closer to 60-70%&quot;.  The rationale behind this is that it is a 20-month program, and very few finish in that time, therefore skewing their results. Uh, no, it is what it is.\\n\\nMy daughter asked about housing assistance, and they told her she could take out a loan for rent.  My daughter said, &quot;I&apos;m not been adulting very long but even I knew this was not a smart idea.&quot;\\n\\nAnd don&apos;t even ask about credits transferring as you will get the most convoluted answer, if any at all.  They do not offer any classes where the credits will actually be accepted by an accredited university.  This is a big red flag to me.\\n\\nAnd now tuition - you won&apos;t get a straight answer about that either, but I finally did get someone to say that it&apos;s around $91,000 for the program my daughter was interested in.  $91K?  For 20 months.  And they expect you to go to class 40 hours a week, and then most work an additional 10-20 hours per week on projects.  So, you&apos;re never going to be able to work during school, like so many have to to pay for expenses.\\n\\nAll in all, it sounds great and looks great, but just not the school for us.  First, the cost.  Second, you can&apos;t transfer any credits, so if you end up hating what you&apos;ve started, you have to start over at zero.  Third, it just felt more like a timeshare presentation, and no one really wanted to give straight answers to the more pertinent questions.  Do your research.  Maybe it works out well for some.  Obviously they&apos;re doing something right as they&apos;ve been in business for 40 years, but it is a for-profit college, and that alone tells you a lot.",

I attended in 2014/15 but I withdrew for person reasons and years later I chose a different program and the experience is good. In the new program, I spoke to other students that started out online, were given equipment for the class and the tuition was less tan on campus students. So I emailed the person in charge with questions on this, months went by and I never got a response and today August 8, 2022, i am still waiting. Communication is horrible here, no one answers the phone, replies to emails and overall communication is almost obsolete, I have been considering withdrawing again and going down the street to UCF, I am sure they won&apos;t neglect their students. So, my advice or my take of Full Sail, it&apos;s fun but it&apos;s not, once you&apos;re in, they stop actually communicating with you. So all in all, don&apos;t waste your money here unless you are a music person, it isn&apos;t worth it, go somewhere else....I&apos;m sure after this, my email and phone will start ringing",

They&apos;re not in the business of helping you get in the industry when it comes to Audio. They have so many loopholes it&apos;s ridiculous; financial aid, poor communication, grade pilfering, no accountability for their mistakes. \\n\\nIf you are a parent be careful sending your child here. I would definitely reconsider getting a degree in the Audio Production program. I had success on my own as producer, I came to Full Sail to explore audio engineering. They tried their best to help with getting students acclimated to the music industry but they are not keeping up with technology. They don&apos;t even teach anything on creating NFT&apos;s (although new) this can create independence. I introduced the business teacher to audio NFT&apos;s, I was an online student. I had previous background in I.T, so I already came with my AS degree. But that is when I noticed the first red flag, they tried to give me a hard time with my prior transcript. Insinuating  that I will have to pay out of pocket. I had a 4.0 GPA, once I declined, they called me back and magically the out of pocket fee disappeared! \\n\\nDon&apos;t be fooled by their advertisements and sale pitches... make sure you do your due diligence if you decide to embark on this journey. They will profile you, and they definitely aren&apos;t good in discerning good students from others. They just show favoritism to whoever stays a sheep, they let the blind lead the blind. \\n\\nComputer graphics and animation is what brings in the most revenue for them at the moment. But that will soon change once all the students start to attend, like the music programs. They do a good job in selling dreams but their graduation rate in my program was around 50-60%. This is something to factor into your decision. The tuition will be high regardless, they justify that by being For-Profit. They take a lot from you and give back the bare minimum. Do the math, even after the pandemic and adding a student advocacy program to help the students it doesn&apos;t suffice. You have to wait four months to get your launch box, and watch them give lectures on old software. The equipment they give doesn&apos;t even add up to 30% of your tuition.... So your paying for the name of school, and the experience with the teachers. If you get the right ones, you may get people who have 20-30 years experience, or you may get a teacher who has very little. These extremes are difficult for any student to cope with, especially if you have a family or a personal life. Don&apos;t let them treat you like another fictitious entity... another student online at the factory being warehoused until they get you a job. It is very unfortunate to see how they let the bad outweigh the good.",

After each test session, it can either last for an hour, 2 hours or even 4 hours sometimes. You complete a survey and you&apos;re done.\\n\\nYou can get compensated PSN/XBL gift cards or even Publix gift cards. Though I never got compensated for any of that. Most of the times I get the &apos;GPS&apos; points added to my report.\\n\\nWhat is GPS? It&apos;s a Global Professionalism Standard (GPS) program where every student takes part in. If you don&apos;t do assignments (mostly due to family issues, your job or other issues), if you don&apos;t follow the policies and procedures, etc you get points deducted for your GPS.\\n\\nSo if you do go for GPS points instead of getting a XBL/PSN or Publix gift cards, you can get this to get your score back to &apos;100&apos; if for some reason you missed some assignments in class due to personal reasons (most of the times Professors don&apos;t allow makeup work, so this is your best option).\\n\\nManagement at the UX lab is pretty dull and lacking. I never got a phone call or email to inform me to get my gift cards, I never get emails responded back to me and oddly enough you never get called back to do more testing (they come to you, well the classrooms and ask for sign-ups).",

That&apos;s just about the only thing good to say.\\n\\nThis is not a school, it&apos;s a marketing cult for them to just make money and when you attend the school, you never see where your money goes. They can&apos;t even warm up the pizza during a school event. Which by the way, there&apos;s only two school events where anyone can come together (both of which the staff just promote themselves and try to make even more money). \\n\\nI attended the Media Communications program here and graduated in 2018. During my time, I experienced the worst &quot;teachers&quot; ever. They aren&apos;t even teachers because anything they say, you could just look up on YouTube or Google. The only thing they really excel in is favoritism. They select a few students and only talk about them, only use their examples, and even go as far as to cry just at the mention of their names. They also send them on trips and go to the beach with them. They call the whole student body a &quot;family&quot; but they only pay attention to like 4 people. I had attended the school for a year, and the program director didn&apos;t even know my name when I walked by, despite me emailing her several times and trying to hold conversations and the program being small enough that she should know my name.\\n\\nI had an issue with a teacher who forgot to grade any of my work, so I got an F for the month because he had no grades posted. He was impossible to get ahold of, so I contacted the program director who had no advice for me. She just assured me that he is a &quot;very good teacher&quot;. They are in complete denial over their fake and biased program. \\n\\nThe teachers even post about their favorite students on their personal Instagram&apos;s. It&apos;s a joke. And they only give internships/career opportunities to their favorites.\\nThere is no community feel on campus, either. You just go to class and leave. It&apos;s not inviting. It&apos;s a waste of the college experience. \\n\\nLet me talk about the absolute worst part of this program. Friday Blend. This is a mandatory 4 hour session almost every Friday where students are supposed to learn, but instead teachers use this time to highlight their favorite students, sing happy birthday, hug, and have little games and groups where they make the students feel like they&apos;re in Kindergarten. And yes, it&apos;s mandatory. There is even a mandatory Christmas party, and if you don&apos;t go you&apos;ll fail your month of class. Nothing is learned in this. Friday blend is also where MCBS likes to appreciate the students who are about to graduate, and they start crying and taking pictures of the graduates, but only if they like you. If you&apos;re a favorite. If you&apos;re not, expect zero emotion or care. It&apos;s a huge waste of four hours of class time that is required for attendance. \\n\\nDuring my two years at full sail, I learned nothing at all, except don&apos;t try to be nice to people who won&apos;t ever care about you. I tried to be nice to the faculty in MCBS and on graduation day, I walked by them after the ceremony, and none of them even congratulated me. It wouldn&apos;t have been too hard to congratulate me considering there were only 8 graduates. \\n\\nOverall I could have dealt with the lack of community and the money grabs, after all what college doesn&apos;t want your money? However the MCBS program was just horrifying and I can&apos;t even believe things like that are allowed to happen. Maybe it&apos;s different in other degrees, who knows.\\n\\nAwful, awful place. Oh and not to mention since I finally escaped this place, they won&apos;t stop emailing me and calling me to see if I even graduated! Shows how much they actually recognize the students worth.",

            "description": "This is a for-profit school, and you should really think about before making your decision to come here. \\n\\nI attended Full Sail from 2003-2005 and graduated with a Recording Arts A.S, and Entertainment Business B.S. \\n\\nThe campus itself is incredible. There is no other school providing such a high-end facility to students. However, you get very limited access to these facilities (in my experience, it was less than 2 months of the entire 24month program that I even accessed the studios). \\n\\nAlso - this is not a regionally accredited school. So if you have any plans to further your education anywhere other than Full Sail once you&apos;re finished, your credits will not transfer. So in my case I would like to get a Master&apos;s Degree, however my only option would be to get it from Full Sail. Otherwise I would need to make up a LOT of credits before I would even be eligible for a Master&apos;s program at another school. \\n\\nLast, the school is VERY expensive. If your parents are willing to pay for it, that is one thing. I did not have that luxury and took out student loans (nearly $100k) to pay for my school and living expenses for 2 years. These were privatized loans, some with interest as high as 13%. At 18 years old I was too young, naive, and excited to realize what that meant as far as payments after graduation, and I soon found myself with an expected $1,000/month student loan bill. As a new graduate looking for my first job, this was very steep, and I soon found myself resorting to deferment and other options to delay these payments (only further compounding the total cost). \\n\\nWhile there are some degree programs from Full Sail with lots of job potential, there are many with very limited jobs. For example, Full Sail has been pumping out 200+ students each month from their audio program for the past 15+ years. There are not nearly that many studio or audio industry jobs. As you will find, most Full Sail graduates have resorted to finding work in alternate industries (myself included). \\n\\nThat all said, I learned a lot at Full Sail, and aside from mainly the cost, it was a positive experience. For those that take the classes seriously (only about 50%) there is much to learn and gain from your time there. However, overall it was very  unprofessional (felt more like a highschool than a college), and you don&apos;t earn a real accredited degree for the time and money that you spend. \\n\\nI would very strongly consider other options before recommending Full Sail to anyone else.",

They offer everything from GED classes to prepare you for your diploma, to classes to help you learn english. They offer classes during the day and also several classes at night. I went here to enroll my daughter for GED classes and were met by some really great employees in the front office who explained the whole process and cost to us. They made the process quick and painless. The campus we are using is on Simpson Road across from the jail. It has easy access and a large parking lot with multiple handicapped spots. There is also a bus stop down the road. They also offer several certificate programs that we are going to look into next. Great place to the community.",

I was excited to check them out. \\n\\nI just peeked in the studio and galleries at lunch, but this place is awesome! It is very informal, you just walk in and check out the space! I only saw artists, but the lady I spoke with encouraged me to mingle and if I had any questions to talk to any of the artists. Cool! The prices were around $20 and up per piece, depending upon how large and intricate they are. \\n\\nThey offer studio space, membership, and classes on site! I&apos;ll be back to check them out in more detail!",

It truly didn&apos;t resemble any campus that I have ever been on .... which appears to be a good thing. \\nI entered the whimsical house that was designated as the &quot;Fashion&quot; building and was charmed by the small yet inspiring Fashion program that they have her. The students all seemed motivated by the curriculum and as I reviewed some of the work and projects that they did, I was delighted to know that we have a higher learning experience like this in our community.\\n\\nAfter doing more research, I am able to report that they offer:\\nFashion Design\\nInterior Design\\nFine Arts\\nLiberal Arts\\nand Visual Communication all in their curriculum. \\n\\nTheir website is very functional and offers clear insight on the courses and scholarship or financial aid info along with tuition outlines too. \\n\\nI have been really impressed with my interaction with the staff there and motivated students with our intern program!",

            "description": "As a second semester senior, I think I am fairly well-acquainted with O&apos;More (hah, weren&apos;t expecting that, were you?).\\n\\nOriginally, I had planned on getting as far away from Nashville as I could for college (which was going to be SAIC in Chicago), but because of cost issues, I ended up living at home for college. Honestly, when I applied here, I felt like I was settling, but now that I&apos;ve gone through the entire program, I can say that this was the best &apos;touch of Fate&apos; that could have happened to me. \\n\\nI do not like large college institutions with thousands of students enrolled where the classes are large lecture halls where teachers don&apos;t know your name. O&apos;More keeps their enrollment at around 200-300 students and the class room sizes really depend on what kind of class you&apos;re taking (gen. ed. or specific to your major). I&apos;ve had a class with only 3 students (including myself) and I&apos;ve had classes with as many as 25 in them, but the professors know you by name.\\n\\nThe classes have changed every year I&apos;m there, but they get better because of the changes. The staff changes almost every semester, but again, it&apos;s for the better and it&apos;s usually only one or two changes in staff.\\n\\nOne of the things I adore about this school is that the president, Dr. Mark Hilliard, teaches classes! I took a class with him in my junior year (which actually ended up being my favorite and most fun class that semester), I just don&apos;t know of many college presidents that teach classes at their institutions.\\n\\nThere are a few clubs at the school (SGA, a Green club, a Film Club, and my personal favorite: the O&apos;More Supper Club), and we do have several social events every year, but participation can be spotty. Students coming here aren&apos;t necessarily looking for a social scene until they hit their junior year (when the realize they do want to be in the social scene), but when we do have a party, we like to get down.\\n\\nAnd if you&apos;re worried about it being a vocational school as opposed to a liberal arts school, I want to let you know that O&apos;More offers a very well-rounded curriculum (at least in the Fashion department). I&apos;ve taken lots of sewing and illustration classes, but I&apos;ve also taken writing courses, life/family courses, psychology courses, and several business courses, as well as multiple art and art history courses.\\n\\nPossibly one of my favorite things about this school is the opportunity for world-travel during the summer; after you complete 60 hours, you have the opportunity to take a trip to several different locations that the school plans out. And the cool thing is that it might not be as expensive as you&apos;d think because you pay a &apos;globalization fee&apos; every year that goes towards these trips. This past summer, I participated in the trip to Italy and it was a life-changing experience! I had so much fun and saw so many amazing places.\\n\\nAlso, the fact that the campus (which is insanely beautiful and cozy) is practically a stone&apos;s throw away from downtown Franklin is a definite plus. There are no dorms, but they do have you fill out roommate forms and connect you with students you&apos;d be compatible with, as well as give you a ton of information about surrounding apartments; however, they have acquired the &apos;Bell Historic Franklin&apos; property for student housing for next semester.\\n\\nI could rave on and on about this school, but you&apos;re probably tired of reading this, hah.

            "description": "The gun range is close to my house and having just bought my first personally-owned pistol I was very anxious to try it out and see how it shot. This was a close option although I had heard from several friends not to go there due to the &quot;range Nazis&quot; I decided to go and see for myself. \\n\\nThis is an extremely safe range. $8 to shoot for 2 hours and you can rent your protection and eye/ear protection and all kinds of other various shooting accoutrements like sand bags should you need them this is a plus you are checked in and off the range by the safety officers making sure that your weapon is unloaded and properly cased etc. all this is good.\\n\\nThe RSOs ran the range properly, however, I take major issue with how I was treated. It may be my first personally-owned pistol but I&apos;m not a newbie to shooting, nor am I a newbie to shooting pistols and just because I&apos;m female does not mean I&apos;m ignorant. The guys HOVERED. My weapon kept jamming and misfiring and yes it was frustrating but they stepped up immediately, 2-3 of them took my gun from me and did all sorts of things with it without permission.\\n\\nCourtesy Rule #1 do nor assume I want your help,ask. For the record, I did not. I really just wanted to be left alone.\\n\\nCourtesy Rule #2 do not hover, there is a thing called personal space and within 1 foot you are violating that. These guys were literally a foot away from me at all times it was nerve-racking\\n\\nCourtesy Rule #3 DO NOT TOUCH MY WEAPON OR EQUIPMENT WITHOUT MY PERMISSION!  I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m even having to type this. This is my weapon I don&apos;t know you I don&apos;t want your hands on it without my giving you permission you do not touch other people&apos;s things without asking. One of the RSOs asked if I was done shooting as I was doing something on my phone and I said yes. He says &quot;well here let&apos;s just do this&quot; and he packed up everything into my case and shut it as I stared at him dumbfoundedly and says &quot;there once you go get your target you can just leave.&quot;\\n\\nI could not believe he would have the audacity to not only one be rude like that to pack up my weapon without my permission\\n\\nI will not be returning.

I hope it won&apos;t be his last.\\n\\nWhen my friend told me we were going to a shooting range while in Nashville for her bachelorette party, I, of course, thought it was the most brilliant thing I had ever heard.  Up until then, I had never fired a gun before.  In fact I had never even imagined myself shooting a gun but once the plans were set, it became my mission to find the perfect shooting outfit to complete my first timer experience (eventually landing on cowboy boots, an american flag/eagle tshirt and jean vest, topping it all off with bright red lipstick of course).\\n\\nWe arrived shortly before 10AM for a scheduled four hour session with Jeff.   He was pretty laid back in his approach which was perfect for a group of 11 girls who were already moving slow on a ridiculously hot day post booze ingestion the day/night before.  That&apos;s not to say Jeff was so relaxed that he didn&apos;t go over all the major safety concerns, and how to handle a gun properly to avoid any accidents.  He routinely reminded us to keep the gun pointed away from us, and other people and never have our fingers on the trigger until we&apos;re ready to fire.  Even with the gun not loaded, I was pretty sure I was going to shoot myself in the foot.  Jeff&apos;s son was also there to assist us and keep things moving along in what turned about to be one of the most fun bachelorette events I&apos;ve attended.  \\n\\nWe started by getting acquainted with some handguns and revolvers, shooting at predators of the paper male variety.  I have to admit that although Jeff warned us of the kickback, I was completely terrified and ill-prepared for the kickback of my gun when I first fired it.  I was a bit deterred at first and wasn&apos;t sure I was even going to continue, but with a little persuasion from Jeff, all of us got over our initial shock and before we knew it we were shooting at balloons, rarely missing a shot feeling like total bad asses.  \\n\\nWe had the opportunity to fire shot guns, rifles, and hand guns, and we actually ended up leaving a bit earlier than scheduled due mostly to the heat.  I think a three hour session is probably all anyone would need to have a great time shooting the variety of guns Jeff has to offer.\\n\\nI would highly suggest to any gal planning a bach&apos; in Nashvegas to add this to the agenda.  It&apos;s a great way to get in touch with the country inside us all.\\n\\nBig thanks to Jeff and his son!  I hope this review will help drive some more bachelorettes your direction!",

As a gun-totin&apos; state, Tennessee obviously has an incentive to keep its citizens educated about the weapons they proudly lug around. As such the state has a series of public shooting ranges where they teach new gun owners and allow firing to take place under a watchful eye.  \\n\\nComing from very anti-gun states, this was one of the first things some of my buddies decided that we should try out.  For $5.50, you get 2 hours to in outdoor ranges to fire at targets up to 100 yards for rifles or 50-foot ranges for handguns.  This is probably the best place to fire a gun if you own one in Nashville: it is close, cheap, and kept under iron discipline.  A series of safety experts check and check repeatedly to make sure you don&apos;t screw up and hurt yourselves.  The guns are thoroughly inspected before firing, the ranges are strictly divided between &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cold&quot; times, and malfunctions and mistakes are instantly tackled upon; many in the range seem quite annoyed at the &quot;range nazis&quot; but I appreciated how they kept a tight ship. \\n\\nAs the closest range to Nashville, this also has the widest assortment of people and guns, ranging from students to those people of the hills.  I have encountered no issues here, and the people are generally quite friendly and may allow you to try out their weapons. \\n\\nAs much as I dislike guns, I admit it raises something primeval in me when I fire those things.  For those suburban Rambos out there, this is a pretty good spot, especially for those new at guns or simply interested in trying it out.  Otherwise there are quite a few freakier ranges scattered around Tennessee for you to make a man out of yourself.",

They are quick to help when asked. the RSO&apos;s keep a close watch over the shooters, and correct as necessary. Some people seem aggravated with the structure and commands, but after seeing the broad scope of shooters there, I am amazed they are able to do such a good job. They are definitely seasoned, and very patient. Most shooters learn and follow the rules, some are indignant. Those are the ones that make me nervous. I try to go early, to avoid the &quot;full range&quot; situation. Fridays work best, as there are usually fewer people on the ranges. \\nOne thing that I would like to see, is the &quot;range rules&quot; posted in several places. It would also help to have &quot;handouts&quot; with the rules, policies, hours, etc.\\nI paid to be an annual shooter, and am glad I did. It makes my visits much easier, as my first point of contact is at the inspection station. \\nFor anyone wanting to shoot rifle or handgun, it is a great place to go. Being outdoors, but under cover, you can shoot in almost any weather. You can bring friends and family, and is a great place to teach shooting fundamentals to your children.\\nI strongly recommend that you prepare before going, so your experience will be more enjoyable. This is not shooting on your Uncle&apos;s farm.",

Barbara was amazing and really took her time to show my partner and I gun safety. It was my partners first time shooting ever. She was so pleased with the assistance they provided. Not only that the lanes are pretty wide to fit all your material you bring. They closed, but still allowed us to finish. Barbara and her husband both assisted us and gave us good pointers. Not to mention they&apos;re pretty funny! They kept me laughing. They also know how to respect your space and leave you alone. I know some may not like that, but she only helps if asked. She did let me know she volunteers and I just hope she and her husband are there the next visit. We will be coming back, this is the most affordable range I&apos;ve found in the area as well. Everyone else is twice as much or more!",

All KINDS of things to learn! \\n\\nI took a traditional Iraqi/Kurdish cooking class- went last week. The basement of the Cohn School was a-buzz with classrooms filled with adults learning guitar, cooking, Reiki, special education advocacy - it was GREAT to see all those adult learners! \\n\\nThe Ibrahim/Suleman team are a great pair- wife/husband are parents of 3 kids, just moved to the US about 7 months ago. She prepped and cooked, he translated along the way. Last week&apos;s creation was Dolmas. Sort of like Dolmadas, stuffed grape leaves. Veggies like tomatoes, onions, green bell peppers, zucchini, eggplant. She expertly cored the veggies with a paring knife (like, perfectly), diced all the guts, then fried in oil. Added short-grained rice, garlic, spices, a can of tomato paste, then stuffed all this back into the veggies, placed them in a casserole, poured water steeped in sumac berries all over &amp; boiled it on the stove. Sumac was from Iraq; heck, I always thought sumac was poisonous - students stymied about where to find locally or even via internet. Berries very bitter, apparently, so they were tossed. Often, this is all placed on top of meats, like ribs or chicken. Our teachers went vegetarian, in case some folks were not into meat. Add fresh dill, diced tomatoes AFTER cooking. Some of the mixture was stuffed into rolls of parboiled cabbage; can also use chard, grape leaves - one student even said local fig leaves have been used. \\nAs a cool salad to accompany, she prepared cacik, a yogurt sauce similar to tzatziki, with cucumber, garlic, &amp; dried fresh mint.

The only class that wasn&apos;t full was a Sunday afternoon class &amp; to my surprise the theme was graffiti hearts! \\n(Perfect for our anniversary) There was one other guy in the class (to my husbands delight)! I felt the instructor went a bit fast, but this may just be what is required to get the painting done in the allotted time. But, she was very helpful if had any questions along the way! You just can&apos;t really be a perfectionist in this class. You more just have to go with the flow. \\nOverall, we had a great time &amp; have a wonderful memory &amp; two art piece souvenirs that we plan to hang side by side in our home office! I might add the Sunday afternoon class was fun so I can only image what the Friday or Sat night class with a few drinks might be! I would like to add I do not think you would enjoy this class if you didn&apos;t have some interest in art.",

The room was filled with laughter and chit chat as everyone worked on their own unique piece. Although they start you off with a pencil sketch template on the canvas, you are allowed to customize the portrait as you see fit. The only negative thing that I can say about this place was that we didn&apos;t start on time and were rushed to get out. Other than that I enjoyed myself thoroughly and would love to do it again!!!",

Considering its prime location in the Gulch close to me, I decided to give it a shot with some friends.  They definitely encourage a little more originality here...after painting your basic painting (selected from their calendar online) they give you other paints and even glitter (I know, I know) to play with.  Much like other classes I have attended, you can bring wine to enjoy as you paint.  They even have some paintings for sale as well.  The space in here is HUGE, and makes a great place for a group to go.  The pricing is reasonable ($30-$35 typically, with some specials for $20).  This studio, much like others, is a great place for people of all different levels of talent.  They do a good job with instruction and guidance.  I really enjoyed the location and the potential art pieces and will be back.",

I make a point to serve on an industry panel and talk to students to help as Vanderbilt helped me financially to graduate without debt and professionally to collaborate on many cool projects. Vanderbilt believes in the mission to educate without student loans by assisting any way they can. My nephew and niece both graduated without debt as well. \\n\\nProfessors are tough notch. Yeah, there are a few exceptions but overall the school cares about the quality education for the students, and professors are available and willing to help. \\n\\nWe rarely have a good football team, and I&apos;m proud that we don&apos;t follow the model of chasing money in athletics. I like Vanderbilt as an academic institution. Besides we are pretty good at tennis, golf, baseball and bowling, I hear. \\n\\nThe expansion of school made the campus to be scattered about in Nashville, but overall it is a pretty campus. Since my graduation, the buildings have been upgraded. When I was there, bathrooms smelled like it...and I was ok with it. Buildings look old and smelled it too. And I liked that too.  Now many buildings are modern and clean. I like it ok, but I miss the old quaint feel of a classic American institution. \\n\\nIf you want a small school feel with top academic reputation, diversity, and cool college experience, I recommend Vanderbilt!",

Maybe they are so busy with the audits that they can&apos;t explain a bill. They are always, however, willing to take your money, just won&apos;t tell you what it is for. If you don&apos;t pay in full there are high monthly fees. They don&apos;t tell you that there are payment plans because most of the students who attend are wealthy. I&apos;ve never seen a school that was so secretive about charges. I would urge you to consider a school that is more transparent in its charges and willing to speak to students and parents for even 5 minutes to explain charges.",

It was nice to walk campus with a guide taking a peek into residence hall, dining hall, etc. Unfortunately Vandy has fallen prey to the woke culture. They spent a LOT of time really focusing on their 1st slide of the presentation, strongly emphasizing how committed they are to equity, LGBTQ, BLM, etc. It wasn&apos;t that they value diversity and inclusion. It was a huge helping of identity politics that continued beyond slide 1, being reinforced multiple times through the presentation as well as along the tour. The LGBTQ flag was in the window leading up to the meeting, hanging in the residence hall, &amp; regularly displayed around campus. Doesn&apos;t matter to me what someone&apos;s sexual preference may be, but I want to pick a university based on their educational quality and that seemed to take a back seat in the discussions.  On a side note, the flags were the old version rather than the newer one so makes me wonder if this isn&apos;t all just an effort at virtue signaling.  Not saying Vandy is out, but it&apos;s a shame to see their focus shift so significantly.",

If you are a good student in HS or just visiting Nashville. Check this campus out its awesome. GO VANDY.",

I was changing professions to nursing and this was the closest school.  OCCC is very small - smaller than the high school I attended.  But I do not think that means the education is poor, but quite the opposite.  Most of the instructors were knowledgeable and interested in student success, and teacher: student ratios are good.  (I found one core instructor to be quite incompetent, as did the other students I was with.  That happens everywhere, though.)  Lab instructor Lynn is great.  Our clinical instructors varied quite a bit and were mostly good.  I obtained a BSN after and feel the program at OCCC was better (the BSN was from a reputable school).  I think OCCC is especially good for students who prefer the smaller campus, such as home school and some high school students who appreciate a good education but don&apos;t want to be swallowed up in a huge university or others who just don&apos;t like massive waves of students to navigate.  I give it 4.5 stars, but round up to 5.",

            "description": "Nate.\\nI am a novice surfer. I have only been surfing twenty seven times. My name is Nate. I ride a seven foot six inch bodyglove brand board that I bought off of their website. My board is called the &quot;daily.&quot; It has a plastic tri fin guidance system. Maybe you have seen me wiping out down at one of the beaches near Newport. I have a short story for you.\\nI was surfing up at Otter Rock. I had only surfed that beach twice at this point. I was putting my wetsuit on in the parking lot when I saw Russell the south beach surf shop owner guy pull up in this little blue car. I waved and thought nothing of it. It turned out that Russell was teaching surfing that day.\\nI walked down the steps to the beach and looked at the waves.\\nI decided where to put in and I stepped in the water. I put my board into the surf and paddled out and started trying to line a wave up.\\nThere were a lot of people there. It turned out that I had walked right into Idaho&apos;s spring break rush. There were a lot of surfers there of all different experience levels.\\nI was having a lot of fun. Everything was fine . I surfed for several hours with out incident.\\nThe waves were getting smaller at this point. Most of the real surfers, you know the guys on the short boards with the side bites were really far out or at least far out for me. Since the ocean was a lot calmer now I paddled towards them. I wanted to see if I could be in the big boys club for a little bit and see if I could make a little surfer friend. It gets lonely surfing by yourself.\\nI kept paddling. This weird undercurrent swept my board out towards the rocks. It felt like I was being swept out to sea. How could this be possible. Just a moment ago I was going to try to join the big boys club. I had lost total control of my board and I raced past the more experienced surfers very quickly. The look on their faces was of concern. This other guy who was a little younger than I was also got caught. We were both paddling hard and we were not budging an inch. We kept looking at each other as if to say &quot;what are we going to do now? I don&apos;t want to be shark bait.&quot; Neither of us said a word. I was embarrassed and scared.\\nPanic was almost setting in. To make it worse the only way out of this if we got any further out would be for a coast guard helicopter to pick us up. It would be embarrassing being on the six ocklock news.\\nI saw Russell paddle straight towards me out of nowhere. Russell told me that I was being swept out to sea. He put his foot on my board and guided me. Russell pointed me where to paddle and then yelled &quot;PADDLE, PADDLE!&quot; I paddled hard.\\nI got back to shore. Russell saved the other guy as well. Russell had been watching us the whole time. It turned out he told all of the guys in front of us to paddle in because of the undercurrent. He probably saved the coast guard guys a trip and he saved us all the humiliating experience of being on the news.\\nI was shocked. I went home and hosed my wetsuit and gloves and booties off. I hung up my wetsuit and gloves and let them drip dry on the front porch and then I slept for an hour.\\nAfter my little nap I decided to take the next day off. I told my mom what happened and we both agreed that I was a lucky ducky.\\nTwo days later after surfing the south jetty in Newport I went to Russell&apos;s surf shop nearby. Russell told me that I really was in danger of being swept out to sea. In the moment I wasn&apos;t sure exactly what was happening. I bought some special soft top wax for my surfboard and thanked my lucky stars. I drove home. Here I am. I am a lucky guy and Russell knows surfing.\\nThis is a one hundred percent true story. This happened in front of at least one hundred people.\\nYours truly.\\n\\nNathaniel Lentz, general manager of Springside Tree Farms.",

This shop has amazing customer service and Russell really knows his stuff. I ran into him while surfing and he stopped what he was doing just to give my friends a quick surf lesson. He will go out of his way to make sure you have the best surfing experience.

Our all day adventure started off with wonderful sunrise light and sea creatures.  Once my brain was full of new info, not only about photography, but the natural world around Newport, we had a great lunch with time to review what I&apos;d learned and what I can practice in the future.

You get a tour of the area, see some of the locals-only spots, and get tips for other places to go on your own. But Jaymi makes all this special with her fun personality, her low-key suggestions, and her passion for photography.

She showed us new photo techniques and ways to use our gear better, even though we thought our skills were already pretty advanced going in.  We even asked for a lesson in post-processing on the fly without giving her a chance to prepare and she obliged and really helped us out.  As a local area expert, she took us to great locations for wildlife, landscape, and macro, managing travel times and park permits and always getting us in and out before holiday-weekend crowds descended.  She&apos;s an expert in local biology, too:  she explained everything from fungus and plant species to seal behaviors to tidepool ecosystems to animal tracks to identifying bird calls.\\n\\nI simply can&apos;t imagine a better guide.

The day started with her cheery early morning greeting with hot beverages and snacks.  We ventured onto the beach at low tide and got a good start to the landscape side of things.  Jaymi was thoughtful and helpful in suggesting methods and views on a beach that we had entirely to ourselves.  We then started looking for wildlife and met with success beyond any possible expectation.  We found American Dippers searching for breakfast, Oystercatchers and a Western Gull finishing of an ochre sea star.  But the highlight of the day was coming across a coyote feasting on a harbor seal in a tide pool!   We highly recommend Jaymi and Oregon Coast Photo Tours!!!",

Jeff, the owner/artisan showed us countless blown glass pieces and let us choose our colors, size, etc. He is the consummate teacher as he walked us through each step of the process and didn&apos;t &apos;direct&apos; us. One &apos;student&apos; at a time so we got his undivided attention. We had a wonderful time creating &apos;floats&apos; that we&apos;ll always enjoy displaying in our home. After we see them &apos;cooled&apos; tomorrow, he&apos;ll safely ship them to ur home.\\nA stop at this artist&apos;s shop to blow your own glass art is a must!",

Through heating, rolling, twisting, and shaping glass with various tools and the use of special techniques, my son was able to bring his designs to beautiful life. Everything was done safely and in a supportive environment. \\n\\nThis was definitely the highlight of our time spent in Oregon. Artisans like Jeff help to create magical memories and give Oregon its character and unique verve.\\n\\nPlease support incredible art and artists!",

We had stopped by the place in Lincoln City (Taft) several times in the past. I searched yelp for something closer to Seal Rock (where we were staying) and The Hot Shop came up. \\n\\nWe are SOOOOO glad we decided to go here. Jeff was a great teacher and allowed us to work the glass through the entire process. From shaping to adding color to forming the float and finally blowing it up to size. Jeff provided guidance and instruction the entire time allowing us to complete our own masterpiece. \\n\\nIf you want to stand beside an employee while they create your piece and allow you to blow at the very end, then you&apos;ll be satisfied with the shop up the road. BUT if you want to work hands on with shop owner and artist Jeff by your side, then The Hot Shop is hands down the place for an amazing experience!!!",

We did three classes and due to coast highway construction (go figure eh?) we were fifteen minutes late. With a quick phone call he was completely understanding about it and he had left plenty of time after our appt until his next one so we still got to do all three of our pieces. \\n\\nHe was very knowledgeable and his teaching techniques were very easy to follow and understand. He helped us newbies make some very beautiful glass pieces to take home with fond memories attached to them.",

Jeff talked to us first finding out what we wanted in shape, color and size. He listened to us about translucency and opaqueness. He really listened to what we each wanted to do. Jeff was the greatest teacher, walking us thru each step, explaining everything and telling us how good we were doing. He had his hand in the process enough so that there would be a good outcome. A fantastic souvenir, bowls we made ourselves!  We pick them up tomorrow morning. Glass blowing is an art and you can&apos;t predict the exact result but we did it ourselves!!",

He is also an amazing artist. You will not only learn the how to, but he will also drop some historical facts on you as you work. It was very interesting. He also lets you do about 98% of the work on your project, unlike other shops. But at any time, if you ask, he will step in if you are not feeling comfortable with any part. This shop is truley family owned and operated. And you can tell, both Jeff and his wife are very personable and they seemed to really care about their customers. Prices are just a bit lower than other shops in the area, which is nice. And he is much more flexible on the projects he offers. What you get for your money is a great time, an education and an outstanding project piece you made and will enjoy for years to come. If you are anywhere near Newport OR. And want to do some glass blowing, this is the place to go. We made 5 projects and everyone was very pleased how they came out.",

I came in on a Tuesday, the place was massive! I have never seen a restaurant so big. I wandered the many corridors for about fifteen minutes looking for where the food was actually served. Then a bearded, walkie-talkie bearing man stopped me, he appeared a little concerned. He asked me if I was someones grandmother. I was shocked! Yes, I am a grandmother, but how old do I really look? So rude! Then he wanted me to get a visitors badge, when I told him I was only here for the food. He got really nice, and brought me to this office-looking room. He made a call and I was taken out to a bus where they hauled me off to be &quot;evaluated&quot;. What an odd experience with horrible customer service. That&apos;s 2 out of 2 bad visits, Would not recommend.",

We have traveled the globe but we&apos;ve never had the opportunity quite like this one.  Few activities appeal to all three of my teenagers but designing and making their own custom glass blown art was a huge hit with everyone.  Today, we picked up the finished pieces and they are spectacular.  I am so grateful for the time and patience the shop owners/artisans took to teach my kids about their craft and integrate them meaningfully into each step of the process.  This shop is Native American owned and operated.  I will long cherish not only the glass art we carry home but the stories they told of how their Indigenous culture and customs are integrated into their amazing creations.  If you are anywhere near Newport, visit this shop.  It&apos;s worth calling ahead or visiting their website to book an appointment if you want to make something yourself.  You can also choose from some of the beautiful pieces for sale.  Even with three kids and two dogs in tow - we couldn&apos;t resist buying several items (in addition to our custom pieces) to take home as gifts and for display.",

This summer, we tried Oregon Coast Glassworks and it could not have been a better experience. We had an individual glass blower expert show each of us how to make two unique pieces of blown glass--I made a beautiful float that was the perfect gift for my grandmother this Christmas; and my sister made a super cool paperweight with a wave inside that sits on her drawer at home. \\n\\nOur glass blower, Steve, was so much fun to spend time with and helped our pieces turn out beautifully. We were even running a little bit late to our appointment, but they were so nice and understanding about it. Because our glass pieces take 24 hours to cool, Oregon Coast Glassworks was kind enough to mail them to us as soon as they were ready. What a treat!\\n\\nThere are a ton of glass blowing workshops along the Oregon Coast, but Oregon Coast Glassworks is definitely the one to go with. It will simply be a wonderful experience.",

Some friends had done it earlier in the day and we were able to walk right in, sign up, and learn how to make a float in 30 minutes! The teachers are great...very patient and encouraging, and the fact that we walk away with a piece of art (after letting it cool for a day in the shop) is so rad! Thank you for sharing your studio with the public!",

We got to the round-about, but there were these tall red street pylons where you are supposed to enter the parking lot.  \\n\\nGee...maybe they don&apos;t want any more visitors?  We went slowly around the round-about a few times looking like morons, and noticed just a few cars in the parking lot, so we decided to just go for it...and avoid the pylons.  Once in the parking lot I looked back and saw a few other cars pausing and wondering if they should enter, but were not sure because of these pylons.\\n\\nSo now...a reservation is required.  Welcome to post covid where every attraction insists you download an &quot;app&quot; and make a reservation.   But no worry says the front desk girl...&quot;just download the app, make a reservation, and....pay the $3 per person fee.&quot;   \\n\\nYes, the Hatfield Marine Science Center is no longer free.  \\n\\nI&apos;m not turned off by paying $3 per person, but having to download an app, and make a reservation when the building is almost empty at 4pm is ridiculous.  I&apos;m sure somewhere along the way HMSC gets my email address and profiling privileges through that app for future promotions and discounts?  And I con&apos;t care for the &quot;self-guided tour&quot; via the app.  Feel free to call me a grumpy Oregonian already paying way too high taxes.\\n\\nAs far as the actual exhibits, we didn&apos;t go.  Disney apps are bad enough, and now local attractions are doing the same, I guess in the name of crowd control?    \\n\\nI&apos;ll assume there still is an octopus in a big tank that you can fondle.  It&apos;s probably great for kids just like it was for the past 40 years.  Theres probably some new stuff too.",

There is a lot of really great displays with information to read but also some really fun interactive exhibits. We spent some time building tsunami resistant walls made of legos in a wave simulator. Once you build a wall you press a touch screen which simulates a wave. That&apos;s when you find out how sturdy your structure is! \\n\\nAnother neat exhibit is a sand box which you can shift sand around to create mounds and a light above sense the topographical change and changes the sand colors in relation to the elevation of the mounds. So you can shift sand around to create blue lakes and waterways, mountains of green and even build high enough for the sand to turn white. You have to try it to understand. \\n\\nThere are puzzles and questions for the kids as well as a touch pool. They have so many fish and sea creatures to look at in the aquariums as well. And a fun gift shop as well, of course. :)\\n\\nJust a really fun place that is great for families, dates, kids, or anyone who is interested in marine life!",

The touch tank was a good experience and the displays on oyster cultivation and wave-generated electrical generation were educational.  The walk along the estuary trail is a great opportunity to see birds (including the osprey nest on a pole at one end of the trail).  We were disappointed, however, that there were no exhibits regarding research into climate change and its impacts on marine life and environments (although the oyster cultivation exhibits did briefly discuss the challenges to oyster cultivation due to ocean acidification resulting the absorption of too much carbon).  Some of the exhibits felt a bit dated, too.  Still, a good place to visit and well-worth the time of you&apos;re looking for some place interesting to spend a couple of hours in Newport.",

I didn&apos;t realize this and I felt bad because I left all my personal belongs besides my phone at our beach rental. \\n\\nIf you have kids under the age of 6 skip the aquarium and come here instead- it is right down the street- and if at all possible  don&apos;t go anywhere near the abomination known as the &quot;Undersea Gardens&quot;. \\n\\nAside from missing the larger marine animals and birds the selection of fish is very comparable. They even have a small handling tank with star fish. Just realize it is a working marine research center so don&apos;t expect theme park mascots and concession stands- it is for looking and learning. The place is also bigger than I thought it would be. \\n\\nI highly recommend this place above the other similar attractions in town.",

Woo hoo!\\n\\nThe Hatfield Marine Research Center falls squarely under Type 2 for me. The fancy pants Newport Aquarium is just down the road, but admission for a family of four is roughly $75. It is a superior aquarium with more interactive exhibits, shows, etc., but that is a lot of money to spend on every trip to the area.\\n\\nI&apos;ve visited the Newport Aquarium before and will do so again, but I recommend alternating your visits with the Hatfield for a different set of activities. Your wallet will thank you. \\n\\nFor a free museum it is pretty darn cool. It starts with the eight-armed receptionist. I love the description of the octopus on their website, &quot;There have been many greeters, each with its own personality and level of enthusiasm for the job - and each with its own name, chosen by our visitors.&quot;  The tank is covered and flash photography is prohibited, but it is periodically opened during feeding time.\\n\\nMy boys&apos; other favorite things were the Tidepool touch tanks with the vibrant sea anemone and the movies in the small auditorium. As a parent, I absolutely love visiting places where I don&apos;t feel obligated to stay if the kids&apos; interest isn&apos;t there. So you can really make your visit as long or short as you please. \\n\\nThe center is located on the south side of the bridge just minutes away from the historic Bayfront district. The store is also filled with a great selection of books and other merchandise. If only more museums could be so cheap and easy.",

You can&apos;t get on it, but it is neat to see the research vessel the kids take to see for learning and exploration.  \\nThe Octopus is the star attraction, however i like to poke the sea enemies, hahaha.  \\nThere are many fish exhibits, some really up close views of the fish in various tanks.  We take almost two hours to see it all,  including a visit to the gift shop.  Sometimes pretty cool stuff.  They really lean towards the educational, so many items in the gift shop are great for the kids.  \\nWe did make a donation as we left, it was well worth it!  \\nTip-- it is really close to the rogue brewery so Lunch is very close!",

I was finally able to schedule it and take the class from Taylor herself this past March.   Not only did she teach me how to use the equipment I already owned more efficiently, but she opened my eyes to so much more as far as the type and style of photos I like to take.  Yes, this was a beginner&apos;s class, but now I have more of an overall understanding.  I had been doing so many wrong things for so long.\\n\\nShe is so down-to-earth and easy to talk to.  I loved the way she explained everything in layman&apos;s terms in addition to having a great guide book she provided.  She even offered help on choosing other equipment and gave me an example of what a photography release should look like.  \\n\\nMy only regret is that I didn&apos;t take the time to learn from her sooner.  I hope to take her full mentorship class soon to learn more about editing and business.  I would highly recommend taking a class from her as well as booking for photography needs.",

One problem with that is they don&apos;t make fresh food all day food is mostly reheat it is very occasional and conditional that you will get fresh food. Another problem with it is that they don&apos;t care about the students they care about getting him in and out they pass their own care if they feel they don&apos;t care it is just you you can have a few connections with a few teachers. Lastly I would like to point out that the environment doesn&apos;t feel very great the students there are the only fun part about it and the teachers there only a few teachers there then OK one positive note though is that those few teachers that are good it will make you your experience a little better there&apos;s one principle that is OK..",

            "description": "Riverdale High School is a great high school. Honestly, as far as Tennessee schools go, the environment is great and the staff genuinely care about the students. Riverdale is nothing like the city schools that are great mis-mash of conflicting cultures and ideals which results in most kids attending private schools. Most students who attend Riverdale have parents who has attended Riverdale which means generations of people love this school.\\n\\nThere are many other little things about Riverdale that make it unique. Although there is definitely a presence of drugs, it&apos;s never become remotely violent. Most people who do drugs here mostly do weed, which isn&apos;t too harmful. Riverdale does have a no-tolerance policy on smoking, drugs, and drinking, so if any student starts to over-do, another student is likely to report them. Most of our problems with stupid Freshmen who think they&apos;re smart. Earlier this year two freshman football players that are not so decent people started vaping every morning before getting on the bus. It got so smelly that they got reported. On another incident, a freshman girl (often tries to be cool by bringing drugs), brought wine in a clear water bottle then shared it. She confessed and got off easy, while the boy she shared it with got suspension because he tried to lie about it being kool-aid. Kids who do serious things get sent to local alternative school.\\n\\nEven with the drugs, Riverdale is very non-violent and very few people actually hate each other. Sure, gossip happens but it&apos;s mostly bark (no bite). Kids here seem to really enjoy talking to each other and the cliques aren&apos;t really that judgmental (excluding the racist hillbilly kids or the black kids, mostly girls, who act uppity). In fact, if you have some smarts, you can make a lot of fast friends in many different colors and interests. It&apos;s a very relaxed environment with very little drama.\\n\\nRiverdale has several focuses. Mr. Nolan, who runs the school, is super lenient with his students. He tries to give them the best and really cares about every kid. \\n\\nIf you&apos;re into machines and fixing uppin, Riverdale has a built in body shop to experiment on cars and other machinery. The ag department also offers a class on fixing farming equipment if you&apos;re into that. As far as electronics go, they also offer programming classes that make videos games and from my impression the students enjoy. During lunch the programming students can be found in the teacher&apos;s room watching videos or working on coding.\\n\\nA good main focus is the student moral and sports. Mr. Nolan loves his rallies in the Gym and recently had the Gym redone as a result. He mainly focuses on rallies for the main sports teams such as football and our famous girls&apos; basketball team that just won again this year. However unless students try to rise up and ask for less popular sports that we&apos;re also mega successful in to me recognized, sports like wrestling will be ignored. They are building another athletics building right now, and I don&apos;t exactly know what it is for. However, they already have a swimming pool, a gym, a track and football field, and among other things. \\n\\nThe ag department has two separate parts. Small animal has an in-building collection of animals, including guinea pigs, rabbits, a corn snake, ferrets, degus, rats, mice, an iguana, two bearded dragons, and chinchillas. They also have rabbits outside in hutches. Large animal charge has sheep, goats, and I believe also works with cows and horses from other places. The ag department hosts FFA which is great for anyone interested in farming, livestock, or just going out and doing stuff with animals. They volunteer with the local shelter.\\n\\nThe science depart is also notable. They have a very active science club that will take outings to the local Barfield-Cresent park and volunteer to pick up trash, test water, etc. They also have taken field trips to go caving or canoeing. Mr. Hurt and Ms. Hargrove are super friendly. Mr. Hurt is arguably my favourite teacher as if you are interested in science and want to learn more about genetics in particular species or have him review scientific papers, he will take extra time to do that.\\n\\nThe language department is eh. They offer Latin, Spanish, and German. The current German teacher is very lenient, sometimes too much. I&apos;m sure he&apos;s a great guy but he sometimes makes fun of his students when they&apos;re trying to learn. I&apos;ve heard eh things about the Spanish teacher as well.\\n\\nThe English department is arguably one of the best. All the English teachers really, really care about their students and their grades. Many of the teachers who get the students with the higher test scores refuse to teach the state tests and instead have us actually writing papers with little worksheets to help us find textual evidence.\\n\\nOverall, Riverdale is a great school with many upsides. It&apos;s an old school and looks run down, but the community makes it worth attending for fourth years. Recommended.",

This was a fun yet really educational session, and they managed to get the four and eight hour classes finished earlier than expected... which was a huge relief!  \\n\\nThe course was at the Holiday Inn Express on Chaffin Place in Murfreesboro,  (I give that place four and a half stars itself... not a full five as it didn&apos;t have a restaurant) and we could get coffee, avail ourselves of the food at the full breakfast bar... not a bad deal.  We played cool games in between the necessary videos, quizzes and tests, with a break about halfway through the four hour course, and a lunch hour for the eight hour... however, we managed to cover so much so quickly with retention that we were out of there hours earlier than expected. (We were a group of smart cookies!  Yay us!)\\n\\nI can seriously say I learned a lot today.  Things have changed since I took drivers ed.  Barrett and Kayla are a great team... he&apos;s the teacher, and she&apos;s the silent but efficient partner; I really got a kick out of her as I know she&apos;s as charismatic as he is!  We got tips on how to efficiently deal with our completion certificates, got the fax numbers AND the number to call to follow up to make sure the Department of Safety actually HAD received it... I don&apos;t trust a fax transmittal sheet myself.  I want to know an actual PERSON has gotten that fax from that machine and done what they were supposed to do with it.  This is my driver&apos;s license we are talking about here!  So, they made sure each person knew what to do in their particular situation.\\n\\nAll in all?  I had a great day with a group of great people... exceptional teachers... an A+ school in all regards.  If one must attend this sort of thing?  This is the one!  I got a discount for signing up and paying online as well!!!",

            "description": "I promised myself after I finished my master&apos;s degree that I would write a Yelp review about my school. This has been a long awaited review. I have been at MTSU since 2018. I completed my last year of my bachelor&apos;s, my master&apos;s, and in August - I start my doctorate. This school has been a saving grace for me as an adult learner. \\n\\nI can&apos;t say a single negative thing about my university. From the professors, the curriculum, to the overall student experience has been exceptional. For the education I am receiving, it is worth every penny. It&apos;s not an expensive education considering what I have learned and the village that has been behind me to thrive. \\n\\nIf there was a downside to the university, I&apos;d say parking services sucks and they are determined to collect your money. Watch out when you park and pay attention to ensure you park in the correct lot. If you don&apos;t - it is going to cost you extra money you don&apos;t want to unnecessarily spend. Speaking from recent experience, but I digress. I guess I have officially had my right of passage to receive a parking ticket.\\n\\nMTSU is great for remote learning and easy to understand for those who might not believe that online education is a good fit for them. MTSU caters to those working folks who may not be able to dedicate their entire life to schooling and have other obligations outside of their educational career. I am one of them minus the pandemic. \\n\\nI completed my entire master&apos;s online in 3 semesters due to being a full-time student. It was the best way for my to utilize my time during very a very unpredictable year. I do not regret my decision to get it out of the way. The pandemic shifted a lot in our lives and this was the best track for me to take to thrive. \\n\\nNow, with my doctorate on the horizon, I look forward to working full-time while attending part-time. Recognizing the busy schedule that I will have; I could not ask for a better school to walk with me through this educational journey that I am about to endure.",

            "description": "Only MTSU would promote people getting their undergrad, masters, and doctoral degree in the same place. Any university worth anything would disclose to students to go elsewhere upon finishing an undergrad. Because in the real world of academe, it is looked down upon for any single student to get all three degrees in the same place. It is one of those unwritten rules that no one at MTSU will volunteer. Otherwise, how would they make their money? That is all MT cares about--getting your money. MT will take your money and hustle you all the way.",

            "description": "My father, Charles Johnson, died in 2006. I have not been able to move on, and maybe part of it is because he left behind unfinished business - litigation with MTSU or Middle Tennessee State University, his last office job before my mother&apos;s death and this lawsuit sent him into spiraling depression that convinced him to work construction and day labor jobs instead.\\n\\nWhat happened to the student workers and construction workers who were exposed to asbestos all those years ago? I believe some of them may have developed or are beginning to develop symptoms related to asbestos exposure now, such as mesothelioma or lung cancer. My mother died from cancer in 1995 and I remember my father saying that he believed she might have been exposed to the asbestos that was in the building my family lived in in the early 1990s (Smith Hall).\\n\\nMy father was a whistleblower who blew the whistle on MTSU for exposing students to asbestos. He was a David who fought Goliath and lost. My mother died a few months before this article was written. How could my father tolerate a legal battle after losing his wife to cancer? I don&apos;t know. I want people to know what happened to him. He will not have died in vain because I am still alive to tell his story.",

They, the History department, did not want to give me credit for my previous work. My past classes were superior to what they offered--using the department heads words. Additional, while taking a 3d art elective. I was accused by the instructor of sexual harassment for a female student who was interested in me and I politely rebuffed (she was just unattractive). The student didn&apos;t initiate the complaint the instructor did. I had to insure an evasive process for 3 months to pure my innocence. The student in question testified on my behalf. The instructor was not given a contact renewal. Don&apos;t attend this school. It unprofessional. MTSU is a Boomer culture not an educational institution. The History profs knowledge was antiquated at best. MTSU is a waste of money, time and a 1 star rating.",

The Staff and Faculty were very accommodating and welcoming.  They worked hard to help me and made the transition simple.  The students didn&apos;t even blink an eye at the old guy.  Several even made it a point to befriend me (no, not to buy them beer) and that really made me feel welcome at the University.  As far as the education, well with all the new technology it was very easy for an old guy like me.  They provide all the resources and help you could possibly need.  The campus has been redesigned to accommodate the student, making them comfortable and providing them all the help they need.  If you dont understand, just ask and you will get the help.",

            "description": "This was a good starter University. It&apos;s a fun place to be a freshman, and have your first college experience. I got my undergraduate degree here in Biology. I still remember the smell of the biology building--I was grossed out at first but now that smell makes me kind of feel comfortable and warm, haha.\\n\\nAnyone who is considering this University and has visited will know, it&apos;s huge. There are about a million buildings and as one professor said, they&apos;re still &quot;Building the empire.&quot;\\n\\nOne of the things about MTSU that really sets it apart is a program that just recently began called MTeach. If you&apos;re in the market for your degree in teaching, this is the ONLY University in Tennessee that offers this, and I would recommend them very highly. If you want to be a teacher, DO NOT stay at home and go to community college for two years to save money! Start Mteach your freshman year and you will not regret it! It is the most hands on curriculum for teaching teachers. The lady who is presently in charge of it is Sally Millsap, whose contact information can be found on MTSU&apos;s website, and she is an absolute treasure. All of the staff at MTeach are there for you 100% and will give you the individual attention you would not expect from such a large school.\\n\\nThat said, advising here blows. You aren&apos;t going to get good advice from your advisor and you might as well sit down with a course catalog and work out your four year plan by yourself. Maybe have a professor in your department check it, but don&apos;t plan on getting a lot of help. Use your common sense!!!\\n\\nOne of my biggest regrets from my undergrad is not living on campus. MTSU has several dorms that are practically brand new and it&apos;s like a sleepover party every night. My friend lived in one of the dorms and her whole floor was full of girls who became close friends and I wish I&apos;d had that experience.\\n\\nAs far as dining goes, if you don&apos;t have the stomach for normal cafeteria stuff, don&apos;t buy a meal plan unless they force you to. If you do eat on campus, go to JUB. ALWAYS JUB. And try to go around 10:30. They&apos;re going to charge you for breakfast but you can stay until 11 when they start serving lunch. Grab waffles, cereal, and some pizza on the way out. And don&apos;t miss the MTSU chocolate milk. They make it on campus with the farming students and it is the best chocolate milk I have ever experienced.\\n\\nI give MTSU three stars because it&apos;s A-OK. That is exactly how I would describe it. You get what you need for an undergraduate degree. It isn&apos;t as high tech as some of the schools in California (except perhaps for the student health building) but it is the best price in the state for a degree. Live on campus for at least your first two years. Trust me. And then move out into your own place if you&apos;re ready. Murfreesboro is cheap. There are plenty of things wrong with this place, but if I had to go back and do it all over, I wouldn&apos;t change University&apos;s.",

If you go here you won&apos;t get a free ride, it&apos;s not easy and you will have to study to make it through to the end and get that diploma.  The professors here are first rate and some of the most laid back easy going people you&apos;ll meet, if you communicate with them you&apos;ll get a first rate education at mid range prices too.  \\n\\nThe area around here is kind of expensive but the school is not, you&apos;ll also find that it&apos;s a very safe campus and somewhere you can walk freely being yourself without being ridiculed or judged by others.  That being said this is one of the best schools in the Southeast in my opinion.  I&apos;ve visited friends at other schools and believe me, they are not in such great neighborhoods and you will be surprised at the cost difference and the disappoint my friends feel after visiting MTSU.  \\n\\nI am proud to have gone here and I&apos;m also glad it wasn&apos;t a cakewalk, you earn your degree here and it makes you a better person in the process.",

There&apos;s always construction on campus, it&apos;s inevitable.\\n\\nI&apos;m a sophomore at MT but I won&apos;t be graduating from there due to the fact they do not have my major. Advisors/ staff experience all depends on your major and how much you bug them about your issues. Bigger departments, such as financial aid and admissions, have always been accessible and helpful during my time as a student.\\n\\nI&apos;m usually always on the older side of campus so I don&apos;t often get to see the buildings/ construction my tuition dollars has helped fund. The student union building is very nice and there are a lot of food options located within, as well as across campus. My biggest complaint is the fact that MTSU puts so much money into the newer parts of the campus while older buildings get worse by the year. I practically live in the KOM (oldest building on campus) during the semester and it&apos;s falling apart slowly but surely. The AC is either freezing you out of the class or not working at all. The windows rattle during any kind of wind event and lady bugs invade when the weather changes.\\n\\nOverall, I like MTSU. While I wish they offered my major so I didn&apos;t have to move to an entire different state, we can&apos;t all have what we want. I will continue to finish my\\ngeneral credits here until the inevitable move. I hope that with the addition of the new parking garages and construction all around campus, it will continue to be pretty easy to navigate and accommodating to those students enrolling each semester.",

For me, the fact that they are a full Spanish immersion program is just an added bonus ;)\\n\\nI enrolled my son when he was 14 months old. His social and verbal skills have blossomed in these first few months. He adores his teachers, Maestra Ofelia and Maestra Rosy. Every morning when I drop him off, Ofelia greets him with her warming smile and embrace. No tears here! I am also updated throughout the day via an app that lets me know what he&apos;s doing that day. \\n\\nThe school coordinator, Andrea has been wonderful communicating back and forth with me from the moment I met her. I&apos;ve had a lot of questions and requests and she&apos;s always been so accommodating! She greets every parent and child by name-which again, reiterates my point of every single person there cares! \\n\\nOverall, my son and I are very happy being a Miró family. We look forward to many happy pre-k years together!",

The school came highly recommended, from multiple Independent sources, for the curriculum,  knowledge and dedication of the staff and owner. But what impresses is the most about Miró is the warmth of the staff and the feeling that our 3 year old joined a small community and an environment that feels like family, to help support him. We have had the opportunity to meet such a diverse group of families and love that our son is exposed to all of this at such a young age. I would highly recommend miro to anyone looking for a well rounded education and a nurturing environment for their young children .",

They have a clear curriculum from Spain that they follow, but I am most impressed with their focus on helping to raise polite, caring, and loving children.\\n\\nOur daughter was over her apprehension within a week and now she can&apos;t wait to go play with all of her friends. She is constantly teaching us new songs in Spanish and her language skills have really blossomed (we speak a mixture of English and Spanish at home, but we are not native speakers).\\n\\nWe like the use of the BrightWheel app which keeps us up to date about our daughter&apos;s day (and there is at least one new photo of her sent to us daily).\\n\\nWe did look at a few other schools but this one best fit our personality.

Míro offered that environment to me...and much more.\\n\\nFabiana has created a trusting environment with an amazing curriculum and an equally amazing staff to deliver it.  \\n\\nFrom the moment I walked into Míro I felt at home.  Talk about accommodating....My daughter was much younger than the other babies, and as a result, at a much different level.  (Not walking, feeding self etc.) the school insisted that I bring her and they would work with me.  One of the teachers actually brought in her college aged daughter to personally care for my daughter so that she could stay at the school.\\n\\nAlso, the school was closing for a week of summer break but I really needed care, so one of the teachers offered to watch all 3 of my girls! \\n\\nAmazing! Let me tell you, this stuff just doesn&apos;t happen at other places! \\n\\nI received regular texts and pictures that let me know how/what the girls were doing.  What a spectacular group of professionals.\\n\\nOh and did I mention that the tuition is extremely reasonable?! I used to pay a ridiculous amount of money for a Spanish Immersion school right down the street.\\n\\nSo, if you have been praying for a place that you feel relaxed leaving your child...one that wouldn&apos;t leave you thinking about your kids and their well being......              all. day. long..........\\n\\nLOOK NO FURTHER!

            "description": "If you are looking for a SCHOOL and not a daycare that offers a structured curriculum every single day for your little one, look no further than this school, MIRO. We actually stumbled across the school on yelp because we were in search for structured Socialization.  After learning more about what Spanish immersion was and touring the school, we were sold on sending our 2 year old there to get a jumpstart on learning another language, especially because we are in English only speaking household. Our son began attending Miro at 15 months and has been there for less thank one year. He has learned so much Spanish! I&apos;ve noticed him saying things to me in Spanish that bring me back to when I was in high school and learned a little bit of the language. For example, he opens the fridge and says &quot;papas!&quot; (Potatoes) and points to so many things and will say &quot;aqui!&quot; (Here). He can easily count to 10 in spanish, knows all his facial features in Spanish, and can sing many rhymes and songs in Spanish not to mention easily over 100 words (well probably more, but i need to brush up on my Spanish!!).  The teachers are wonderful. His teacher last year, maestro Betty is phenomenal.  She loves every student as one of her own kids and really cares about their well being and education.  Because my son was so young when he started, and began going to school full time from the start (7:30-3 Monday-Friday) it was a little bit of an adjustment. Betty did not even bat an eye when my son would cry for the first little while every morning i would drop him off. Now he doesn&apos;t want to leave school when we go to pick him up! The school is like a family and i would recommend this school to anyone looking for something more than &quot;daycare&quot;. If you&apos;re looking for a diaper changing babysitter, MIRO IS NOT for you. But if you are wanting the absolute best care, curriculum, structure, education, clean facility, MIRO IS THE PLACE! Go for a tour and meet Fabiana, the owner. I promise you won&apos;t regret it. And just because it&apos;s a Spanish immersion, doesnt mean it will empty your wallet. You get so much by sending your child to this school, at an extremely reasonable price. You need to go check it out.  It&apos;s seriously amazing and I&apos;m so happy to have stumbled across this school for my little one. I know this will be life changing for my son ;) thank you miro!!",

As a former Elementary School Teacher I chose Spanish Immersion because I know of the benefits to expand and enhance brain development. We do not speak Spanish at home, so it is wonderful to see our children realize our dreams. The teachers are loving and they strive to offer a rich curriculum. Now they have the chance with the SIRABUN educational model. If you want a preschool that will have your child exit with a strong working knowledge of Spanish, and also be loved and nurtured, this school will meet your expectations.",

My son was in a daycare for 4 painful days before we started at Miro, and thankfully we were able to quickly get him out of daycare and into this preschool! Our daycare experience was AWFUL, and making the switch to Miro made such a HUGE difference in his life! This is a preschool, not a daycare, with designated teachers and a structured curriculum. It is very obvious that the teachers and all of the staff truly care about the children. They maintain open communication, post pictures and updates in the app daily, and actively engage the children in various activities. My son is SO much happier attending Miro, and I love that he gets to participate in various learning activities daily while learning Spanish on top of it! They also host several events for the children, and often involve the parents, which is amazing. At Miro, you feel like part of a family! I would highly recommend Miro. :)",

They truly love their jobs and you can feel it.  It&apos;s a very safe and loving environment. I would recommend this school to anyone looking to have their child in a immersion program that goes over and beyond any preschool!",

My husband and myself have looked at different options, since we have 2 preschool aged boys. We had enrolled our child in another &quot;Spanish Enrichment Preschool&quot; where we were not seeing him grow as he has now that he is in Miro Preschool with Maestra Maria. Our 18 month old loves Maestra Evelyn he has started producing words in Spanish which is exciting. We are thankful for all the work and effort that Fabiana has put into this preschool. It is a loving, caring, and educational environment. We love the teachers and are thankful to be in the Miro family.",

The immersion Spanish approach has given them a wide exposure to Spanish language and many aspects of Spanish speaking cultures from many countries. Our older girl, halfway through her 3rd year of immersion asked that we only speak Spanish at home. We were sad and delighted that she had already surpassed our limited Spanish language abilities.  These teachers show a passion for education and love for our girls that makes us comfortable entrusting them with the hearts and minds of our little ones.",

            "description": "I recently enrolled my 1 year old son at Miro, after pulling him out of a large corporate daycare chain. I was very disillusioned with the childcare system after witnessing the lack of care and love offered by these large multi-state facilities. Enter Miro, I found Miro by searching for a boutique style preschool. I quickly called for an appointment and met with the dynamic and fantastic owner, Fabiana. I was also introduced to Evelyn who would become my sons teacher. I use the word teacher because she teaches my son but teacher does not describe the level of love this wonderful woman shows my son every day. I recently dropped off my little guy who had a rough morning, slept in- little breakfast before we were on our way. Needless to say he was grouchy, but Evelyn embraced him whispering affectionate words in Spanish to him while she cradled him. I left but snuck around back to see this wonderful women holding my son in the playground and having him play and relax. I can&apos;t begin to tell you how relived I am to find Miro. My son is thriving in this wonderful environment full of love and laughter. Bravo, Fabiana for bringing this beautiful facility to us and for taking such care in the hiring of your staff.",

Everything abstract stated in my review of the college as a whole (listed on the Bentonville campus review) extends quite completely to this location. \\n\\nAs for the concrete, this is a building of several classrooms, where a student living nearby can pick up quite a few credits conveniently. If needing to get to Bentonville, there is a regular bus that goes campus to campus.

I had no worries dropping my little one off everyday knowing she was loved and cared for and watched over by a well trained staff.  The time we were there the teachers were consistent and I did not see much turnover, just some teachers changing classrooms.  I&apos;ve never felt so strong about a daycare until my little one just started going to a more expensive/fancier one closer to where we live now and they are nothing like BrightHaven.  BrightHaven seemed to have about a 3:1 or 4:1 ratio with the infants which was great and we were blessed.  The new place we have to take her temporarily does the 6:1 ratio and they can&apos;t keep up with all the infants.  It&apos;s sad.  We miss BrightHaven and I would highly recommend them to anyone!  They also remember your names and treat you like family, not just another number.",

I signed up for a B2 Deutschkurs because my other school (AGI) was full. During the sign up process they told me that I would have to take a placement test. So I asked the secretary if I would get my money back if I didn&apos;t pass the test (or if I wasn&apos;t issued my visa), and she said yes of course. So I sent them the 730\u20ac in good faith and got my visa extended. A few weeks later I took the test, and leaving I felt very confident that I had done well. We would see the results on that Friday.\\nSo my friend who had also taken the test with them goes before me on Friday. He texts me that he had not enough points and they told him that they WOULD NOT be able to give him his money back and he would have to retake B1 with them! They told him that if he wanted to take B2 he could maybe attend the first 3 or 4 days of class and if he was able to keep up they would allow him to continue. These were his only options!\\nSo I was very concerned that they would tell me something similar. I was preparing to demand my money back because I had just finished taking B1 and did very well in the class at AGI. So I rushed over there and asked for my scores. They told me that I also had not scored enough and that I had to retake B1 with them. I asked if I could do the same as my friend and try to attend the first few days and see from there. They told me no! I said they offered it to my friend and they told me his score was probably better than mine but for me it was not possible. Later I found out we had the SAME EXACT SCORE. I said there was no way I am going to retake B1 because I just spent two months doing B1 and how am I supposed to afford this?! These courses are not cheap! After a while of talking to the secretary they agreed to give me some of my money back, but they will charge a 50\u20ac fee! Remember, earlier I had asked specifically if I would be able to get my money back and they said that would be no problem! No one mentioned I would have to argue with them for my money or anything about a fee!\\nI told my friend that I got my money back and so he was very pissed that they didn&apos;t do the same for him. He went back and got his, but he was also charged this 50\u20ac. We both signed up for classes at AGI and there was no arbitrarily graded test and none of this drama! They also let us go to the course even though we couldn&apos;t pay until IFA finally sent the money back! Very nice of AGI!\\nLong story short, they gave us each completely different information on two counts - firstly that I could get my money back and he couldn&apos;t, and secondly that he could try out the first few days and I couldn&apos;t, despite having the same scores. I don&apos;t know what this is about! If we hadn&apos;t been friends and been able to compare our experiences, we would both have been screwed! I don&apos;t know why they are telling people different info, deceiving me by saying there would be no problems getting the money back. All I can say is they want to force some to retake a lower level with them so you end up studying with them longer and they make more money! Not cool!\\nIf anyone is looking for a great language school without any of this drama, I can highly recommend AGI (Anglo German Institute). They are great, friendly, and flexible! They really saved me by making a place for me in B2 after I got screwed over.",

Nothing special. an intensive course is about 20 hours a week, any school should be able to teach something in that amount of time.",

Instead they made a 7!year old feel really demoralized. We left the school and moved back home while my husband is left to finish his contract there. Not to say too much this alone impacted our relationship in worse ways than I though. Yea ISS not a great place if your kid is too active or too outspoken.",

            "description": "Our daughter has been an ISS student for two years now, with one year in the PYP (Primary Years Program, both at their Sindelfingen and Degerloch campus) and the other in the MYP (Middle Years Program, Degerloch campus).  \\n\\nFor a U.S. government contractor, ISS seemed like a slightly more affordable alternative to DoDDS (Department of Defense Dependence Schools), which costs $24,396 per year vice $17K to $18K per year at ISS; and, unlike at DoDDS, we have never had to worry about our daughter being &quot;bumped out of school&quot; due to over capacity (i.e., space at DoDDS is only guaranteed for children of military and government civilians).  \\n\\nThe IB (International Baccalaureate) program also sounded more admirable in its goal to mold and produce caring, compassionate, global-minded citizens, who are adept at self-motivation and self-education - a goal that greatly resonated with my husband and I.  Unfortunately, this discovery method only works when a student is already very self-driven and/or has access to very thoughtful, innovative teachers; ISS is bereft of the latter, which is why ISS students easily struggle in math and language learning.  For instance, rather than develop individualized learning plans to help students tackle their math and/or language challenges, ISS teachers will instead steer parents towards private tutoring services.\\n\\nPros of ISS: Although ISS&apos;s community of active parents is small, it is still impressively effective and most likely the reason why ISS continues to remain operational; it has some very caring and kind teachers and staff members, who truly care about the kids; it offers students a unique opportunity to become bilingual and/or trilingual, both through class learning and through immersion trips into neighboring towns; it provides numerous after school programs and a number of overnight school trips to &quot;facilitate holistic learning&quot;; and ISS works hard to build a community of compassionate, tolerant, and open-minded citizens by teaching their students how to appreciate, communicate, and interact with people from different cultures and from other countries.\\n\\nCons of ISS: ISS lacks visionaries; it is more reactive than proactive in its strategic and financial planning; many of its managing staff and teachers fail to understand the importance of providing students with strong foundational preparation, especially when it comes to math; lack of a focus on laying foundational knowledge has resulted in many kids falling behind and/or repeating a grade level, once they return to their home countries (most prevalent concern among non-German parents); the principals and teachers are slow at best to respond to your inquiries, unless forced to do so; and there is an absence of accountability for students, which, to be fair, is first and foremost up to the parents to address - but that doesn&apos;t mean that ISS should continue to set expectations without consequences, as well.\\n\\nMy husband and I still believe the IB program has great potential and merit, but we do not feel that ISS (Degerloch or Sindelfingen) has done all that it can to effectively execute it.",

John Brown chooses professors who desire to teach in a way that will prepare their students to use their gifts to glorify God. They&apos;ve got the best art program I&apos;ve ever experienced, and everyone on campus is aware of how important each major is to serve in Gods kingdom and better the world. \\nHowever, if you are a person who wants to party in college, John Brown is not for you. John Brown only requires you to not participate in things like drinking, gambling, premarital sex, or anything that might lead you to participate in those things for the time that you are enrolled at John Brown. \\nI&apos;ve never seen a college like this. Everyone I&apos;ve talked to who has experienced public colleges says that they are relieved and refreshed by the JBU environment. It&apos;s very hard to find a place like this in the US.

The financial aid is top notch. It is a Christian school without the guilt but they do hold the students to a high moral standard. The oldest dorms are under refurbishment right now. The others are standard, basic dorm rooms with everything you need but not fancy. There are some town houses and apartments on campus for upper classmen and many rent apartments off campus.

Like Rebecca said, it&apos;s got it&apos;s faults, but it&apos;s got it&apos;s ups as well.\\n\\nIt&apos;s a Christian university, and that can be felt pretty much everywhere on the campus. They&apos;re starting to be more open to homosexuals attending the school, but still things like smoking cigarettes/drinking (even if you&apos;re of age) will get you into huge trouble. The thing is they have you sign a community covenant at the beginning of each school year, so you&apos;re agreeing to the rules. I&apos;ve been told that if you don&apos;t want to abide by the rules, then you don&apos;t really need to be attending school here. Makes sense to me.\\n\\nWhile it has it&apos;s downs the ups far outweigh it. I actually like that they don&apos;t allow drinking/parties in the dorms. Don&apos;t get me wrong, we still have plenty of laughs and good times, but we also get our work done. If there was alcohol flowing at all times I&apos;m pretty sure there would be a lot less studying going on. \\n\\nOverall a great school, and I would recommend it if you&apos;re looking for a solid education and don&apos;t mind not having a party within spitting distance every night.\\n\\nMessage me if you want more info.",

When you are at the school you can see a level of kindness and respect amongst the students that is really refreshing to experience. \\n\\nHere&apos;s my best example of the amazing attitude of the kids at St. Francis: I booked my 3rd grade son&apos;s birthday party for the same day as the 2 nd grade First Communion. The 3rd grade boys including my son all agreed to &quot;have the party fast&quot;, because they wanted to be able to support their 2nd grade prayer buddies at the First Communion. The boys came to this on their own without parents involvement!\\n\\nThe teachers have kept me informed about my children&apos;s progress over the years. They have been encouraging to the kids.  Early intervention in struggling areas has led to my son earning top scores in class work and test scores.\\n\\nMy husband and I have made lasting friendships. There are opportunities to be involved and I feel my opinion counts in the community.",

You may think that only overachieving moms have their kids do Kumon, and yes, perhaps many do, but so do the moms (like me) who want their children to be able to whiz through their school homework and feel confident about learning in general. The 20 minutes per day of math or reading exercises takes discipline and is a little bit of an investment, but it is a very worthwhile one if you want to set your child on a course of learning that isn&apos;t dependent on flashy digital images for short attention spans. My 6 year old son is the envy of his class as he often helps fellow classmates with their writing and math homework, and he&apos;s just a kindergartner! My 16 year old daughter has really benefitted from the Kumon Algebra work she did prior to taking on Algebra at high school, and now she is preparing for her future Calculus classes as a Junior.\\nThis particular Kumon Center is outstanding (having attended others); they really invest in a well trained staff and so there is a very generous staff to student ration there at all times to assure your child that they will get the help they need. I&apos;m also grateful that they are located at Progress Ridge so that I can shop nearby and don&apos;t have to struggle for parking.",

During COVID they followed all protocols and i felt that it was not just done to follow policies, but out of genuine care of staff and families.\\nOur son initially joined Ms Kashmala&apos;s class. We have been receiving Early Intervention services due to delayed speech and walking and were very open about our needs. While we couldnt visit daycare inside at that time during COVID, Ms Kashmala set up a call with us to discuss how she can support our son&apos;s development. She asked a lot of questions and it just made me feel at ease. It is clear that she really cares about kids in her class. Thank you!\\nOur son later transitioned to Ms Michelle&apos;s class and ~around the same time parents were able to visit the daycare inside. Ms Michelle is just an amazing teacher and so very caring. Always positive, upbeat and absolutely fantastic with kids. I appreciate how caring and attentive she is.\\nAll other teachers that are employed there are amazing. We had so many other teachers helping out occasionally or primarily in the afternoons and we were very pleased with them.\\nWhen it comes to the director and assistant director - they are rock stars. They had to manage through COVID, changes in state&apos;s response to it, weather and they handled it so well. We appreciate everything you do.\\nI highly recommend Cadence to any parent that is looking for a center for their kids.",

This is saying alot since he cried almost every day last year going to a difference preschool. Now he often says he wants to go to Cadence on the weekend because he likes it so much! We could not be happier. Everyone from the Director to the teachers are so welcoming and responsive to any and all needs. The education in my opinion is great! He is learning upper and lower case letters, numbers including addition and counting by 2s, 5s and 10s and he can write his name and knows the days of the week and months of the year. He is well prepared for Kindergarten next year because of Cadence.",

But, the staff at Cadence has made it nothing but like home for him. He actually looks forward to school each day and they are getting him back on track for Kindergarten (as he was falling behind at his previous daycare). \\nThey also have amazing communication and are always looking for fun things to do at their center so the kiddo&apos;s can look forward to activities/dress up days/parties -etc. \\nI am so happy we made this transition and just want to thank the Cadence staff for being so awesome!!",

We&apos;ve been thru all the classrooms from infant to school-age and have had the opportunity to meet so many wonderful teachers. The teachers truly care about the kids. My children absolutely adore the staff and often times visit with and give hugs to their former teachers.  \\n\\nThe curriculum at Phoenix Children&apos;s Academy is top-notch! They really do a fantastic job of preparing the kids for grade school.  In Pre-K they learn how to write their names, write and recognize upper/lower case letters, letter phonics, and number recognition, among other things. In the latter half of Pre-K they start something called &quot;Kindergarten Club&quot; to help with the transition. \\n\\nI could go on and on about how much I appreciate everything this school has done for our kids.

We specifically picked them for this since it was a requirement for the military subsidy I was eligible for. They did not inform any parents that it lapsed and kept the NAEYC accredit on their website until we discovered it several months later(Feb 2019). We had to jump through hoops to get them approved since they had lost their accreditation. We finally did and received back pay for the 6 months we had paid in full. Unfortunately before we could use up all the back pay we had to move again to a different state. There was a balance of $527 left in my account. The school has refused to pay me the money left in my account. Their services have been paid in full 100%. We left in June and have been trying to get our money back since then. It is now October and they will not even answer my calls or emails. If you need to count on the management for anything don&apos;t hold your breath.\\n\\nUpdate: They did eventually refund my money in Nov (5 months later) after I continued to call/email and leave messages. Thankfully the local director cared enough to resolve this for me.",

The girl that I had doing my hair it was very sweet and wonderful. And I don&apos;t blame her for anything that happened because she was new to the floor And I know their students and they make mistakes. However Nancy should have been watching her and what she was doing. I&apos;m going back to what I said I&apos;ve been going there for years. And I have never not seen an instructor check up on the student. In the past I have always scheduled with very experienced students and the instructor has always checked on them once or twice throughout the process even with them being experienced students. And in my last visit not once did they come up and check on what she was doing to my hair. They decided that they were going to just chitchat the whole entire time and not check up on her while she fried my hair. I had shown them a picture of highlights and the coloring I wanted  and I currently had highlights in my hair when I showed up to the appointment. I told her when I was getting my highlights done that I wanted them closer to the scalp. She said that she could do that and I had spoken to Nancy When the student got the OK to proceed with my appointment. I am so beyond mad that it took me three months to write this review. The pictures I posted a before and after photo",

            "description": "I wasn&apos;t going to write this review on this platform but the salon academy has taken their reviews down off their Facebook page because of so many negative reviews coming in, but I feel obligated to share my experience with everyone so no one else has to experience this school as a client or student. I started going to the Salon Academy back in June 2020, the reason why is because one of my close friends was a student there and I was helping her get her services. Everything started out okay, until the director of the school Nancy Ferguson decided she had a problem with the student I was seeing. From this point forward everything became a horrible experience, not only for me as the client but also for this student as well. Here are some prime examples, in beauty school you have to provide models to test out on modules that you learn in school. I was going to be a make up model, for the student I arrived on time for my appointment and was the first one there out of the models, I proceeded to wait 20 minutes for the school to be ready to perform the test out on this module, this is when the instructor decided that there was no longer enough room for her whole class to test out and that she was going to exclude this student and me from this experience. I was then asked to leave in front of a whole waiting room and several students With no explanation as of to why or an apology for wasting my time. My friend messaged me letting know how distressed the situation made her and that she was coming home, before realizing Nancy took her purse and personal possessions, locked them in her office, then forced the distressed student to participate, starting 15 plus minutes late working on a random student, and then the instructor was irritated towards her the whole time. Definitely not a safe learning environment. \\n\\nThe next situation that baffled me, was when I was in the MIDDLE of receiving a facial when Nancy walks in again and instructed the student to walk out into the hall with her?? They then came back she informed me my service was over because the student needed to take a lunch.. I still paid for this service. I also later learned that the light therapy service I was paying extra for was not being counted for this student because Nancy had decided they had not yet properly taught the students how to be using this device.. (the student normally receives an extra point for this service as it is an add on.) So even though I was charged for this service, the student was not to receive any credit. This seems very unprofessional and questionable to me as a client. \\n\\nLastly, the receptionist Amelia Michaelson was SO unprofessional talking with clients and students about how unorganized she thought Nancy was and much more about how she couldn&apos;t stand working for her, etc. She also would talk about very inappropriate things such as paraphernalia with students and so on.. \\n\\nI could share much more on this situation but I will leave it at this. This school does NOT host a positive or supportive environment for their students or clients, and I would never and never will be going back to support this school as long as Nancy Ferguson is apart of this business. \\n\\nSincerely, \\n\\nA concerned Wilsonville community member.",

            "description": "Marley Martinez did a wonderful job on my hair and she was so great to work with. After such a good experience with her I decided to get a manicure there since it is right next to my office. \\n\\nFirst experience: I don&apos;t remember the gals name but she was very quiet -I was happy with the outcome of my nails. I did however notice that the salon was almost out of all nail color selections and top coats, I figured since it was the end of the month they may just be running out of inventory. \\n\\nSecond Experience: I came back, worked with a different gal- once again very quiet and didn&apos;t say more than two sentences to me. Once again, they were out of almost all nail color selections and the technician had to use the barrel of the bottom to even finish my nails. Afterwards, the  lady working at the front of the salon (colored hair, taller) asked me how my experience was and I replied &quot;It was okay, I did notice that your technicians are lacking a lot of supplies though.&quot; Her response was &quot;That is unfortunate.&quot;\\n\\nSome basis observations after my few times here: \\n- Management rarely checks on the nail technician&apos;s work during or after to critique \\n- Management is not very professional or friendly at the front of the salon and does not seem to care much for customer&apos;s satisfaction of service. \\n- Management does not conduct proper inventory audits to ensure students have the required materials to perform their job correctly \\n- Did I already mention management is very unprofessional? \\n- Management or front desk help running the show here lack professional and appropriate communication skills to ensure clients are satisfied - even if it is a beauty school! Also, do they even teach the students how to interact with clients? This is a great opportunity for them to network and earn lifelong clientele! \\n\\nIf you&apos;re looking for a cheap manicure, by all means try it out. Be prepared to have a three option color selection and be on your own if your nail technician messes up. If you&apos;re looking for a great hair stylist, ask for Marley Martinez - she is amazing.",

            "description": "I first went to The Salon Professional Academy a few months ago, and was excited that Wilsonville now has a school.  The first time I went was great, and while it took a long time for a haircut (I was there 2 hours), I&apos;m in my seventies and had the time.  I was very pleased with the service and went back 2 or 3 times!  Then, I was leaving on a trip and went back for a haircut a couple of days before I left.  Terrible haircut, but went back the next day for a mani-pedi. I should&apos;ve known better!  I always tell manicurists that I&apos;m diabetic.  I was there from 12:00 until 4:00 PM!  First, a manicure which was unlike anything I&apos;ve ever had! I went on to the pedicure (done by the same student).  Unlike any pedicure I&apos;ve ever experienced.  The instructor came over and gave her instructions periodically, then disappeared and she proceeded to completely disregard what she had been told.  I ended up with four coats of polish on my toenails (none of them dry before the next was applied, and it kept bleeding into the cuticles.  I finally had her remove all of it and I left.  By this time I was shaking.  Four hours, and I had missed lunch.  I was not offered so much as a drink of water!  When I got to the front, I was told that I owed for a basic mani-pedi, instead of the &quot;deluxe&quot;.  I told them to look my feet, and asked if that looked like a pedicure!  The response was &quot;I&apos;m sorry you weren&apos;t satisfied with the service&quot;!  I paid them (which I shouldn&apos;t have done), left and will never go back.  I don&apos;t blame the student.  The instructors and administration did her as much a disservice as they did to me!  They should be &quot;teaching&quot; their students who have paid for the school!  They also should be taught how to treat their clients, as well as techniques and skills.  I don&apos;t usually do things like this review; but I really feel that I need to in this instance.  Hopefully someone at the Academy will read this, and pay attention.",

The count above reflects the number of days during the school year that the primary schools in my district are closed vs. the number of days my company recognizes as holidays. Notice a little discrepancy?\\n\\nWell, mother&apos;s little helper isn&apos;t a glass of chardonnay. For some of those days, it is CREST to the rescue.\\n\\nA public school education in West Linn - Wilsonville is quite good. But, even in the best of times, exposing your kids to new concepts with a focus on nature, science, inquiry and exploration is never a bad thing. And guess what? These full day programs are scheduled to coincide with days the public schools are closed. \\n\\nCREST works in conjunction with the WLWV school district and they operate a research facility and farm in Wilsonville. CREST isn&apos;t open on a daily basis to the public, but you can call them to schedule a tour. They also have an open house every fall [1] and special events throughout the year. They&apos;ve even partnered with Audubon in the past for wildlife releases.\\n\\nMy children have benefited from CREST programs for years. A few of their &apos;Learning on the Go&apos; programs take place at the CREST facility, but more often than not, they are field trips. Amazing trips to parks, wetlands, creeks and farms. The programs are grade level specific, so on the same day they may offer two programs. One for grades 1 - 3 and another for grades 2 - 5. This isn&apos;t a cheap option ($35 - 40/day), but I consider it money well spent.\\n\\nThe highlight for my oldest son last year was their week long spring break trip to the Oregon Coast. My son had an absolute blast and they perfectly balanced education and fun. \\n\\nAnother reason why this is the best of the best in my area is that the district created a Farm-to-School program, managed by CREST, so they have a 10-acre plot to raise fresh produce for our district&apos;s food program. \\n\\nI can&apos;t say enough good things about the staff. Both on the administrative and the educational side. A public school education can be a mixed bag, but CREST earns full marks. They are totally on the honor roll.\\n\\n[1] Open House is September 18, 2010 from 10am - 2 pm",

Everyone there is very patient and accommodating.  The program is INTENSE to say the least.  It is focused on safety and a very rigorous program that even included us as parents committing to doing the &quot;homework&quot; after each session.\\nHomework was in the form of driving.  They ask for 100 hours outside of the program.  The DMV requires only 30 total!\\nIt took us over a year, but last week our son passed his driver&apos;s license test administered by Driving MBA.  It was almost 2 hours!  \\nAgain...DMV driving tests are 30 minutes at best.\\nWhile it will still be a while before he is ready to hit the road alone, we know that he has received the best training we could ask for.\\nHis instructors, Navar and Dawn were amazing and the owner Maria really takes pride and is involved to ensure that only the strictest guidelines are followed.\\nYes...It is a bit expensive and very involved, but the cost of knowing that we have prepared him as best as we can for this experience is nothing in comparison to receiving a random phone call from a police officer or even worse hospital with not so great news\\nWe are happy and blessed to have found Driving MBA.  You will be too.",

            "description": "So let me start by saying my husband, Justin, wrote a review tonight. I am writing a review to provide more perspective to Maria, who apparently needs a healthy dose of it. \\nMaria-this is aimed specifically to you. There is not a business in America that doesn&apos;t pay for their employees time when cancellations occur. Not. A. One. The fact that you think you are somehow unique in this regard is mind boggling to me. Where do I start? Doctor? Dentist? Chiropractor? Physical therapy? Staff for all these? And I read the other poor reviews. I love how you&apos;ve tried to mitigate these cancellations with doctors notes but it was too much to handle. Really? You have a staffing problem over there? You couldn&apos;t be further outside the bounds of reasonable. Like on another planet. What  you really want is for ALL your sick customers to show up-infection be damned. Covid has made EVERY BUSINESS make allowances. It is different-this isn&apos;t strept throat. I would STRONGLY ADVISE you to make sure you VERBALLY tell everyone that signs up the covid rule. I assure you that you will get push back -or just have folks show up sick-and that my dear, is on you. For not being reasonable DURING A PANDEMIC. Honestly, you should be ashamed of yourself.",

I called Driving MBA this PM as my son was in contact with a friend whose dad was diagnosed with C-19 today.  \\nI called Driving MBA out of an abundance of caution, and respect.  To be clear, my son was not in direct contact with the individual whom was diagnosed with C-19, but was in contact with his friend whom has not been diagnosed with C-19.  My son feels fine and will only be tested for Covid in the event that his health circumstances change; OR, if his friend was to have a change of circumstances.\\nRegardless, per Driving MBA policy, my son now cannot come in for his appt. tonight per their policy and Driving MBA are going to charge me an additional $50 (above and beyond the ~$1,350 that I have already invested) for the inconvenience, I.e. a cancellation fee.  Further, they offered to sell me some cancellation insurance.  Are you kidding me!\\nThis is certainly a unique time and if Driving MBA want to punish me for being responsible.  As a result, I CANNOT RECOMMEND DRIVING MBA IN ANY CAPACITY.",

            "description": "**BUYER BEWARE** It&apos;s very difficult to write this review, because I&apos;m personally not a fan of Yelp. I have found that many use it as a tool to retaliate against a business, especially without first contacting the business directly and giving them an opportunity to address the concerns. That being said, I did contact the business first, but failed to find any common ground with the owner. Here is my story: \\n\\nI was researching Driving Schools for my 15 1/2 year old. There are many and when I came across Driving MBA I did check their reviews. They were mixed, and the negative reviews often received long rants from the business owner explaining her position (I expect one here as well). Despite the mixed reviews, I contacted them anyway. I was pleased with their detailed and intensive program, and the proximity (convenience) to where I live. I ultimately signed up for their most expensive package. It was $1570.00 and included 10 hours of on-road instruction, plus a variety of simulator and classroom hours. Upon signing up we signed a contract and in multiple locations, agreed to their &quot;No Late Cancellations, No Exceptions&quot; policy. I didn&apos;t take exception with this policy which stated, you must cancel/reschedule a class more than 24 hours in advance or be subjected to a fee. This seemed reasonable to me. I never considered what might happen in my child woke up sick one morning that she had a class...\\n\\nThis past Monday, my daughter had a 3:30pm appointment scheduled. She woke up that morning with a fever. We took her to the doctor immediately. We also called the school immediately and informed them. Here is what we were told: We can pay a $75.00 fee for cancelling, forfeit the course (and lose the money we paid for that class) or send her in to the class. None of these options seemed reasonable to me. We were told to contact the owner (Maria) which I tried to do. I simply asked her to call me. Instead, I received a very long email stating again her policy, fairness, her business costs, and telling me she would do nothing about it. We went back and forth and it became clear that Maria has dealt with this issue before. She will not budge. However, my true issue is that she lacks any type of &quot;sick child&quot; policy. All schools have policies about sick children. Most say that your child needs to be fever free (without medication) for 24 hours prior to returning to school. That is not the case at Driving MBA. In fact, they offer a disincentive to keep your sick child home. They tell you that you will be charged a fee or lose the class if your child does not come in.\\n\\nI am not the type of parent that sends my child to school sick, especially to risk others (like students and teachers) being contaminated. Maria&apos;s response to this was that they wipe down the equipment. I know that some parents, when faced with these choices, will give their child Tylenol and send them in. Flu, chicken pox, strep, doesn&apos;t matter. I do not begrudge those parents who do, I just don&apos;t agree with that type of policy. I had hoped that Maria would have some business common sense and realize this is a flawed policy. Apparently not. I told Maria that I would not send my child back and requested a refund for my unused hours (well over $800 worth). Again, I was told, read the contract. I get to keep your money, even though I did not earn it or provide the services. Again, she&apos;s right and I did agree to that. Maria will likely respond to this post with a long-winded rant about her contract, her policies, paying employees, she&apos;s a small business, being fair to all, etc... All of this is true. However, my post is to share my personal story and let you know to be careful before you sign up. \\nThere&apos;s no mention in any contract about your child waking up sick or any sick policy at all. I believe she has a reason for not addressing this in her contract. So, I&apos;m out my money and had to find a new school. We signed up with Stop and Go Driving school https://www.stopandgo1.com/ and so far they have been fantastic! It&apos;s disappointing that I lost my money and had to pay for another school, but better than sending my child to a school that obviously allows sick kids to attend (if their parents are willing). \\n\\nNow for Maria&apos;s response in three....two....one......",

The girls liked all their instructors. The instructors have high expectations for the kids&apos; driving ability. When my daughters&apos; 16th birthday arrived, the instructors told us they needed more driving experience before they were ready to become licensed drivers. It was a disappointment for sure, but the instructors were right. We practiced for another month on our own, then the girls passed their tests w/ MBA. After the tests, MBA uploaded the info onto the ADOT system, and it was easy to go there immediately after to obtain their licenses. Communication could be a bit better. Would have appreciated someone ahead of time letting us know what to expect of the testing and licensing procedure. We received some conflicting information from employees, but it all worked out. Also: My suggestion to parents would be if your kid has a half-decent amount of road experience before they start at MBA, they can probably skip the lessons on the simulators - those lessons are really for true novices.",

Students may graduate their program when they are deemed competent drivers. Their 1.5 hour road test really evaluates a students readiness to get their driver&apos;s license.

            "description": "Driving is dangerous. Handing car keys over to your teen before they are really ready for the responsibility to get behind the wheel could have very dire consequences.\\n\\nIf you love your son or daughter and want them to be as prepared as possible to be a competent driver this is driving school to choose.  If you&apos;re considering a driving school and your goal [as the parent] is to find a driving school that will teach your teen to drive, in as little time as possible, with as little involvement from you as possible, move along and choose another driving school. Driving MBA doesn&apos;t run their business that way. As the parent of the teen driver, should you choose Driving MBA, you will be required to be involved in the process of helping your teen with practice drive time (approx 100 hours) and reinforce what Driving MBA is teaching your teen about safe driving practices.\\n\\nDriving MBA in my opinion is top notch.  They take the role they have in helping teens become responsible drivers very seriously. Their goal is to teach drivers the rules of the road and to be competent, as well as, learn to drive defensively to avoid accidents and handle unexpected situations that could put the life of your teen and/or others at risk.\\n\\nThe owner and the instructors at Driving MBA have a passion for teaching your teen to be as safe as possible when they are behind the wheel. As the parent of two teen drivers, I don&apos;t take the responsibility of allowing my teens to driving lightly, and I&apos;m thankful that this driving school doesn&apos;t either. Driving MBA expects parents to be engaged, and they expect parents to spend a lot of time with their teens driving (approx 20 hours between each lesson they give your teen). Why so many hours behind the wheel with you before your teen takes their road test?  Because ultimately you are the parent and it is your job to teach your child to be a safe driver.  There is no replacement for for your teen to have real hours of experience behind the wheel with you assisting your teen driver and evaluating their progress before you allow them to take their road test at the MVD.  Driving MBA is a support system in the process of helping your child learning to drive, but ultimately this is your teen learning to drive and you the parent are the one responsible for them being the best possible driver on the road.",

My kid truly enjoyed all the different activities that they did throughout the course of the week as they stayed engaged with a variety of different art projects. With COVID, it was a check-in via curbside (actually at the door) so I didn&apos;t get a chance to really explore all the details inside but took my kids daily sharing of activities that it was a positive experience.",

Perfect location to zen out and immerse yourself in a fabulous evening with the family or girls night! I&apos;ve hosted company parties here, girls night out, bonding with my family and Carrie and Maggie have always made my experiences so special! I&apos;m very self conscious of my lack of artistic abilities, Carrie has always encouraged me and taken extra time to make sure I&apos;m able to follow the class outline.  It doesn&apos;t matter if you are a pro or a newbie to painting. It&apos;s fun, therapeutic and always a good time. This is the best studio in the valley! Enjoy the experience, you won&apos;t regret it!",

We learned a few painting tips at the beginning of class but spent most of the three hours painting, with Carrie and her assistant walking around and giving advice as needed. I was amazed by how well everyone in the class did! We think art is this elite thing for the super talented, but really, we all have an artist inside. I definitely want to come back for a Family Fun painting class with my kids!",

Our 1st  class was on a location with Carrie at a lovely hidden gem boutique hotel resort with the most breathtaking scenery/grounds : proof (!) she is truly an artist with the ability to find gorgeous beauty wherever she goes. Lovely mimosas, coffee and pastries were a great way to come in early and shake off any tension before we sat and began. Time flew by (!) and Carrie was so laid back with no rush as I wanted to stay a bit after class and do a few finishing touches! Loved this so much!!",

I am in the Army, so online school is the only real option for me.  GCU portrays itself as a friendly online platform. The user interface and classes are great. However, this is the extent of my praise. GCU made me feel like a second-class student. \\n\\nIn order to take more than two classes, you need to put in an appeal each time which can take weeks to months to get approved, which is too slow and has thrown me off my schedule to graduate in line with my career aspirations. They are guilty of FALSE ADVERTISING. You CAN NOT finish your degree in 2 years online with how long their appeal process takes. I have kept above a 3.8 GPA, so my grades were not a factor in this long process. This appeal system actively sabotages high-achieving, heavy-hitting, motivated students. It sucks your soul, and not in a good way. \\n\\nThe student service counselors are overtasked, and you&apos;ll only get to talk to them on the phone 10-20% of the time you really need it. \\n\\nAdditionally, I have tried to apply to another college in the meantime, and it took over a month for the transcripts to arrive in the mail. But now that I am wrapping up my time with GCU and am shooting for my master&apos;s with Notre Dame, GCU has taken weeks to send the transcript, and it still hasn&apos;t arrived. I have been to five colleges, and GCU is the ONLY ONE THAT DOES NOT SEND ELECTRONIC TRANSCRIPTS, which is utterly absurd in this day and age. The hassle I have to go through to be met where I am by the administration is exhausting. \\n\\nThe transcript department refused to give me credit for two of my transcripts, and the best advice my counselor could give me was to just have them sent again. This creates time and information gaps that amount to weeks because of the time it takes GCU to receive and review them. I wish I could talk to someone in the transcript department so that I could know what the actual issue is. I despise this process and detest that GCU forces me to go through it.\\n\\nYour only point of contact is your student counselor. They are your bottleneck, and it costs your time dearly. \\n\\nThe classes are excellent. However, the administration is inexcusably and abhorrently derelict in its responsibility to care for its students. I wish I had decided to finish my degree with another college because GCU has given me more than a few gray hairs over its ineptitude. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!",

However, once you complete the program, good luck with any follow through.\\n\\nA student survey asked about classes and there was a valid concern with one professor.  GCU never followed up nor even contacted me for additional information or if it was looked into.\\n\\nIf you need transcripts for future educational needs, forget it!!  I ordered transcripts over a month ago and apparently they were lost in the mail.  Since I couldn&apos;t seem to talk to a counselor on the phone, I emailed and every time, she said &quot;let me know if they don&apos;t come in by next week.&quot;  \\n\\nI called her supervisor on Thursday and she said the counselor would contact me for about an e transcript (which the same counselor told me they no longer offered) and I did not hear from her Friday.  \\n\\nAnyway, I am accepted to  a post MA program at another university and will not be able to enter their program if my last document, GCU transcript, does not article by Wednesday.",

Not to mention they have 24 hours to respond to your concerns. So, if you have a problem on Sunday and the assignment is due Sunday they don&apos;t have to respond to your question until Monday. That means you will either get a reduction in your grade or get a zero which I received on the last assignment before I finished my degree. \\n\\nWhen I reached out to my counselor Lindsey Gonzolas when I had an issue in another class all she said was just fill out the review at the end of the class. She didn&apos;t address or care about my issue in any capacity. At one point, I was taking time off from school because I do missions for the military and she said &apos;just stop wasting time&quot; like she knows me and what was going on in my world. I think her job is just to collect money for the University.\\n\\nOne instructor was so bad when we were put into groups to complete an assignment one girl told me she cried over the way the instructor was treating her. She was going to take time away from the school to determine if she wanted to transfer or not. For a University to say they have Christian values and promote those values with their bible verses, you would think you could get a little more compassion and empathy from the instructors and counselors.\\n\\nAlso, if you want to",

            "description": "IF YOU HAVE AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMAL DO NOT ATTEND!! Terrible school, and i mean TERRIBLE. I am an onground student who made the biggest mistake coming here. First, I am an out of state transfer from North Carolina, who flew in with my emotional support animal on the first day of move ins. I had to walk from the front of campus all the way to saguaro hall with two large suitecases and a Kitten in the 100 degree heat with no help finding my dorm. I walked Up to 3 different welcome team members, and each one of them walked away and ignored me as if i didn&apos;t exist. As this semester progresses and find several issues. My sink had no running water for over 2 weeks, despite contacting maintenance on the first day of move in&apos;s, we had to wash our hands in the sink in the common room or the shower. I then have issues with my roommate and suitemate. It started with the ABUSE of my emotional support animal. I alerted public safety, SDS, my RA and my RD - they did NOTHING! After this, I decided to go home for a mental break to come back to my fridge Mysteriously unplugged with everything spoiled inside. Again, alerted My RA&apos;s and they did nothing. Throughout the last 2 months I have BEGGED SDS for a room switch, i even said i would pay extra in necessary, and of course they have done NOTHING. I have been through 3 roommate mediations, an RD mediation, spoken with housing, residence life, public safety, and housing and they all have done ZERO to help. My mental health has declined to the point where going to class is the hardest thing i have ever had to do, my grades have suffered and my emotional support animal still has not fully recovered from the abuse he suffered. The professors will never respond to your halo messages, emails or phone calls so don&apos;t bother contacting them. SDS will ignore you for days and pass you around to multiple people in the office where you&apos;ll have to reexplain everything that&apos;s happened. Residence life won&apos;t even come out of the office to speak to you unless you have a serious breakdown and beg to speak someone. Housing will Charge you a $400 termination fee for wanting to leave the campus that gave you pure PTSD. GCU IS MORE THAN THE WORSE SCHOOL I HAVE EVER ATTENDED, THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT YOUR MONEY AND WHEN YOU STOP GIVING THEM MONEY THEY&apos;LL CHARGE EXTRA FEES AND HOLD YOUR TRANSCRIPT HOSTAGE EVEN AFTER PAYING THEM. \\n\\nI am leaving this school $10,000 in debt and only anxiety to show for it. \\nThanks GCU for the extra therapy sessions i now have to get for both me and my support animal.",

Weekly check-ins are a must and the dedication level to your degree is learned as you continue to grow with the college. I believe each class had its own &quot;vibe&quot; and I mean that in the sense that sometimes professors really were engaged the entire time. The rest left the work to you, but this is defined by your purpose and drive. \\n\\nIt took me 2.5 years to get my degree because I did one class at a time, but I really appreciate the support I received. I cannot express enough how attentive my student services counselor was. I would definitely recommend Grand Canyon University to those seeking continued higher education.",

            "description": "In 2020, I started the doctorate program at Grand Canyon University. I chose the Organizational Leadership program. I had high hopes that this institution would be an excellent fit.\\n \\nIn my fifth class, I was told to agree with woke, Marxist ideology. One specific assignment stated that we must agree with a teaching framework that promoted Marxist ideas (division and anarchy). We were to articulate how and why we would include Marxist ideas in our teaching practices. The assignment never asked if we agreed with it. We were told to agree with it. We had to explain how we were going to incorporate racist teaching strategies in our classroom. Students who did not comply with this demand faced reduced scores for thinking independently.\\n \\nAfter completing the assignment (without racist teaching ideas), the professor stated that I did not explain how I would divide my class by race. Secondly, the professor told me that I failed to incorporate social justice into my teaching practice. I told the professor I did not agree with Culturally Responsive Teaching. The professor redirected me to the expectations of the assignment and expressed no concern over the issue I presented. I actually asked the professor if students are required to lie to earn a good grade in the class. Essentially, those who do not agree are forced to lie to earn a good grade. \\n \\nIn the end, my final score for the class was dropped due to non-compliance and independent thinking; I disagree with the Marxist agenda. I filed a formal review of my grade with the review committee. I asked if the institution had ethical teaching practices. Shall it be acceptable for teachers to demand that students lie in order to pass their classes? Can students get marked down for adhering to ethical or biblical standards? Why should this even be an issue at an institution that claims to be &quot;Christian&quot;? Shall professors ask students to violate the Bible? [Social Justice is not Biblical Justice. See Owen Strachan, Voddie Baucham, John MacArthur, Scott David Allen, Thaddeus Williams, Allie B. Stuckey, and Alisa Childers.]\\n \\nAdditionally, the textbook was awful. It was woke, Marxist indoctrination. I was shocked and saddened that a &quot;Christian&quot; institution would approve of such a divisive, unbiblical textbook. The professor pointed students to Dr. Geneva Gay who advocates for social justice, promotes the teaching of whiteness, and encourages racial division in the classroom. Per the professor, Gay&apos;s framework was a positive example that students were to follow. This is what Christian leaders are supposed to emulate per Grand Canyon University?\\n \\nIf you are curious if the institution still believes in these themes, search for &quot;culturally responsive&quot; in the staff profile page. More than one teacher pops up. You will find these ideas right there on the GCU website. Or, email the academic dean of your area of expertise, ask them specifically if these Marxist ideas are still being taught at GCU (whiteness, white privilege, racial injustice, diversity, inclusion, and equity). \\n \\nIf you are uncertain about Culturally Responsive Teaching, Christopher Rufo released a video on Critical Race Theory and he calls out Culturally Responsive Teaching. PragerU also has a video about education that highlights Culturally Responsive Teaching as well (Miseducation). Within this teaching framework, students are encouraged to express their inner rage about America or people of another color. Teachers are reprogrammed to function as social justice counselors. Students become social justice warriors. \\n \\nSocial Justice is not biblical justice. You can read &quot;Fault Lines&quot; by Voddie Baucham to learn more. Watch a video by Voddie Baucham entitled &quot;Social Justice v. Biblical Justice&quot;. Or, you can read &quot;Why Social Justice is Not Biblical Justice&quot; by Scott David Allen. I also recommend &quot;Christianity and Wokeness&quot; by Owen Strachan. Lastly, read &quot;Confronting Injustice without Compromising Truth: 12 Questions Christians Should Ask About Social Justice&quot; by Thaddeus Williams. These works are helpful to understand the problem addressed here.\\n\\nThe Resolution Team received my thoughts in a 38-page document. They did not actively try to connect with me on the matter. They simply said it was &quot;received&quot;. This message came from Rebecca Loar. I have no evidence that they wish to resolve the matter.",

            "description": "I completed a Master&apos;s degree from Grand Canyon University, completely online. It was challenging and I did not have overly-supportive professors -- but I finished it quickly and graduated with a GPA just under 4.0. \\n\\nHowever. Post-graduation, GCU&apos;s &quot;customer service&quot; is terrible! I have taught high school 11 years in the west and (because of my husband&apos;s job) have moved to a state on the east coast. In order to get my teaching certificate here, I needed official transcripts from my undergraduate and graduate schools. My undergraduate was at WSU, where I ordered a transcript online in under 2 minutes. GCU is not automated (weird for an online school). The only option is to call and speak to my &quot;advisor.&quot; After being on a lengthy hold, I was told that he was with a student and to leave a message. It took several attempts before I got through to him. I found out after the fact (from him)  that he had been out of town the whole week, yet every time I called student services told me he &quot;was with a student.&quot; After this long delay they then told me they had to MAIL the transcript! I had ordered an electronic transcript just 2 months earlier. I was told that was only because of Covid and they had since stopped doing electronic transcripts. The trouble was -- my application was all digital. All my forms were submitted to a digital application with Dept of Ed. I tried to explain this and was told &quot;no exceptions!&quot; I took it to a supervisor (which took one whole day for him to get back to me) and his position was that the Dept of Ed had to make the exception, not GCU. I had to call my state Dept of Ed to get an address for the mailed transcript. More and more delays. \\n\\nThe transcript was finally sent. Then the Dept of Ed required a verification form to be filled out by the &quot;preparing institution.&quot; So I had to start the process all over again. This time I had to speak with my &quot;counselor.&quot; And OF COURSE she was not available. I left three messages on her VM. Finally, after much pleading GCU allowed me to talk to another counselor, who had me email the form to my counselor of record, saying it would be processed by &quot;the end of the day.&quot; That was three weeks ago!! Nothing. I have called and left messages once a week and emailed her once a week (for three weeks). SHE HAS NOT REPLIED TO A SINGLE MESSAGE OR EMAIL. And she did not send the form. \\n\\nI started my new job 2 weeks ago. The school had to remand me to substitute status: I am paid the sub per diem (significantly less), I cannot have medical benefits, and I do not accrue sick leave. Until the Dept of Ed gets that form. One form is holding everything up! \\n\\nToday I got an email from a completely different counselor, telling me I have to submit an additional form before GCU will send the verification form. On this form I have to confirm that &quot;the state I reside in does not require test scores before issuing a certificate.&quot; But the state does require test scores -- and I have already sent them my test scores. My Praxis, West-E, and West-B test scores have nothing to do with GCU. I didn&apos;t take the tests through GCU, this is not their preview! I am SO frustrated!! I feel like I&apos;m being held hostage by this school. \\n\\nAnd every time I call -- I have to go through the gauntlet with the &quot;student services&quot; (which is a misnomer if I ever heard one -- they are the opposite of service) person BEFORE I can talk to a counselor or advisor. I have to give them my address, my phone number, my social security number, my email address, AND I have to answer a security question. Every. Single. Time. And then I&apos;m put on hold forever. Just to get a voicemail recording. Make an online option available!! It&apos;s 2022!\\n\\nSo, if you&apos;re thinking of attending GCU, because its a nice online option -- be warned! GCU does not care about their students after they graduate.",

            "description": "With school about to commence, I wanted to express my thoughts regarding Mission Montessori on the Desert. Some parents may still be searching for the &quot;right&quot; school for their young ones, so in light of that, I recommend highly Mission Montessori to any parent with grade school or preschool-aged children.\\n\\n1. During the two years my son attended, I found the teachers to be compassionate and very attentive to my child&apos;s needs. They are well-trained educators, and each day my child shared something new with me that he&apos;d learned that day.\\n2. I found that the communication among the Administration, Staff &amp; Parents was always strong and on point - never lacking.\\n3. I always felt comfortable leaving my son in the hands of Staff at Mission, and he never cried or was upset when I&apos;d check him in each school day. I never worried that he wasn&apos;t being attended to - but was at peace that he&apos;d be cared for.\\n4. If I felt my son was having an &quot;off&quot; day, I always had someone to talk to in the Administration or with his Teachers to discuss, and who were genuinely concerned.\\n5. Each classroom is beautifully appointed for each age/grade with high-quality Montessori materials. That was a very big plus.\\n6. Unfortunately, my son last year had to attend first grade at a public school because we had moved. He entered first grade making all A&apos;s, and I was proud that Mission had prepared my son so well.  My greatest wish is to have another wonderful Mission Montessori near us on the West side of the Valley! Hello, Mission Montessori - did you hear me?\\n7. After this first year at public/traditional school, there is definitely a very big difference in the number of teaching Staff. Traditional schools have 1 teacher to 30-35 students.  Mission Montessori has a 1 to 10 ratio - and there are at least 3 adults in a Primary/Kindergarten classroom. Public/traditional falls short, and our children are the ones who suffer.\\nIn closing, I&apos;ll keep hoping for a Montessori close by to enroll my son in next year. If any parent reading this &quot;rather long note&quot; lives close to a Montessori School, I urge you to send your child/children. Their schools are far above traditional education for young minds. Well worth a financial sacrifice!\\n\\n\u200bJudy U",

            "description": "Mission Montessori on the Desert is a fantastic school! All 3 of our children started in the preschool program and thrived! We have 2 girls and 1 boy, each child has a unique personality, and different needs and strengths. Mission Montessori was an excellent choice for all of my children because the teachers allow the children to be independent. My children learned at their own pace, when they were interested in a topic (this is called a sensitive period), and with an appropriate amount of structure. My oldest is in 6th grade now and is still thriving! My younger children are in 3rd and 1st grade, sharing the same classroom, on the lower elementary classroom and thriving as well. Many people have a misconception that children in a Montessori school are wandering around all day. I can assure you, that is not the case. There is a purpose to everything the children do, even though many times the children (and even the parents) are unaware. For example, in preschool, the children learn fine motor skills but cutting and pasting pieces of paper, sewing large buttons to make bracelets, etc. They learn large motor skills by washing windows and chairs. Each of these &quot;works&quot; is taught and is executed in a way that children learn to setup, follow simple steps, do things in order from left to right (since we read left to right), and cleanup. The beauty of all of this is the children independently select the work they want to do from the large variety of options. So they are interested in the work they are doing and are learning in the process. When they reach kindergarten age, the children have workplans and they must complete academic work (math and language) before they move onto other works in the classroom. But the children select the order in which they complete the academic work, so they maintain their independence. If a child is ever struggling on how to proceed, the teacher will make appropriate suggestions. In addition to the classroom work, the children have gardening where they learn about natures and planting with thoughtful lessons and hands-on work (the children plant and harvest the garden.) This is our 8th year at Mission Montessori and I am still amazed each time I am in the classroom at how focused the children are and how much they quietly collaborate with each other. The older children take pride in helping the younger children. The teachers are caring, dedicated, knowledgable, and simply phenomenal. Each of my children is different and it was absolutely the right choice for all of them. They all excel in math and language and have a love of learning.",

Master Maui did a wonderful job in making the various activities-zip line, beach ball dodgeball, shipwreck, etc.-both exciting and safe. He&apos;s a native of Hawaii and a carpenter by training, and he built out his dojo himself. Very impressive! After checking out his YouTube videos, I&apos;m convinced that he&apos;s also well-equipped to teach martial arts and self-defense.",

My daughter gained a lot of confidence and I really felt like I stepped out of my box.  Master Maui and Master Darren packed all kinds of skills and info into every class. They create such a safe fun environment, you feel you can do anything, like fend off a larger attacker, or jump out of a window if necessary or defend your family. We met so many other nice people too. The dojo is like a big family.\\nMy son is taking the Tiger Warriors class now, and he loves it. I am taking the ninjitsu adult class. Even though there are many different skill levels, I don&apos;t feel intimidated or left out. We do something fun every class, and the other students are more than helpful. There is an even mix of men and women and all different ages. \\nIt is really eye opening to see the girls sparring with the guys. Very empowering, even to a peaceful, nonviolent old lady like me.",

We learned how to defend ourselves if someone grabbed us, get out of a chokehold, disarm a gunman and knifeman, etc. On top of that the class was so much fun and Master Maui is a great teacher.",

            "description": "Saito Bloodline Ninjitsu is the real deal. I am someone who has previously studied a Japanese martial art (shotokan). So I know something about karate. First of all let me say that Master Maui is a very personable, friendly and all around great person. On top of that, he knows how to teach. That is very important. I was looking for a martial arts studio that taught real life self defense and fighting techniques. It&apos;s a dangerous world out there. Most martial arts studios don&apos;t teach real life combat skills. As a child my son studied Taekwondo. While that was fun, it didn&apos;t really teach fighting skills. Most high level belts of that school couldn&apos;t fight their way out of wet paper bag. Krav Maga is popular today because of this very fact. It emerged to teach real fighting skills where traditional martial arts faltered. Now, let&apos;s talk about Saito Ninjitsu - It is Krav Maga on steroids. Much, much more. I started studying with Master Maui after my son, now a police officer, had been studying with him a few years. My son has tried some of the techniques taught here on me. And frankly, he has put me in more pain than I have ever experienced in my life (and I&apos;m a big strong guy). These techniques really work and every police officer should attend his law enforcement classes for their own safety. I have learned some, well, brutal techniques that would disable any attacker. I have no desire to break anyone&apos;s bones, but in a bad situation, I might have to. Master Maui also teaches realistic blocking techniques. Much better than my former Shotokan blocks. Oh, and speaking of Master Maui, how often do you get the chance to train with a true Master? It&apos;s actually pretty rare. Another advantage of Saito Ninjitsu is the fact that I can control someone with very workable locking techniques. In other martial arts you basically punch and kick your way to victory over an opponent. Hopefully your opponent is not too big or he&apos;s not a better puncher than you. I&apos;d rather, throw some quick counter attacks, then lock him up and hold him for the police. As you would expect, any ancient Japanese martial art has a spiritual component to it. I have to say, that is a very intriguing aspect of Saito Ninjitsu as well.",

            "description": "I am not one to post a lot of reviews, and when I do I am brutally honest. So with that in mind, I have to say that Maui Saito Ninjitsu is by far the best and most unique program I have ever seen. My 7 year old has been doing it for just under a year and loves it. It is not your typical program where the kids stand in rows and practice moves of katas. Master Maui teaches them unique skills that would help them if ever caught in a bad situation. The kids are having so much fun that they don&apos;t even realize they are getting a valuable lesson. They are also learning how to focus when there is distraction and get out of dangerous situations. You kind of have to see it for yourself to truly get an understanding of it. On top of that, some of the moves they learn are amazing.. It doesn&apos;t matter how small you are for Ninjitsu to be effective. I have seen my 7 year old take down a kid who is twice his size and weight. It is certainly a great confidence builder and a way for kids to deal with bullies if ever put in the situation.\\n\\nNow on to Master Maui... I can sincerely say he is one of the nicest people I have ever met and  his dojo like a big family. He is great with the kids and a fantastic teacher to say the least. You can tell he truly cares about the kids and loves what he does. He was taught Ninjitsu by his father in Hawaii, you can read the unique history on his website. \\n\\nAs I said, it is the kind of thing you have to see to fully get an understanding of it. I guarantee it is not like anything you have ever seen. We found it by chance when looking at different schools that were close to home. I am certainly glad we did and have no doubt my son will stick with it. I honestly can&apos;t say enough good things about the school or Master Maui... If you are looking for a place, I couldn&apos;t recommend it enough.",

Study Skills &amp; Learning Styles)\\n* Does your child struggle in school?\\n* Not living up his or her potential?\\n* Not turning in their work or not doing well on tests?\\n* Spending no time or too much time doing homework?\\n* Are you constantly fighting with your student to get them to do school work?\\n* Are they embracing the definition of insanity - doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome? \\n\\n.... My middle school child is struggling to... turn in home work, study for tests and organization, all of which, this is supposed to tackle. So I signed him up.  You get a FREE one on one assessment consultation, then 4 sessions (1 hour long).  $180 Plus an annual registration fee.  My child is worth the money, so we try it.\\n\\nAssessment:  I spoke to the head honcho at S.E.C., Dave, for our assessment.  He seemed very educated and enthusiastic that this class will change my child.   He stated that my child had some movement issues and he knew the perfect instructor for my child for this class. \\n\\n4 sessions (1 hour long):  Effective us of a Daily Planner; Taking Notes based on the Student&apos;s Learning Style; Memorization and Research Techniques; and, Prepping for Tests. Many students will continue with regularly scheduled homework support or subject tutoring.\\n\\nScheduling the sessions:  I called and scheduled the classes, all 4 of them.  They asked when it was convenient for me to bring him in.  I thought this was strange because Dave said he had a specific person for him, but maybe this person is always available, so I let it go.  I schedule two days for the first week, then two days for the second week.  I am not sure if we did all 4 session consecutively if it would have been any better. Probably not.\\n\\nSession 1-Plan of attack)  My child states that he sat at a very large table with many other instructors and many students, all in the same room.  To me this is a distraction -- not a good place for a child who is easily distracted.   I have no idea if my child got the instructor that Dave was referring to, but what can I do? This is also the session where they learn how to fill out the planner properly.  He says he took notes, filled out a worksheet and made a contract. \\n\\nSession 2-Taking Notes) I purchased the planner before this class, in hopes that it would make a difference.  My child states that he didn&apos;t learn anything new.  He also stated that a child complained for a long time about the classes they are taking and it was very annoying.  After session two, SEC asked for credentials for school login, to view grades, etc.\\n\\nSession 3-Research) My child admits to me that he only fills out the planner before going to his session at SEC so he won&apos;t get in trouble.  He tells me he is learning stuff that he already knows (easy bib).  Looking at his grades now, after three sessions (no improvement).  Still doing the same things.\\n\\nSession 4-Test Taking / Study Skills) Same thing, my child admits to me he still hasn&apos;t learned anything new.\\n\\nThis class did absolutely NOTHING for him.  After taking the classes, he is still doing the same things.  Big waste of money!    \\n\\nPersonally, I feel.... these changes could benefit S.E.C.\\n1st... I feel....This class should included the PLANNER that they teach to.  It&apos;s $10, just make the class $10 more expensive. I found out after the first session that it was NOT included.  I had to ask for it personally.  Nobody even asked me if we wanted it before the class. \\n\\n2nd... I feel....they should teach this class on a regular schedule, with the same kids, not a revolving schedule .  Meaning it should be offered weekly or bi-monthly option, like a scheduled class.  As for now, each class can have up to 3 students and not always the same 3 students.  I&apos;m not sure how the kids sit with one another, but to me this seems like it can be very distracting for a kid who is unfocused.  My child told me during one session, a kid complained how hard a specific class was for them and they discussed it for 30 minutes - How will this organize/help my child? \\n\\n3rd... I feel....The logon credentials should be asked for on the first day of class.  When they looked at my child&apos;s grades,   They sent me a report stating that they looked at my child&apos;s &quot;School Website&quot; classes/grades.  The report just stated the obvious, which was happening BEFORE we went there and I already knew about.\\n\\nI feel....If you don&apos;t know what is wrong with your child because you are clueless (haven&apos;t check grades, aren&apos;t around when child is supposed to be doing school work or have no time to figure it out), then maybe this class is for your child, otherwise, save your money.",

            "description": "I had a great conversation with the owner initially about our son who is 17.  Our son needed SAT prep as well as a tutor for Algebra III.  We were hoping for 1-on-1 tutoring for some sessions, but the 1-on-1 turned out to be one tutor and one student in a room filled with other tutors and students, all talking at once.  Our son has 3 mild learning differences, dyslexia, ADHD and auditory processing.  While in the office to pay our bill, I mentioned to the receptionist that our son had taken one of the SAT prep tests with a lot of other talking &amp; lessons going on in the background, and that this was distracting for him, as he had several learning differences.  She immediately asked me to whisper about it.  What?  I have never been asked to talk about my children&apos;s learning disabilities in hushed tones.  It was as if that was a taboo subject to discuss in the office, even though there were only two other adults present, and they appeared to be staff.  Wow!!!  I have raised 4 children, 3 of whom are dyslexic and so am I.  I have never been uncomfortable or embarrassed to talk about learning differences.  Nor should anyone else.  I have raised my children to know themselves, strengths and struggles in all, to advocate for themselves and to understand that having a learning disability does not limit them in anyway!!!!  In fact, my kids are capable of anything, and have amazing gifts in the areas of music, art, English (yes!!!), sports, science and technology.  I have taught at some of the most amazing and prominent public and private schools, and never have I been &quot;shushed&quot; when it came to openly and honestly asking for what a child needs.  If this is a place that is testing children as well, I would definitely look elsewhere!  Look for a place that truly understand learning differences, gifts and struggles in all, and are not embarrassed to talk about it.  And look for a place where 1-on-1 is just that, in a quite space with few distractions.",

The program and the tutors available with Scottsdale Education Center were extremely helpful, knowledgeable, kind and patient.

Overall, I really appreciated their SAT and ACT practice tests, which significantly helped me improve my scores. Additionally, Kim Duckworth&apos;s personalized college counseling advice helped me narrow down my target college choices and plan my senior year to reach my goals. I am happy to say that I was accepted into multiple Ivy League schools and top universities with the help I received from the center. The teachers that work here are committed to making sure each student understands what they are learning and is working to their maximum capacity. I highly recommend trying out Scottsdale Education Center for help in any subject or test. All you need to bring with you is a motivated and &quot;can-do&quot; attitude!",

They make sure you cover and understand the material, and they&apos;re really approachable -  the class is not intimidating, nor is it just a boring script.  They are not only knowledgeable about the course content, they&apos;re also skilled at explaining in a way that helps you remember and use it.  Since the classes are generally small, they have time to tailor their teaching to  students&apos; needs/experiences; a seasoned trauma nurse and a fresh-out-of-school RN could both feel comfortable and engaged in the same class.  \\n\\nAlso, they have fair prices and it&apos;s easy to schedule, either the traditional class or the blended online class with in-person skills session.

Every musical group sang cover songs from Alexander Hamilton and the choreography by the groups was a tad lacking. Harding&apos;s Cafeteria is another prime example of Lipscomb University&apos;s monopoly on the Church of Christ Christian college market. Compared to Lipscomb the cafeteria has quantity above quality. I believe student life at Harding University is the highlight of the campus but Lipscomb has a clear advantage in every other facet.",

It was smart that they have 3 separate graduation ceremonies throughout the day for different departments. It is a very nice &amp; well-kept campus, I will give them that.\\n\\nMost of the reasons I don&apos;t like the school stem from hearing about my sister&apos;s &amp; brother-in-law&apos;s experience here. For one, the campus postal service lost their marriage license. They originally transferred from Texas A&amp;M, so some of the staff members treated them like they were heathens (or otherwise non-believers), despite the fact that they were believers. They were held to a much stricter code here than if they were living in their own homes, &amp; treated more like kids than the adults they are. It was also stricter than Lubbock Christian University, where I had my college experience. (For &quot;faith purposes&quot;, Harding comes across as one of the more &quot;legalistic&quot; of the Christian colleges &amp; universities throughout America.)\\n\\nMy sister also had to jump thru a lot of hoops with the academic advisors, to make sure that her classes all transferred &amp; she received credit. She was glad that she only had to spend that year (&amp; graduate in July), &amp; no more! (She was just &quot;following&quot; her husband, since Harding was the physical therapy program that accepted him.)\\n\\nMy brother-in-law was also overjoyed that he didn&apos;t need to spend more than 3 years for his degree! He was also on his own to find his clinical rotations during the last half of his program. (I went to Texas Tech for pharmacy school, &amp; they had a specific staff member who was in charge of coordinating clinical rotations. Maybe Harding&apos;s PT [&amp;/or pharmacy school, etc] will look into that for future classes.)\\n\\nFor other personal reasons, I was glad to know that Harding also had a pharmacy school, as well as a physical therapy program. And I&apos;m also glad to know they have sought ways to improve, so they can reach more people.",

For those that know me...I am an easy going person, that always has a positive out look on people.  But my KID WAS PUBLICLY SHAMED AND HURT IN FRONT OF PEERS TODAY. \\nMy daughter was taking her driving hours at FROST,  we did parent taught for the first half, but wanted to get extra hours with an instructor so she would feel more comfortable behind the wheel, because my daughter was in a accident as passenger when she was 14 and almost lost her leg, she was hospitalized for over a month with multiple surgeries and had to finish out her school year at home.   When Elexis started her first hours,  I asked the instructor (Pam) how Elexis did and she said &quot;good&apos;.  A few driving hours later,  I get a call that Elexis had an accident in the drivers education car with Pam in the passenger seat.   The cops were at the scene and I was told that Elexis had ran a two way stop sign ( a white truck was parked in front of the sign), and the other car &quot;t-boned&quot; the front passenger wheel base.  My kid was extremely upset for days not wanting to ever drive again.   I noticed that instead of the instructor using this as a teaching tool, Pam was blaming ALL the fault on Elexis!   When I got home, I called the driving school to speak to the owner, the owner called me back and I explained to him how I did not like how Pam was blaming and belittling my daughter in front of the police officer.  Pam is the instructor and &quot;accidents&quot; happen.  Really...did Pam not see the stop sign either???  Did Pam have a break pad to use??  After the nice conversation it was agreed that Elexis would finish her hours with a different instructor.  After the completion of Elexis hours we waited to get Elexis more driving time on the home front, and went today July 10, 2017 to book the driving test,   Elexis and I walked into the driving school to register for the test slot at 1:40pm.  I looked back and saw Pam sitting at a table with other students.   When we sat down I heard Pam say very loudly &quot; IS SHE TESTING TODAY&apos;?  The lady behind the desk nodded her head yes.  I turned around and I gave Pam the &quot;thumbs up&quot; with a smile and told her &quot;Lexi is ready!  Lexi is going to pass.  We have been practicing,&quot; with a nice genuine smile.  I noticed that Pam was glaring at me and Elexis with a rude look on her face.   Pam stood up and said with people in the lobby &quot;YEA IF NO ONE IS IN THE CAR&quot; directly to me and my teenager.  The receptionist looked at us and started to apologize for what was just said to us in front of a lobby full of her peers.   Elexis stood up and walked out the door not saying a word.  I sat there and finished the paperwork so upset tears were rolling down my face.  Again the receptionist was apologizing to me for what the instructor Pam had said.  I went to check on Elexis in the truck.  My teenager was crying her eyes out saying that she did not want to take her test anymore she was embarrassed and could not believe that adults acted this way.  I tried to calm her down the best I could.  NEXT, I went back into FROST driving school and asked the instructor Pam, &quot;why did you say that to us?, you have no idea what my child has been though what she has had to endure to get here!  You should be ashamed of your self! You are a teacher, and instructor, this is not how you act!  Pam proceeded to be RUDE, MEAN, AND UNPROFESSIONAL!  Pam, expressed to me that I should be ashamed of myself as a parent to put my daughter behind the wheel,  Pam also stated that Elexis can not feel with her foot ( WHICH IS NOT TRUE!!)  JUST BECAUSE MY TEENAGER HAS A PARTIAL DISABILITY WITH RANGE OF MOTION, AND YOU THE DRIVING INSTRUCTOR INSTEAD OF LIFTING UP MY CHILD, AND TEACHING MY CHILD.  PAM COMPLETELY ACTED UNPROFESSIONAL AND PUBLICLY SHAMED MY CHILD.  THIS INSTRUCTOR NEEDS TO LOOSE HER LICENSE FOR WHAT SHE HAS DONE.  I ALSO HAVE PROOF FROM OTHER STUDENTS THAT SHE SPEAKS BAD OF OTHER STUDENT DRIVERS TO HER STUDENTS DURING BEHIND THE WHEEL INSTRUCTION.",

Oh no!) they only accept appointments now.  Next available was over a month out.  We called Coach Frost and amazingly, he was able to get us in that evening.  My daughter did great, passed her test, and coach Frost was a pleasure to deal with.  We met in Cedar Park across from ACC in the Lakehills Freewill Baptist Church parking lot.  Coach sets up the parallel parking cones there, and once that step is done, he takes the driver out to drive around some of the neighborhoods.  We were in and out within 30 minutes.  The best!!!",

He was so prepared to the point he provided the class with binders that included all of the information he was showing on the screen.  All we had to do was make a few notes if we wanted which allowed us to pay attention to what he was showing and saying.  He is extremely patient and goes out of his way to be sure every student understands what he is saying.  I don&apos;t care how long you&apos;ve been photographing, I&apos;m pretty sure you&apos;ll learn something new.  If you&apos;re a beginner this is definitely the class to be in.

I signed up for his basic course after thinking that I probably need to pick up a hobby to fill my time during retirement. From day 1, Kevin was very responsive and sent reminders about locations and class days. He is an amazing teacher that used stories and analogies to get his points across. After so many courses in the military, I didn&apos;t know how to react when faced with an instructor that genuinely cares about teaching and just wants the world to enjoy the beauty of photography. I enjoyed every session and plan on signing up for another class with him to learn about lighting. as far as pricing, i dont know what the normal price points are for these types of classes. I found him on yelp and I was very happy with my ROI.",

Yes it was a a fun weekend, and yes I remember everything!\\n\\nWith the Waco Wine Tour you get to stop at three wineries and sample about 5-6 samples at each winery. There is also a stop at a vineyard (and unfortunately we didn&apos;t go at the right season), but you get to see where all the vines and grapes grow, as well as have a delicious snack from a nearby market!\\n\\nI found some great wine I liked and our tour guide Joey was amazing! Our guide was friendly, knowledgeable, patient, and answered every random question we could think of. He let us have alone time, giving us the right amount or privacy, but was always engaging and positive when we wanted to include him in girl time. \\n\\nI&apos;m so glad I got this as my first wine tour experience, and if I&apos;m ever in the area, I will have to come back and take the tour again... as well as buy some delicious wine!",

Dave, Rob and the rest of the instructors make the experience totally fun, enjoyable, and non-intimidating. It seems like an overwhelming amount of information to take on in such a short amount of time (and honestly they will be the first ones to tell you that it is), but the instructors are all super patient and fun and their attitude makes you want to just keep trying and trying again. It&apos;s like being told the way you know how to drive a car is completely wrong and you need to re-learn everything all at once...but it&apos;s a total blast while you&apos;re doing it. \\n\\nAnd honestly, even with all the great fun you&apos;ll have throwing around rally cars in the dirt, the best part for me what just the sense of camaraderie and community the people at RR have built there. I would honestly be just as happy going down there to hang out and talk with all the great guys and just chill out. The culture is so fun and inviting. \\n\\nYes it&apos;s a little pricey, but it&apos;s totally worth saving up for the experience. (They do a great job on their site of explaining why it&apos;s worth it...and it is). I totally want to do it again and try some of their other class offerings sometime...but also just to spend time with a great group of people (and dogs!)\\n\\nJust remember though...the tomatoes are store-bought. :)",

It was a BLAST! Neither of us have any racing or rally driving experience, but my husband loves Subarus and had heard this was a cool experience so figured why not try it out. There were 6 of us in our session and none of us had any experience with rally driving. The instructors were super chill and made everyone feel very comfortable. They take you around a lap first before you drive yourself. I drove the automatic car since I hadn&apos;t driven a manual in 15+ years, but one of the instructors patiently (re-)taught me how to use the manual on the fly and I got to try a lap in that car as well, which was definitely a confidence booster! \\n\\nThe laps you drive are super fun, but the real fun is doing the hot lap with one of the instructors. Holy hell, that was one of the most fun, adrenaline packed experiences I&apos;ve ever had!! They definitely make you feel like you can become a rally driver in no time!! Would 100% recommend this!!!",

I sent a pretty open-ended email a few weeks prior saying what we were looking for, and Dave got back to me quickly w/ a perfect proposal, combining some driving and ride-along in UTVs. Very easy payment system too. When one of the guys wasn&apos;t going to be able to make it, RR was very flexible on the pricing change. Once we were there, they walked us through a straightforward training/guidelines, and cut us loose. The UTVs take some getting used to but felt really safe on the track and in the woods. The ride-along is insane (and inspiring)... At the end of the few hours we hung out with their dogs with some great memories and pictures.",

Our class of 7 people had zero experience racing before, and we were all drifting through turns, flooring it through corners, power braking and kicking up rooster tails of dirt with huge grins plastered our faces the whole time!\\n\\nHighly recommend this incredibly professional team of racing teachers, who really stick with you to make sure you learn the skills and have a complete blast while you&apos;re doing it.

But at the end of the day when we put into action all the skills we had just learned on the mini-rally course at the Ranch, we actually DID it!

We were abusing those cars and tearing them apart but they were fixing them as fast as we were ripping off tires and bumpers. It was DIRTY and educational and most importantly super damn good times. My only complaint was the weather came in hard and rained out our 3rd day, but Dave said, &apos;well now you all got a day credit so come back and we&apos;ll have even more courses for you guys to shred.&apos; He then took us off-roading  in his jeep on a tour of his acres then launched us over a jump, (chainsaws and all) for his entertainment as much as ours. :) Needless to say, we will all be returning to Austin.",

So we got the idea of sending them to a driving school and we spent the next several months trying to find something super cool for them, have a ton of fun, and safely learn to truly drive a car in extreme situations. We searched high and low and contacted numerous places. We ultimately decided on Ralky Ready after all our research. Dave answered all our calls and questions and he was by far the easiest to work with. So we booked hotels and flights and decided to take the leap. Boy did Rally Ready hit the ball out of the park we could not have been more pleased. Dave and his Team exceeded our expectations and that of my kids by a mile. They had so much fun, drove for two straight days and have not been able to stop talking about the experience.  The things they learned most drivers on the road will never learn, taking a car to the edge of its performance envelope than learning with expert instruction how to recover that vehicle back onto the course can only be done in a facility like this. You could just see their confidence soar from the first day to the next.  What was so impressive about the place was the ease that the instructors moved back and forth between novice drivers such as my kids and professional drivers coming to the facility to all get better.  Having that level of comfort and trust with your instructor makes the learning that much more fun and meaningful.  Facilities were great and would recommend this to anyone at any level.  Thank you again Dave and please extend a double thumbs up to your entire crew.",

This was my first time EVER going to a gunsmith, and it went really well thanks to TIM! What makes this even better, is that he&apos;s not a 20 year old who graduated YOUTUBE university! He&apos;s a reliable man who has gone through REAL training to do what he does today. I&apos;m grateful we still have people who are passionate about the SAFETY of guns and not how fast the money comes! Thanks Tim!",

I bought 2 pistols and 1 rifle online and had them shipped to Tim. He inspected them and emailed me as soon as they arrived. Scheduling a pickup through his website is super easy.  I dropped my old guns for him to clean and service and it took a little while for him to work on them. He was extremely busy over the holidays, but it was worth the wait.  I have an old WWII Enfield rifle with a barrel that WAS caked with copper from shooting 50 years ago. Tim got it sparkling clean like brand new. Reasonable prices too. I highly recommend Tim Smith Gunsmith for all your gun needs in the Austin/Georgetown area. Plus he&apos;s a super nice guy.",

He finished 2nd grade unable to do basic subtraction.  When I asked for an evaluation for special services through the local public school district, First Baptist didn&apos;t really cooperate. When it came time for the meeting to discuss results, the principal hid in his office and sent a &quot;proxy&quot; who didn&apos;t do anything but sit with his head down the entire time. No one was interested in getting him the help he needed.  I was at a loss as to what to do. At the end of the year his standardized testing results came back below average in every area and in the lower 10-15% nationally.  Thankfully I found a school willing to work to catch him up. Within 2 years he was performing in the 75-90% on his standardized testing, which tells me my child wasn&apos;t to biggest component in his learning issue there.\\n\\nReligiously he received a so - so education.  I know others have reviewed with huge marks for the religious aspect, but if your instruction doesn&apos;t match how things play out in real life it&apos;s useless.\\n\\nLastly, their sports crowds tend to show very poor sportsmanship. I know that&apos;s hard to believe,  given what the other reviews boast, but from the outside looking in,  their behavior at sporting events ( in my experience) has been in poor taste.",

It has both mac and pc&apos;s which is a rarity for university computer labs and all the cpu&apos;s are apple&apos;s so its fast and everything.\\n\\nNow the main reason I&apos;m writing this is because of the bathroom in the ground floor by the vending machines. I can&apos;t speak for the girls one but the boys one absolutely smells horrendous. I&apos;ve smelled some nasty bathrooms in my lifetime and I could honestly say that there would be no difference in the fragrance of the restroom if I decided to take a piss on the floor instead of the urinal...

            "description": "I hated UIUC with a passion, however, as time has passed, I&apos;ve begun to realize that UIUC made me what I am today. It gave me all the necessary tools to succeed. It is truly my Alma Mater.\\n\\nI was an international undergraduate student at UIUC, which has a great support system for international students. We had special counselors and staff to help us get adjusted to the American way of life. \\n\\nI majored in electrical engineering and minored in chemistry, and took my stay here extremely seriously. The fact that my family was paying three times the fees local students pay, failure wasn&apos;t an option for me. I never partied during my stay here. \\n\\nMy review is only concerning the College of Engineering.\\n\\nUIUC has very high standards. Every ECE course is like an honors course. No matter how impressive your ACT or SAT scores are or how smart you think you are, there will always be someone better than you are at UIUC. I learned this the hard way. Don&apos;t despair; befriend those people and study with them. They&apos;ll help you survive.\\n\\nOur ECE department is one of the best in the country; our instructors are the very best in the industry and graduates of top schools - whether local or international. For example, many of my professors and TAs were graduates of the Indian Institute of Technology - considered one of the best institution and most selective in the world. They seemed weird and aloof at times, but they were very approachable and were always available for additional help.\\n\\nI had professors who were graduates of MIT, Yale and CalTech.\\n\\nThe university also hosted various international speakers of high caliber - like Bill Gates and Ravi Zacharias. It was great to see these men in person and hear them speak.\\n\\nUIUC also had great worship nights for Christians.\\n\\nThe university also hosted various international events like Diwali nights and Indian dance competitions.\\n\\nHere are five tips for surviving the College of Engineering:\\n\\n1. Get into a study group with people who are smarter than you. This will help you work in a team.\\n2. Do your homework - yourself. Only get help if you get stuck.\\n3. Do the old exams in your study group.\\n4. Sleep at night.\\n5. In additional to your studies, do an extra project or thesis in order to make your resume more impressive.\\n\\nAfter four years of broken hearts, failed exams, and sleepless nights, I successfully graduated from ECE. I can proudly say that I studied with the brightest people in the world. I actually miss those days and can think of so many things I would have done differently if given a second chance.\\n\\nRahul G (BSEE)",

            "description": "Alumni - I returned for Homecoming and almost didn&apos;t recognize the campus. What was once an incredibly beautiful campus with gorgeous old buildings and ivy has been taken over at every corner with high rises. In walking around, we saw a high-rise right next to a beautiful fraternity. The lawns are no longer sprawling. The bells of Altgeld are no longer playing. The beauty is gone. Enrollment has almost doubled since I attended and it has become apparent that the University is concerned more about $ than excellence and tradition. I really think the U of I spirit is disappearing. My sense is that in future years, alumni support will decrease.",

We visit every few years to check out the old stomping grounds and see what had changed. \\nAmidst all the financial scandals, the Lincoln theater does look quite impressive. Classes were in session so we couldn&apos;t see be main theater but the hall was quite nice. The little courtyards house the bricks bearing names of the donations. I was expecting a large wall with hundreds of donors but it looked a little sad seeing so few bricks engraved. I suspect they are hoping for the coming years to add to it, as the alumni list grows but from the looks for it, most of it was very old alumni and nothing newer than the class of 2007. \\nSome of the bricks looked unsteady on the bumpy ground. Hopefully no ones brick breaks. \\nThe quad looked dead in the freezing cold mid-April winter with empty trees but green grass. \\nThe foreign language building looked cool with a indoor courtyard, albeit an older building.\\nThe bell tower in the mathematics building was unfortunately closed. We missed the narrow window of 12:30-1 pm, for a tour. \\nParking was challenging even just to find a metered spot. \\nThe area around has grown quite a bit with big high rise apartments and a new Marriot (TownePlace suites) on Green and new restaurants, but all catered toward the college student.",

            "description": "I&apos;m writing this review as a UIUC graduate. I attended 2008-2012 and I received an undergraduate degree in biology. \\n\\nPositives:\\n\\n-The campus is really beautiful and generally visually appealing. The architecture is fantastic. As you walk around campus, it feels quintessential. It&apos;s especially college-looking in the fall. (You know, like all the brochures that get sent out.)\\n\\n-You are only required to live on campus freshmen year. This means I lived in an apartment off campus for three of my four years. It&apos;s much cheaper than on-campus housing with a meal plan. \\n\\n-You&apos;ll meet some of your best friends for life here. It&apos;s the Midwest. People are friendly. If you&apos;re from Illinois, I can guarantee that a chunk of your high school graduating class will end up here. When you meet someone, chances are you have some mutual friends or other connections. It&apos;s a small world for such a big school. \\n\\n-We host some pretty epic events here. Like Unofficial. I don&apos;t think I need to say anything more about that. \\n\\n-Your education is whatever you make of it. Some people go to every class, sit in the front row, study like crazy, revise papers, see professors during office hours, do undergrad research, etc. Other people slide by and only go to class when there&apos;s an exam. It is possible to get an A in a class you have never attended (obviously, it&apos;s only true of certain classes in certain disciplines). \\n\\n-We&apos;re a big school, so we get a lot more resources than smaller schools. \\n\\n-If you stay in IL after graduating, there are a lot of networking opportunities. Chicago is filled with U of I grads and many of them are keen on hiring other alumni. \\n\\n-There are tons of clubs, intramurals, and other student-led organizations to keep you busy here if you&apos;re so inclined. \\n\\nNegatives:\\n\\n-This school is expensive. I graduated almost three years ago and I&apos;m still swimming in debt. A lot of people have the impression that you&apos;ll save money by choosing to go to a public state school. It&apos;s really sobering to see the kind of debt I have even as an in-state student. If I had known this my senior year in high school, I would have done two years at community college and transferred instead to save money. \\n\\n-Greek life can somewhat overwhelm the social scene at times. To give you an idea, I was labeled as &quot;unaffiliated&quot; or as a &quot;GDI&quot; for not choosing to join a frat. If you want to go Greek, though, this would probably go as a positive.  \\n\\n-Urbana/Champaign has nothing going for it except for the university. Everything in the area caters to college students. There are perks to this, but sometimes you just want to be near a city to go out and DO things. No wonder drinking is so big here. Sometimes there isn&apos;t much else to do. \\n\\n-A lot of lab/research opportunities are for graduate students only.",

            "description": "Getting right to the point ...\\n\\nPros:  academically excellent, should be considered a Public Ivy, competitiveness brings out the best in you, once you scrape past the Greeks there are some intelligent individualistic students, a beautiful Quad, the Student Union, nice &quot;down home&quot; townies, students from rural towns / St Louis metro / Indy metro / out of state / out of the country are cool, cheap living, and lots of good eats on Green Street ... and actually all around &quot;Chambana.&quot;\\n\\nCons:  middle of nowhere, oppressive location, too far from a major city for road tripping and being able to manage a heavy academic workload, obnoxious Greeks, crappy weather most of the academic year (but the few weeks of peak color are beautiful), many North Shore students, Chicago meat heads, alcohol and sleazy places to drink it are many people&apos;s &quot;raison d&apos;etre,&quot; and occasional faculty members with their heads so far up their tenured asses that they aren&apos;t interested in teaching or making themselves accessible \\n\\nI am writing this review for the benefit of potential undergraduates from a distant out of state location and potential grad students as well.  For the undergrads, one review voiced that if you fall outside of traditional college demographics, this is NOT a fun place to go to school.  I could easily see that.  For graduate students, it isn&apos;t as diverse as one might expect of such a highly reputed school. The actual diversity is there, but the factions don&apos;t mix.  There is a very state-centric attitude and if you don&apos;t come from Chicagoland and don&apos;t plan to settle in Chicagoland upon finishing, &quot;those people,&quot; the bulk of U of I, can be somewhat dismissive.  Similarly, the alumni links are more tailgate worthy than they are for networking.  \\n\\nBottom line:  U of I can be enticing for its top of the heap rankings in engineering and accounting, among other fields, but it&apos;s not like all the available slots in those fields are only reserved for U of I grads.  If you are from Illinois and know &quot;the lay of the land&quot; then, sure, do take advantage of this bargain in public education, relatively speaking.  However, you can also find and consider other great public universities to put on your shopping list if from out of the region.",

Despite its high scholarship, the campus, overall, has a refreshingly unassuming tone. No pretension here.\\n\\nThe student body at this public university is massive, and as such you&apos;ll find a range of kids. At the time of this writing, the running count of registered student organizations (RSOs) topped 800! The Urbana-Champaign Hip Hop Congress may be one of my favorites. Each year they put on Hip Hop Awareness Week, which introduces the campus to the origins and history of the hip hop movement.\\n\\nIt would be difficult to capture the world that is Illinois in a Yelp review. But if you&apos;re ever in town during the semester, spend some time in the Illini (Student) Union to get an idea of what this place is all about.",

            "description": "UIUC is a damn good college. The engineering is world-class, we&apos;re the best party school according to some survey, we do a lot of research, all that stuff. It&apos;s a state school so it&apos;s not too expensive if you&apos;re an Illinoisan, which is a decent reparation for growing up in the least interesting region in the States.\\n\\nI got my bachelor&apos;s in CS here 2012-2016 and I can safely say that UIUC prepared me for a great career. For the most part, my classes were well-taught, gave me lots of valuable knowledge, and at least with the schedule I chose, I very rarely felt excessively stressed out. I had a full-time job offer (at Yelp!) months before I graduated, and all my other engineering friends were in the same boat. There are tons of career fairs here each semester and companies love to recruit from UIUC, so as long as you make an effort you have a very good chance of landing a full-time offer before graduation. Some of my friends had a full-time offer at the beginning of their senior years and another had one after he finished his sophomore year. Rest assured, if you&apos;re a fantastic student and do a good job of putting yourself out there, you will be employed.\\n\\nSome of the classes and professors I&apos;ve had were excellent. Special shoutouts to Eric Snodgrass of ATMS 120 fame, Jon Solomon in CLCV, and the entire Astronomy department. Of course I&apos;ve had some professors who weren&apos;t very good, but I&apos;d say that on the whole, the average UIUC professor is well above average. They&apos;re all very bright and qualified, but some just aren&apos;t as good at teaching as others. But not everyone can be perfect, right?\\n\\nOutside of academics, there&apos;s a decent amount to do. There are lots of clubs, which you can (and 100% should) check out on Quad Day at the beginning of each year. There are a ton of bars and restaurants in the area, and you&apos;re especially in luck if you like Chinese food. The age to enter bars is only 19, so even sophomores can have the true college experience (even though they can&apos;t legally drink). The Canopy Club on the East side of campus has had some reasonably big-name bands like the Chainsmokers, Madeon, and Porter Robinson, so keep an eye on who&apos;s coming next. There are some movie theaters nearby, a mall, and lots of Illini sports to watch, even if you don&apos;t like watching your football team suck for the umteenth year in a row. There are also nature trails nearby if you&apos;re into biking or jogging, though there isn&apos;t much in the way of scenery. Different school departments have events regularly, too. There are lots of plays and concerts in Krannert, there&apos;s the annual Engineering Open House, and the Astronomy department regularly opens up the old observatory on the south side of the Quad on clear nights for anyone to stargaze.\\n\\nUnfortunately, it&apos;s located in the middle of scenic nowhere, so no matter where you lived before coming here, you probably have to drive at least a couple hours to go home (or anywhere worth going, like Chicago or STL). Be prepared to stay close to campus all four years. Oh yeah, and the weather is pretty bad. It gets up into the 90s in the summer, drops down into the single-digits and negatives in the winter with a yearly paralyzing blizzard. There isn&apos;t much of a spring or fall. I also recently learned about &quot;corn sweat&quot;, which is a phenomenon wherein the massive amounts of corn in Central Illinois siphon water out of the ground and directly into the atmosphere, making some days unbearably humid in addition to their high temperatures. So be ready for that.\\n\\nSo, yeah. Great school. Would go again.",

I graduated when dinosaurs roamed the quadrangle and women had to be in their dorms tucked in by 10:30 pm on weekdays and 1 am on weekends.\\n\\nWhen I was at UIUC (and this is NOT a misprint), one semester&apos;s in-state tuition and fees were $135/semester.  It only cost about $1000-1200 per YEAR if you lived and ate in a university residence hall.\\n\\nAnd I remember some of the mouth watering meals they served like SOS (no, not the scouring pads), Salisbury steak with gook on it, many variations of mystery meat, turkey tetrazzini, and so on.\\n\\nFour semesters of ROTC and Physical Education were mandatory, wasting six hours&apos; perfectly good time every week - a time better spent sleeping, fooling around, drinking beer, or pursuing other intellectual interests.\\n\\nThe university was less selective in admissions at that time.  It would take almost all high school graduates who scored in the top half of their classes, and would take a few from the third quartile too.  Of course, then as now, they hired semi-literates to stock the football and basketball teams. The Daily Illini&apos;s Roger Ebert frequently wrote sarcastic articles about Dick Butkus, painting him as somebody who had no business taking up space there.\\n\\nIn reality, the students who were not in about the top quartile of their high school teams usually left the university by the end of their first year - so UIUC did graduate top-ranked students as they do today.  Indeed I had a roommate who flunked out in his senior year.\\n\\nI will tell you that UIUC had exceedingly high standards, and I did receive a rigorous and challenging education, which qualified me for admission to another Big Ten university&apos;s graduate school - and a subsequent career in engineering and eventually middle management in marketing.  Yes, marketing.\\n\\nThings do not change over time.  Freshmen got drunk at Kam&apos;s and puked all over the sidewalk.  Self-styled activists would try to save the world from all of its injustices - especially if a TV camera were focused on them, guys belched and farted, the passenger trains to/from Chicago were late, and a major objective of almost all students was to get laid.\\n\\nAll kidding aside, I am very proud of my experience and education at the U of I; and I will always be fond and grateful for my four years there.",

            "description": "For my 600th review, it seemed appropriate to write about the place that brought me to the scenic wonderland of the Midwest, The University of Illinois here in delightful Urbana-Champaign.\\n\\nFor a Southern California pseudo-hipster and person of color raised in Los Angeles and educated in San Diego, the U of I is a bit of a disorienting shock.  It&apos;s gigantic, yet full of personality and character.  It&apos;s also on some levels every stock stereotype about the &apos;college experience&apos;, from the pretentious architecture (that screams &quot;we look like an East Coast college!!!  Bricks!!  Yay!!!&quot;) to the terrifying/amazing/astounding/bizarrely huge percentage of students involved in a Greek life that resembles in almost creepy detail the stereotypical movie depictions of said groups, to the absolute obsession Illini sports engenders.\\n\\nI love a lot of it, with the fantastic resources, first class scholarship and immense potential.  I turned down Stanford and a few other &apos;name&apos; schools as I was amazed and remain constantly impressed by their history doctoral program, and I&apos;m thankful to be here for the education.  However, the location is a bit remote (although sometimes corn can be charming, I swear!), and there are some considerable issues here at U of I that have to be mentioned.\\n\\nWhile the U of I is definitely a brilliant academic institution and a great place for meaningful exchanges of ideas, diversity is weak here, and cultural understanding/communication is particularly weak.  The issues surrounding the infamous mascot linger on years after its supposed resolution, and to be a person of color in central Illinois is occasionally a difficult and daunting prospect indeed.  I&apos;ve been called the &apos;n&apos; word already, and it&apos;s a hard place to process when there are screaming groups of students that have been known to have &apos;tacos and tequila&apos; parties and still openly ask for the return of a racial caricature as a mascot.  It&apos;s daunting, but not insurmountable.\\n\\nMost of the students I&apos;ve met here are friendly, engaging, and generally cheerful.  They mean well, although it is *hard* to sometimes deal with racism either explicit or less intentional, honestly, and incidences like this year&apos;s vandalism of the Native American art exhibit outside the culture houses are emblematic of that.\\n\\nThat said, the school&apos;s trying.  The people of color are vibrant that are here, there is a good community, and it&apos;s growing.  I&apos;m thankful for that.  There&apos;s a strong organizing tradition here.  People *care* about things, and it&apos;s nice to see.\\n\\nA year after accepting their decision to come here, I don&apos;t regret it one bit, but Illinois is far from perfect or ideal.  It&apos;s a fantastic and wonderfully intellectually rigorous place, but it&apos;s also a daily challenge, particularly for us people of color who often have to fight to make our own spaces.  But I love it enough here to keep trying, and I certainly won&apos;t stop any time soon.\\n\\nBesides, I&apos;ve got at least another four years to go &apos;til I get to be Dr. Teej.",

It was the only college I applied to, and I miss my undergrad years there immensely. It was a time of great growth and experience, and it really is what you make of it. If you apply yourself and make an effort to reach out, have new experiences, and make new friends, you&apos;re going to have a great time. \\n\\nJoin a student organization, or better yet, start one. Find some ethnic cuisine you&apos;ve never tried before. Skip the campus bars every now and then and try out downtown Champaign. Pull an all-nighter in the UGL. Go to your professor&apos;s office hours for a change. Pick up some B movies at That&apos;s Rentertainment. Play intramural sports. Get a job at a dorm dining hall and make lifelong friends. Watch some kids play Dance Dance Revolution extremely well in the Illini Union. Read a book of poems on the Quad. \\n\\nI&apos;m not a frat bro. Nothing like one.

That&apos;s not what the movement is about. It is about shedding light on the racial and systemic injustices that our black communities and neighbors endure on a daily basis - it is meant to teach, to educate, to reform. If you are threatened or worried about something on a t-shirt, you&apos;re likely someone who needs to step back to reevaluate yourself and your privileges. Why are you upset that we care about our BIPOC and POC communities? Isn&apos;t that allowed? Should it be celebrated, especially with our youth?\\n\\nI would love, love, love a daycare and childcare center that taught children at a young age to practice love, empathy, and learning. Too bad this place isn&apos;t it! I&apos;m seeing so many reviews say things like how this childcare center is correct in how they acted because they should just let kids be kids. What? Why? You want to put blinders over your kids eyes to what is going on in the world? That&apos;s exactly how you create ignorant people. We should be teaching our children about what&apos;s going on - not hiding them from it. BLM isn&apos;t political. It&apos;s humanity. \\n\\nThis school deserves its one star and I hope that nobody sends their kids here. It seems they lack basic values of Christianity. What if I wore a shirt that said &quot;Breast Cancer Sucks.&quot; Is that a political view too? Does it mean that breast cancer is the only cancer that matters? What if it means something very personal to the child wearing it? would this center send the kid home for caring about a cause? Ridiculous.",

So before you take this too seriously, let me remind you that this is a Yelp review. That being said, I&apos;d love to come out of retirement for this review and talk about something that I&apos;ve cared so deeply about ever since I joined Greek Life, in the time before twitter. Lame ik.. \\n\\nFirst, I highly recommend going Greek no matter what your age is. But before you do, know that there is a standard you must meet. The school will tell you that you need a minimum GPA of 2.5 in college or in High School (if you&apos;re an incoming freshman). But lets be real, if you&apos;re coming out of HS with a GPA between a 2.5 &amp; 2.8 you need to seriously consider establishing a solid GPA for a semester or two before you join. Now for the part they won&apos;t talk about during recruitment.. You need to be a person of solid character and moral judgment. In life you&apos;re going to be put in awkward situations that you&apos;re not always going to have a good answer for. But you don&apos;t have to be a rocket scientist to know the difference between good and bad. You&apos;ll learn proper etiquette later and will mold in to the person you were meant to be as you get older. That&apos;s life. \\n\\nNow who doesn&apos;t love sorority rush?? I&apos;ll be quick and to the point. As a whole, sororities at ATU need to use more glitter and the Campus Rush video needs a serious overhaul. The music in the video is comparable to Nickelback playing at a Chuck E Cheese venue. (Cringe) Now I understand the school wants to come off as a safe and conservative place for students. But seriously? Ew. My experience with sororities has been excellent. Something about southern ladies helping the community and being leaders on campus is a thing of beauty. (To my knowledge the Panhellenic Council is a secret society of robe wearers who all carry gavels) Idk I&apos;ve never been to one of their meetings, it&apos;s just what I&apos;ve heard.\\n\\nFor the men in Greek Life, I&apos;ll make this super short and hopefully you&apos;ll get something out of it:\\nYou&apos;re born male, You grow in to a man, and you choose to be a gentleman. You can be cool and interact with everyone on campus without having to act insecure. Do that and you&apos;re college experience will be so much more bearable.\\n \\nNow for the PRO&apos;S: 1 Speaking from experience, Greek Life gives you a platform to meet and get out in front of new people.  2 You&apos;ll make a ton of new friends and make memories that will last a lifetime. Who knew this was possible in Russellville? 3 Opportunities to get involved are endless. You can literally do incredible things to help the community. 4 Mixers!! Need I say more? 5 Greek Week. This is hard to explain unless you&apos;ve been through it.\\n\\nAnd finally: The CON&apos;S : 1 The Link 2 Mandatory meetings and events 3 No Greek housing. Seriously Tech needs to get on this. It&apos;s kind of embarrassing and hard to justify all of the improvements on campus while not have Greek housing. 4 Student Services can be your best friend or worst nightmare. Elect intelligent and hard working leaders!! 5 Fines 6 Living in Russellville. \\n\\nI could go on all day. Seriously. (Willing to change my review to 5 stars pending I get my photo hung up and placed in Doc Bryan). @RiffRaffPayne",

She taught such an empowering curriculum that made me feel so confident in the choices I had made for my birth plan. I truly feel the education she gave us allowed me to advocate for the birth I wanted. She went above and beyond to provide information as different issues came up in my pregnancy, allowing me to make truly informed decisions that I was totally comfortable with.  At a week past my due date, the hospital forced me to schedule an induction and Lynette was the first person I contacted (after a good cry). She helped me to consider all my options and at the end of the day, helped me transfer care to a birth center that would honor my choice to wait as long as was medically safe for baby to come. She attended my birth as a student midwife, and was a strong steady presence through the transition and pushing phases of my labor.  She is calm and encouraging during birth and I felt safe and powerful as I brought my son into the world. I tell people giving birth is the most empowering thing I&apos;ve ever done, and Lynette was a big part of making that my reality. I&apos;m so thankful for her.",

            "description": "I&apos;ve gone through many home inspections and would not pay $500 (or a nickel) for Top-Notch Home inspectors to do my home inspection.\\n\\nYou are basically paying the owner Robbie to spend your money training his employees or students (rather than spending time with the homeowner).  \\n\\nI was at work and depended on him to give an accurate assessment of the inspection to my wife. BAD IDEA.  I would not leave my wife with him during an inspection again.  \\n\\nI  wouldn&apos;t mind him training his students but he didn&apos;t even go over major items found during the inspection.  At the inspection he said only little minor items found so we waived our inspection contingency based on what HE said but now is blaming us.\\n\\nNot until I looked in detail at the report did I discover major items that should have been brought up as red flags. For example, one of his documents noted &quot;acceptable water pressure&quot; to be between 40 to 90 psi. The reading he took a pic of for our house was barely 30psi. Also noted was water flow was very low and &quot;indications of a DEFECT in the water supply&quot;. Had I not analyzed the report, we would have never known. \\n\\nWe were left scrambling to figure out what to do since we waived our inspection and had no recourse with the seller for the defects before buying the house! We wasted our time and our realtor&apos;s time to get resolved.  \\n\\nWhen confronted, Robbie only gave us excuses and now is blaming us for the poor inspection. We waived our inspection contingency because of what HE told us, let&apos;s get that clear.  \\n\\nContrary to what Robbie says, my concern for low water pressure and water flow is NOT a personal preference or an opinion. It was way below the standard MINIMUM ACCEPTABLE industry range (even says that in his own documents). When confronted, he even said that was way too low for his home and had to fix. Now he says it&apos;s beyond his legal requirement as a home inspector to tell me.  \\n\\n&quot;indications of a defect in the water system&quot;  his company&apos;s words in the inspection report. \\n\\nWhy would you not mention during or after the inspection and leave it to homeowner to find out. Because they were wrapping up to go to their next inspection is what he told me the reason he said only minor issues found and it&apos;s up to us to let them know we wanted them to spend more time with us to cover the issues. How are we supposed to know?",

            "description": "Top Notch Home Inspection inspected my home in Toledo, WA, on Sept 2, 2022 and extensively damaged my garage door, by not following manufacturers guidelines for testing the safety reverse function.  Worse, Top Notch has not taken responsibility for the damage they caused.  \\nIn testing the reverse function of the opener, the Top Notch Inspector lowered the door and, while the door was coming down, &quot;tested&quot; the reverse function by attempting to stop the door when it reached his waist level (the inspector is a large, strong man) from descending further by using what appeared to be all of his arm, shoulder and body strength.  He applied considerable force to stop the movement of the metal panel door.  I directly observed he even attempted to reverse the downward momentum of the door&apos;s direction by pulling/pushing up on the door, against its downward motion.  The door temporarily halted, grinded and then, after &quot;maximum&quot; force was applied and then released, grinded downward.\\n\\nThe very next time I opened the door, it rose approximately one third of the way, then it shook, ground, vibrated violently, twisting in the roller frame, the garage door window shattered, spewing glass all over the garage and stopped.  The top frame, where the opener operator arm attaches to door, had buckled, causing the warping/torquing of door in the frame, and causing the window glass to break.   Previous to Top Notch&apos;s &quot;test,&quot; the door operated flawlessly.\\n  \\nGarage Door Opener Manufacturer guidance for testing the reverse function is explicit and clear:  you place a 2x4&quot; board flat on the ground and allow the door to descend, strike the board and reverse.  You do not &quot;yard&quot; on the door as it is descending.  Manufacturers adamantly warn against this maneuver, saying it is both dangerous and will often result in over-torquing metal panel doors, resulting in extensive damage.\\n  \\nI spent considerable time cleaning up the mess from the breakage, making temporary repairs to the garage door, replacing the glass, obtaining estimates and filing extensive paperwork with Top Notch&apos;s Insurance Company, where my claim has now idled five weeks with no action taken.  This insurance diversion tactic is a way some unscrupulous companies use to get the claim out of mind and out of sight, where the insurance company will ultimately find a way to deny it.  Meanwhile, the homeowner has to absorb the costs of thousands of dollars of damage to his/her property caused by, in this case, inspector negligence.\\n   \\nI deeply regret allowing Top Notch into my home and will never do so again.  Addressing the damage thus far has cost me weeks of my life, with more to come.  It&apos;s ironic that Top Notch is also a Home Inspection School, teaching new inspectors the &quot;correct&quot; way to inspect homes.  Mistakes are sometimes made, but reputable companies will assume responsibility for them and indemnify those affected.  Not this company.   It has been nothing but a protracted stonewalling and avoidance maneuver with refusal to correct a glaring error.  Realtors that commission home inspections may also share in liability for inspector negligence that leads to substantial, unresolved damage.",
