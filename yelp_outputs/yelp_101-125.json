We got a message saying the night we booked did not look so good so we pushed it to the next night. The weather was better for seeing and we had a great time. You let them know what hotel you are at and they will tell you want time that they are picking you up. They take you to two locations to see the aurora and teach you how to setup your camera or phone. This is very helpful as we never used the night functions on the camera or phone before and to get the best shots you need to have the correct settings. They provide a tripod if you do not have one. They also take a group shot of your party if you want so you have professional photos with your group with the aurora in the background. They also provide some snacks and hot drinks.

We did not go home disappointed. While the chances of seeing the aurora was almost slim to none due to the brightness of the moon in February, Jody, our wonderful tour-guide remained patient and took us to two different locations to maximize our chances. We started the tour around 10PM and continued the search until about 2AM when finally the northern lights decided to let us have a glimpse (maybe for about 10 minutes?). As it was just me and my husband and one other person on the tour, Jody was able to snap a good amount of photos of me and my husband with the aurora in the background--seriously, the best part about this tour. We came home to Chicago and our inbox was filled with beautiful photos from that night taken by Jody. We can&apos;t thank her enough for making this happen and taking the photos to document this very special moment for us.\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":5,\"reviewCount\":4}}"]},

Their bikes are in great shape and had no issues during the course. I even witnessed them moving riders around to find the best fit for them, clearly focused on rider success.

During the exercises, there were no dumb questions - which fostered a uniquely inclusive culture between the participants. \\n\\nIf riders struggled, they were quick to help, not quick to talk down on. If some required 1:1 or 1:few assistance, that was done without hesitation. Russ and Chuck were somehow able to make every rider feel like the strongest one in the group, without instilling over confidence and negating to point out areas of improvement. \\n\\nIf you are considering an MSF course, and are looking in the upstate, you are doing a great disservice to yourself by not looking at Upstate Rider Training.

I spoke with a very friendly teacher that told me the director was out. I asked when I could stop by and she said ANYTIME. I went that afternoon and the afternoon assistant knew I was going to be stopping by. She took us on a tour and was very friendly. She gave me the information. I spoke with the director the next day and she was aware of me coming by and calling. My son started the next week! They truly care about him. The staff communicates and everyone seems to know what is going on. I&apos;m not sure how, but his teacher has taught him colors and shapes and several numbers in his three months there (he turned 2 in August)! His speech is more clear, his attitude and personality have also further developed. There is just a wonderful feeling at NALC. It&apos;s clean. It&apos;s secure. It&apos;s a fun environment. And each teacher really cares about their kids. I love that other teachers know my son&apos;s name and he tells them hey and bye and waves at them. NALC is much more than just a &quot;daycare.&quot; They do take the time to educate children. Price is extremely reasonable. And they communicate with parents so much better than I ever thought.

I had filled out a parent form and was returning it to the teacher, she had it in her hand, another child snatched the paper from her hands, she went to snatch it back and he went with the paper and hit his head on the cabinet. He whined, and she says &quot;You&apos;re fine. Get up&quot;. I was shocked.\\n\\n-I went in to pay our dues on my lunch break one day at 2:30 in the afternoon. I walked in the front door, no one was in the lobby, no one was in the play room(lights off) no adult in sight except teachers in the classroom, I went and stood at my child&apos;s class door for about 15 minutes, watching. Finally when I walked back to the front, the front desk lady walks out from kitchen(on her lunch)... Doors were unlockedand no one watching the front to see who enters or leaves. With today&apos;s society, intruders are common... saftey procaution not taken. Unsettling.\\n\\n-New Generation assured me when my child started that they check the list to see who is allowed to pick up child, check their ID&apos;s, and are to be signed in &amp; out each day. My child&apos;s aunt was picking him up for the first time, no one was at the front desk once again, but the owner was playing her her grandchildren in the floor not acknowledging she was there. I told her how to get to my child&apos;s class. No one was there to tell her to sign my child out, no one checked the list OR her ID, when she walked to the room  to get my child, (my child is too young to speak), the teacher asked her if she was there to pick up my child, she said yes and began to pull out her ID, the teacher says &quot;I don&apos;t need to see that, he wouldn&apos;t have came to you if he didnt know you&quot; (My child is friendly and goes to anyone)...So they will let anyone pick up my child just because they say they are???\\n\\n-Paperwork I filled out for registration, under allergies, I put &quot;NO JUICE&quot; hes allergic to juice. My child&apos;s bottom turns red, blisters, and will bleed...my child&apos;s stools are liquid, and seems to upset his belly. Inside my child&apos;s cubby at New Generation, on a paper in the back of it, in bold letters, says &quot;NO JUICE&quot;. During my child&apos;s school Christmas party I came, my child was just finishing a bottle of NON diluted Apple Juice. By the time we got home, bottom was blistered, raw, and bleeding. I was so upset. I messaged my child&apos;s teacher and said &quot;If you don&apos;t mind, NO more juice please&quot;... she replies with &quot;I&apos;m sorry, I forgot&quot;...\\n\\n- Floors are disgusting, smells like pee, my childs socks were completely black on bottom from running about 5 yards across the floor at Christmas party while I was changing my child&apos;s diaper, putting his shoes and clothes back on . I asked if they shampoo the carpet. Teacher says &quot;No just vaccuum and sweep.&quot; She also agreed that they were nasty. Filthy enviornment, in and out of the ER &amp; hospital every other week. I understand kids get sick, but not cleaning an enviornment that toddlers are in can make sickness worse.\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":1,\"reviewCount\":1}}"]},

The building itself is located at the south end of the University Center, a strange place for a college campus since I remember this place as a kid in the 80&apos;s with a movie theater, Waldenbooks, a huge video game arcade lined up next to the theater, and a hot dog place down the hall. The wide hallways where stores like Musicland and other shops resided 20 years ago are now replaced with chairs and tables on both sides of the hallway for studying on your laptop or reading textbooks. A campus convenience store that sells snacks, espresso drinks, and UAA t-shirts is located at the old Round Table Pizza location. This campus is convenient to the Pepperoncini Deli next door where I go to have lunch from time to time and they will give discounts for any students who come in with the proper student ID. \\nThe layout is spacious and wide open. Concentrating on studying is no issue with this place as the atmosphere is very quiet and relaxing with only a few students, school personnel, and people doing walking exercises roaming the hallways. It is never crowded and I like the fact that the Wi-Fi is strong and fast everywhere on campus. The school has also provided countless computer stations for students who don&apos;t have laptops. The reason I put this at three stars rather than four is the indifference and aloofness of some of the staff there if you have any questions. A couple of the staff members may be visibly impatient or annoyed if you have questions on how to register properly at the Pearson Center for testing or at the main info desk as if students should already know what to do even if it&apos;s their first time there.\\nAside from that, they have a spacious testing center that isn&apos;t cramped with a decent amount of personal space for students. Lockers for personal items like cell phones, wallets, watches, or school papers are provided at the sign-in desk as none of these are allowed into the center that would help you in any way when taking a test. Available classrooms on campus are plentiful and I have never seen those rooms crowded like the main campus whenever I&apos;m here. There is never an issue with parking and this is another good option for studying if the coffee shops I go to are packed with no place to sit.\"},{\"author\":\"K.

I took my 9 year old son there for an assessment. While he was testing I had the opportunity to listen (because he is very loud, and never shut the door) to him talking to another parent and child. The way he describes things is very &quot;dumbed down&quot; almost like he thinks people other than him won&apos;t understand what he is trying to say. I also heard him tell a child that &quot;if they are bad, he puts them in a room in the back and locks the door and turns off the light&quot;. Of course he said he was kidding, but something in his demeanor maybe question if he really was. Nonetheless, I went back the following week to get my sons test scores. I had to bring my two year old daughter because she had a doctor appointment immediately prior. My 9 year old son was with me ( who is autistic) and at my request was trying to help watch his sister while Isaac was &quot;dumbing down&quot; my child&apos;s test results. After about 5 minutes of us being there, my daughter (2) had found the candy machine. My son was standing by her and trying to keep her hands off it. Apparently this was annoying Isaac, who in front of everyone on the center, yelled very loudly and aggressively at my children and said &quot; YOU AND HER GO SIT DOWN! THAT&apos;S A $300 MACHINE!&quot;  \\n\\nI simply grabbed my keys, wallet and phone and took my kids by the hand and walked out. Right in the middle of our meeting.
