Ms Breanna, Ms Leslie, Ms Rachel, Ms Alysse etc. In half day program they also offer lunch and healthy snacks which is great.\\nMy oldest daughter started when she was 2.5 yo and my youngest started at the Infant day care program 16mo, since the first day that I left her at the CCDS I felt safe and knew she was in the best hands. \\nI have a very good experience even during covid-19 difficult time they managed to stay open and that was amazing.The staff is great, all friendly, polite and willing to help you. The only annoying part is that they do a lot of % increases in the tuition fees, which sometimes doesn&apos;t really make sense. Other than that, I give 5 stars and more, my daughters learned so many things and they were always happy during drop off and pick up time.

Not because Yelp contacted me that someone is requesting to have it removed but because Yelp contacted me that someone was requesting it be removed and that upset me. So I went to my training session frustrated and my trainer encouraged me to take that negative energy and turn it into positive energy. So here is my effort to do so. \\n\\nI&apos;m giving CCDS a one star because I believe this is not a healthy environment for children to learn and be supported developmentally.  As a parent whose child attended CCDS my 2 year old was restrained to a chair because after he finished snack he wanted to go play.  I saw this on camera and recorded the incident. I then immediately called the school and spoke to Ms Alize. She said she was told it was school policy to make kids at the age of two sit at the table until their friends finish snack. I told her that was NOT a developmentally appropriate practice and that I would speak to Melissa the administrator about the incident. \\n\\nI spoke to Melissa and she went to watch her video recording called me back and admitted that she saw the incident. She also said she would talk to Ms Alize. Unfortunately during the conversation I raised other concerns regarding the aggressive handling of the children at nap time, them not providing AM snacks and the overally structured learning environment. Melissa explained to me this is how she has done it for 20 years. I assured her if she is doing things from 20 years ago she has a lot to catch up on cause research shows that is not a conducive learning environment. She then said she does what works for her. I encouraged her to do what is right for the children and families. She then said maybe this is not a place for me and my child and threatened to disenroll my child. I then informed her about Title 22 regulations which do not allow that. But after seeing we had to very different philosophies I agreed that this was not a place I wanted my child. \\n\\nMelissa then refunded ALL my money. \\n\\nBecause I am a mandated reporter I had to report the violation to my sons rights so I did. I notified CCLD and an investigation took place. Melissa denied the incident. \\n\\nI was very angry about the denial of what happened to my son and even more worried for no plan of correction. \\n\\nHere is the positivity... I wish Melissa and all the staff at CCDS to find it in their heart to do right by our kids. My hope is that they will find it in their heart to get properly  trained to better understand kids and how to care for and educate them in loving and inspiring ways.  I forgive Melissa and Ms. Alize and Ms. Stephanie who stood by and watched. I forgive those ladies for what you did to my son.

She was there from March 2017 - May 2019. She was in Ms. Lupe and Ms. Mariel&apos;s Spanish immersion preschool class. Before deciding to move out state we planned for her to be at CCDS through kindergarten. \\n\\nWe could not be happier with our experience at the school. The peace of mind we had as parents dropping her off each day and the love our daughter had for the school was priceless. The love and care her teachers provided was incredible to see. The environment at school feels like family. \\n\\nTuition includes breakfast, lunch and two snacks. You never have to stress about bringing food to school. The meal plan for lunches is unlike anything I&apos;ve ever seen. Definitely not your standard kids menu offerings. There&apos;s an on-site chef who prepares their meals each day. \\n\\nAnother awesome feature at the school is the webcams. You can log in it at anytime and watch what your child is up to from your computer or mobile device. It was especially great in the beginning when  we were leaving her with someone we didn&apos;t know for the first time. Then was just fun to sometimes peak in and see her in her school environment. \\n\\nThe last thing I will highlight is the parent/family involvement. They offer a monthly parents night out at a far less expensive rate than a babysitter and your child gets to be with their friends in a familiar environment. There&apos;s a bowling tournament for parents twice a year, a father/daughter dance, another one for mother/son and other fun events. They also have a spring and winter festival where the children perform. \\n\\nCCDS is really something special. The campus is immaculate. Everyone is so friendly/helpful, they really take pride in their work. Yes the tuition is on the higher side but it&apos;s worth every penny. You absolutely get what you pay for. A huge thank you to Ms. Melissa the director, Ms. Bailey and Ms. Nely the assistant directors. I cannot imagine all the work it takes to keep the school operating as it does... flawlessly! Ms. Lupe and Ms. Mariel, thank you for loving Miss V as your own. We will miss you both so much. Last but certainly not least Ms. Laura in the infant/toddler room.

And our son LOVES it. We couldn&apos;t be happier with our choice. CCDS stood out for us for us in our daycare selection because of their curriculum. We seriously lucked out to have such great teachers as well! Miss Melissa would give me daily updates on how our son was feeling/eating/sleeping etc. and really take the time to reassure me of whatever new mom worry I had. Even in the infant area, they have structured reading/activities time which is amazing.

For a while she was the only one who could console him if something was wrong. Luckily he has opened up quite a bit! The curriculum on the toddler side is even better, jam packed with activities and outdoor play and set snack/meal times as well as a two hour nap midday. They track our son&apos;s milestones as well. They caught his first series of steps on camera for me and we get monthly updates on his progress at school. In the meantime CCDS has great perks for families as well.

My instructor was Lauren (LuLu). I can honestly say she is a great instructor. Our class was considered too big to stay together for clinicals, so we were split into groups of 13 at two different facilities. My group ended up staying with Lauren, and the other with Donna. Very fast-paced. Theory for about 2 weeks, then clinicals for the remaining time. Lauren was very helpful throughout my time there. She is very smart, and answered every question thoroughly and explained it well. She was very hands on at the facility and was always there to offer help. Every time we&apos;d be nervous, she would reassure us that it would be okay, and it always was. I would highly recommend this program, and Lauren. She made our time there fun, and I ultimately had a great experience because of her. She has a passion for helping others, and has a great personality to go along with it. Highly recommend!\\nCPR: I took the CPR class with Chuck on a Saturday. He charges a really great (low) price, and the class was only 3.5 hours! I highly recommend him if you need to be CPR certified or want to renew. He is very knowledgable. He explained thoroughly why CPR works the way it does and how it works.

So when I decided to change the course of my life and start working towards a career in the Healthcare industry, I was overwhelmed with how to start. With so many choices to choose from, I had no idea how I was ever going to get started. I knew I wanted to be a PA (Physician&apos;s Assistant) but that would take me at least 5 years minimum. I wanted to start working in a hospital setting immediately so I could have all that experience by the time I got my PA license and have many connections forged. \\n\\nI decided becoming a CNA was the best way to get my foot in the door. Now that I had that figured out, the next step was figuring out how and where I would take my classes. The first choice I had was taking courses at Mira Costa College. The downside to this was in order to even get into the program, I had to go on a wait-list that could take up to a YEAR! Even if I were to wait, I&apos;d have to make sure I had the prerequisite classes completed as well. PASS.\\n\\nNext up was Kaplan College. I took a tour of this school, and the lady that helped me was very nice. The program setup was really cool, as they teach you how not only to be a CNA but give you phlebotomy and EKG classes as well. This is good in the search for a job as it gives you way more positions to apply for and like they say, &quot;The more you can do, the better.&quot; The downside to this option was THE PRICE! Their courses cost almost 2-3 times the amount they would at Mira Costa. You would either need loads of money or financial aid for your financial aid. PASS.\\n\\nOne day, I was online looking for jobs and happened across a listing saying &quot;GET YOUR CNA LICENSE IN 21 DAYS!&quot; Immediately, I clicked the link and saw information on Healthcare Academy of California. Obviously, I was skeptical. My first thought was SCAM! So I did my research and checked Yelp. The reviews were very positive but not enough to fully convince me, so I checked Facebook and saw more positive reviews. I knew these would be hard to fake since it would take lots of time to create multiple fake accounts. I even went so far as to message one of their former students and asked about her experience. She wrote me back and had positive things to say. Next, I decided to give them a call and spoke with Janet. She was so pleasant on the phone and answered all my questions. Tuition was more than fair and covered everything from books, to BLS certification, to scrubs and state exam fees. The classes were M-F 10a-6:30p or you could do an 11wk weekend course from 8a-4:30p. The classes were taught by an actual RN and depending on which course you took, this would determine which teacher you&apos;d get. \\n\\nWith all my information I had gathered, I pulled the trigger on Healthcare Academy of California and enrolled. They offer payment plans so you can break up tuition over 3 payments. Very cool. Janet gave me a tour of the classroom and they have a room that dubs as a mock hospital room with a dummy and all the supplies one would find in a hospital setting. \\n\\nNow I&apos;m currently a student and approaching the end of my 21 day certification and I can EASILY say this program was the best choice not only for money and time but for the instructor as well. His name is Greg and he is a RN and makes the learning fun and easy. There is a heavy workload of homework but that&apos;s too be expected since it&apos;s an accelerated course. Luckily they give you plenty of time to work on your homework in class so you shouldn&apos;t have any issues not completing the assignments.  There is a test every class that covers the chapters went over in class the day before, so make sure you do the homework and you should ace them. Greg knows his stuff and if you follow his instructions, you should have no problem getting the 21 required skills down pat. Clinicals are held at an old folks home and this is probably the hardest part of the whole course. I don&apos;t personally like working there and don&apos;t want to work there post graduation, but I know they are the ones who hire new grads. That being said, Greg will pair you with a CNA and you will shadow them and apply your knowledge in real life sensations. \\n\\nAll in all, I cannot say enough good things about this school. Even CNAs who went to Kaplan and Mira Costa said they wished they would&apos;ve went thru HAC because of the reasons above. If you&apos;re looking for a change and want to join the Healthcare field, this is the best place to start. Make your first step the easiest part of your journey and join Healthcare Academy of California and take Greg&apos;s classes. You won&apos;t regret it.\"},{\"author\":\"Octavia M.\",\"datePublished\":\"2017-02-12\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"Highly recommend!

Our son has been coming here for a couple of months now, and has been working on his interpersonal and social skills through the PEERS program, as well as continuing that training in the less formal LEGO club.\\n\\nEach program is designed to aid children who need assistance in developing and growing their social skills, and our son has been making leaps and bounds since starting here! Our son has Asperger&apos;s syndrome, and Anna has been wonderful in working with him. We did all of our homework, and her credentials all check out (which is something that we always do before working with a service provider.)\\n\\nBoth of our boys come for LEGO club, and both of them look forward to it each week, even though we get up fairly early each Saturday to get there. LEGO club proved to be an excellent starting point for the boys, and allowed them to really grow comfortable in the setting before we got the PEERS program set up for our eldest. \\n\\nNow, to the details: the facility is absolutely beautiful. Build inside a dual use location in Carlsbad, the downstairs is set up for the program. Tastefully decorated, it is fun, light, and airy, with plenty of slightly subdued colors that look delightful without being overwhelming. There are plenty of toys, and the collection of LEGO&apos;s is constantly expanding. There is a good mix of special needs and typical children, which allows for real interactions that are all supervised and directed by Anna and her staff.

As someone who&apos;s always been a terrible singer, I learned so many things during my lessons and I am a MUCH more confident singer than I am before. I&apos;m never going to be singing on Broadway, but I highly recommend lessons even if you have no intention of ever becoming a singer or even doing a live performance. Besides being really fun, I use to feel shy about singing in the car or trying to sing someone a song that I forgot the name of the song, but the lessons has given me confidence to be more expressive with my voice. I loved that Jiyoung challenged me and pushed me to improve my vocal technique. \\nSecondly, I found the CML billing platform very easy to use. They billed me via e-mail every month and it was simply a few clicks to pay and they sent a detailed invoice with every payment that was easy to save.\\nI can&apos;t speak on the other teachers, but for voice lessons Jiyoung is great. I will note though, that you can&apos;t just take lessons once a week and expect to improve much. Yes, just learning better technique can already dramatically improve your singing, but it also takes a lot of your own time and practice.

The school is run by Mrs. Manika who has taken pain staking care to ensure that the children receive an excellent education with authentic Montessori materials, while nurturing and loving them.  As mentioned, the school is run in Mrs. Manika&apos;s home.  She has converted her living and dining rooms into a traditional Montessori classroom with all high quality materials displayed on shelves placed at the children&apos;s level for easy access.  She also has a small playground area in her backyard for the children to play on, and the children eat snacks and lunch together at their child size table taking turns serving each other and practicing their manners.\\n\\nDuring the school year, Mrs. Manika hosts a winter celebration and a graduation party for families, where the children proudly perform songs and skits they have practiced, and share projects that they have made.  She also plans several field trips each year, which the children always enjoy and look forward to.  Over the years we have been to the pumpkin patch, the flower fields, the aquarium, and the Wild Animal Park to name a few. \\n\\nShalini is a caring and loving teacher who nurtures her students.  She not only guides the children to learn the normal preschool fundamentals, but also fosters compassion, acceptance, self-discipline, respect for others and self confidence in her students.

I also like that she holds parent-teacher conferences each year after the winter break where we can discuss in detail my son&apos;s progress, and she has even upon my request, shared suggestions to help my child grow not only in his education, but also emotionally and psychologically.

My son was eager to begin school after having his last school cut short, due to the pandemic. The director was seemingly pleasant when we met her &amp; the school had reasonable rates for what it was. My son was in the &quot;TK&quot; class.\\nWe realized soon after starting that a couple of moms in the class had it out for our son. He was a little too rambunctious for these kid&apos;s mom&apos;s and we realized later, that he was being bullied. Always labeled &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;naughty&quot; by the kids in his class &amp; he was always getting tattled on for anything he did. Naturally, my son began to act out; there were a couple of incidents that were normal playground type behavior, but we felt there was something more going on. We asked his teacher almost daily how he was doing, was anything going on, etc. and she would always say, &quot;i&apos;ll let you know if anything happens, he is totally fine. There is NOTHING to worry about. He&apos;s just being a normal 5 year old boy.&quot; Her words. Also, she let us know in a meeting we had with her later that she never uses the words &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;naughty&quot; in her classroom &amp; that those names must be coming from somewhere else (ahem, other kid&apos;s parents). Judging by my son&apos;s behavior at home, at how he used to cry at night before school, we knew there was something going on. I mean how, in a classroom of 10 kids with 2 teachers can you not realize what is happening??\\nAbout to get to the worst part about this school- THEY HAVE A 3 STRIKES POLICY FOR PRESCHOOLERS.\\nWe didn&apos;t realize this so called policy even existed until later- when we wanted to pull him out of this terrible place. There is nothing in the parent handbook, school policies, etc. It sounds like it was almost made up, so that they could push us out. We even had a sit down meeting with his teacher face to face, where she told us he was a perfectly normal 5 year old kid &amp; he&apos;s just learning- like the rest of the class. She wanted to make us feel like he wasn&apos;t a bad kid &amp; that she had his back.  She made zero mention about him having had 2 strikes at this point.\\nAlso during these incidents, my son was sent to the Director&apos;s office without notifying us first. Can the teacher&apos;s not handle the incident themselves?? That should have been a red flag.\\nIt seems that Redeemer is more worried about the opinions of overbearing &amp; non empathetic parents rather than trying to help &amp; improve the child.  There should have been some type of plan for my son, but I guess they lack the resources &amp; education on this front.\\nHad they wanted him to stay, they would have created a plan or let us in our their secret &apos;policy&apos; that he was almost at 3 strikes and that maybe we should consider looking at different schools/options we may have.\\nI only hope I can warn other parents in the area that if they have a typical 5 year old boy who is a bit active, they should probably steer clear of Redeemer.  As a Christian school, I would have thought they would have more empathy.\\nI was hopeful this school would provide the nurturing care that my son needed to grow academically, socially and emotionally. In taking the actions they have, they have failed him.\\nPartnerships between parents and teachers are imperative to a child&apos;s total growth.

The teachers are wonderful (hence the 2 and not 1 star). They really are the stars of the show. My kids were very ready for kindergarten and I attribute that to the teachers!\\n\\nMy problem is with the administration. Since coming to this school, I have been through two previous directors before the current director. The previous directors were great, always available, and open to suggestions and ideas. I do recognize the uphill battle this director has had to endure with COVID and all of the precautions they are required to take.\\n\\nBUT......They didn&apos;t require masks. They followed OSHA, etc and their recommendations. These websites did recommend that they &quot;try&quot; to enforce mask-wearing, which was not done at all. It seems they took what they wanted from these sites and claimed that three year olds would not be able to wear masks.\\n\\nWhen I pressed for an answer as to why they couldn&apos;t just mandate masks on their own, I was either ignored or sent a copy and pasted answer that didn&apos;t answer my concerns. They could not answer why they just simply couldn&apos;t mandate masks. It is not that hard to make that decision for your own school when it is proven to help prevent the spread. Why would you not do all you can to protect these kids?\\n\\nI unfortunately had to pull my two kids because I felt like they were not doing everything in their power to keep them safe. On top of this, I was being ignored and dismissed with all of my concerns. I would have been happy to open a discussion, but this was never offered. Something the administration should always be available to do.\\n\\nAgain, I do love the teachers and curriculum, and after all of this, they eventually enforced mask-wearing (yay!).

Two months after our 3 year old daughter started at Redeemer, she was diagnosed with cancer, and had to stay home for treatment the rest of the school year. By that point, she was already attached to her teachers and classmates, several of whom she knew even before starting there. Seven days after her diagnosis, I specifically emailed the director asking that her spot be saved for her, as we were going to fight as hard as we could for her to get better, and return to her class. By the spring, I realized I hadn&apos;t heard from the school about fall enrollment, and when I emailed the director, she said our daughter&apos;s spot was taken and she could be put on a waitlist. Our then- four year old daughter had fought hard and bravely to be able to return to normal life and her class- she would have been devastated to not return to her teachers and friends- and after a lengthy email and offer to go to the local news with our story, her spot fortuitously opened up. After her treatment was done, we also heard from several parents in the school that they had tried to plan fundraisers and other events for our daughter, but all of those ideas were shot down by the director. All of her teachers there were good teachers, in fairness, but hopefully your child won&apos;t get a life-threatening illness while at Redeemer, because our experience with a supposed Christian school is that you will get no support at all.\"},{\"author\":\"Christine S.\",\"datePublished\":\"2016-11-23\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":4},\"description\":\"Well balanced preschool program that focuses on the whole child.\\nI&apos;ve visited a number of preschools in the area, including one down the street which we loved, so I can say that this is a really great place for kids.\\n\\nIt is more structured than other preschools in some regards, and has a stronger academic focus.

We signed up our daughter after being on the waitlist, and paid a non-refundable deposit for tuition, supplies and registration fee. You have no choice but to sign this as you sign up. A couple months later, we got a diagnosis our daughter had a special need and needed therapy, but the only time to do that was during the time we had class at Redeemer. The other option Redeemer gave us was in the afternoon sessions which didn&apos;t work for us, since we work. We withdrew 2+ months before school began and they replaced her spot but refused to give us back our deposit, even after we laid out the circumstance to them. \\n\\nWe had to take them to court to try to recover it. The judge ruled that even though it&apos;s bad business for them to do this and a bad way to treat families of those you&apos;re supposed to be helping, they could keep the nearly $500 because they offered us an option B (an option which didn&apos;t work for us).  This, also despite the fact that the CA Supreme Court has ruled non-refundable deposits ARE refundable if a replacement &quot;buyer&quot; (student) is found. They can&apos;t legally enrich themselves over our unfortunate circumstance, but they--a church preschool--opted to do that. \\n\\nWe are very frustrated, and not the first family to deal with this. Be wary of what you sign, and the fact that Redeemer&apos;s people don&apos;t necessarily have your best interests in mind, even when it comes to an unforeseen circumstance surrounding a 3-year-old.\"},{\"author\":\"Cara M.\",\"datePublished\":\"2019-09-30\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"Love this school.

I chose afternoon because of the smaller class size since this was his first time in a school environment. In August when he started, the class had 8 children. After fall break, we came back to a full class of 15. This really had an effect on my son in a negative way. He no longer wanted to go to school. I think a big part of this was the noise. the class became VERY Noisy and he just didn&apos;t seem to like it.  it got to the point where it was a constant battle trying to get him in the car. He would scream and cry and kick etc. I contacted the school several times regarding this asking for advice. I spoke to his teacher a few times and the director a few times. In late February I spoke to the director again, at which point we both agreed to pull him out for the remainder of the year and try again the next fall. This was at the same time that the fall registration was due. We didn&apos;t want to lose his spot for next year but we were also struggling with what to do. We ended up submitted the $625 fee and registration a day late, which they were not pleased about.\\n\\n During his &quot;break&quot; I contacted my older sons former Preschool teacher to see if we could go and &quot;visit&quot; her school.( I would have chosen her school to begin with but we moved and she was much farther away. ) She has a very quiet preschool of 6 kids. he loved it from the minute we went to visit. She happened to have an open spot during the afternoons for the rest of the school year so we decided to enroll him through June.\\n\\nSeeing how much he enjoyed going to the new school, we decided to keep him there for next year and let Reedemer know that he would not be attending the next school year (which starts in August 2017) I then asked for our deposit back. ( $175 was the supply and registration fee and $450 was the cost of tuition for the month of June 2018. June 2018 is a full 15 months away! \\n\\nThey replied that I would not be getting any of my $625.00 back.\\n\\n I understand keeping the deposit and supply fee of $175 since we were &quot;holding his spot&quot; BUT I do not understand nor agree with them keeping the $450 tuition fee for a tuition that will occur 15 months from now.  When I brought this to their attention, they ignored my email for several weeks.\\n\\nYes, I signed a contract and i understand that. However, They made ZERO effort to work with us. Especially knowing we were having problems prior.\\n\\nIt gets better! \\n\\nToday i finally received a response. They had the nerve to state that I actually owed them March tuition of $280 AND a late fee of $25.00!. When I spoke to The director in February and she agreed that I should pull my son out, there was NO mention of owing  March tuition.  On March 7th, i was asked to send an email back stating my intentions to pull my son out for the remainder of the year for their records, with again, no mention of March tuition. I sent my intentions email on March 8th. \\n\\nHere was part of their response that I received today:\\n\\n&quot;Based on this information, the required 30 days written notice per your signed agreement ended on March 24th, therefore, the March tuition in the amount of $280 was due by March 5th.  It was not received by that date and a late fee of $25 was added for a total of $305 and as of this date, remains unpaid.&quot; \\n\\nI signed that agreement 10 months ago. it&apos;s amazing I didn&apos;t remember the part about the written notice! \\n\\nPlease note, my son did not attend a single day in March, which they were aware of in February.  \\n\\nOne more thing I wanted to add:\\n\\nIn our conversations, they thought a part of the reason for this behavior was because I was giving in to his tantrums of not wanting to go to school.  Honestly, a few times, yes. I felt bad that he screamed and cried about going. I wanted him to want to go to school. I didn&apos;t want this to be a punishment or a negative experience. They made me feel like I was not being a good mom and that he was throwing the tantrums because he knew he would get to stay home.  One day I dropped him off and he was crying and clinging to me asking to go home. The teacher just told me to walk away as she picked him up and carried him away. he was reaching for me and screaming and crying.  I felt awful about it but I walked away. \\n\\nFast forward a month of him being in the new school. ( he had about a week or two break between schools) Not ONCE has he thrown a tantrum about going to school. Not once has he kicked and screamed and begged to stay home.  This speaks volumes.  \\n\\nTheir mission appears to be aimed at making money. They are all about the fine print with no regard to our personal situation and how it may be affecting us.  I have three small children, one with medical issues,  to take care of and the last thing our family can afford is to pay money for something like this.   \\n\\nSo much for christian values and caring about families.

This new director is so rude and dismissive of parental concerns. It is obvious to me that she does not care much for the families at the school. This used to be a sweet, family orientated, nurturing school environment - not anymore. So sad. Miss Dee seems more like a stone faced, cold hearted prison warden than a nurturing preschool director. If you want your children to feel safe, secure and loved look elsewhere. I would imagine most of the teachers who have been there for years will soon be leaving working under this new director. They have already lost a kindergarten teacher and quite a few families have withdrawn from the school with similar complaints like ours.

And I found that in Redeemer By The Sea Preschool. Like many of you,  I toured quite a few preschools before we landed on Redeemer By The Sea Preschool. When my family needed the care, Ms. Dee the director and Ms. Rhonda were there to advise and provide what my family needed. Before enrolling, I toured the school twice. Every time I was there early, I observed that other kids seemed to enjoy being there.  My son James has been super-well-taken care of and taught by Ms. Bonnie and Ms. Nina. I just enrolled him in the Enrichment program ago since September, but so far it&apos;s been great and he learns to love art. I even sat and observe in both Enrichment classes (Art and Spanish) unexpectedly since I forgot I enrolled him in Enrichment program and I came to pick him up early. A few points I want to make. (1) For the lady who complained about the noise of the 15 children class. My son is extremely sensitive to noise. But so far he has no problem and he can&apos;t wait to go to school. Mind you, my son is in the AM class. My only guess is your son (who might have been 3 or 4 at the time) might need his nap/rest instead of going to the PM class. When kids that age get tired, they&apos;d cry and act out since they did not know how to express what they needed. (2)This school is very well-organized and the parents need to read the documents and the contracts of what we are signing. I knew I didn&apos;t and I missed out on important details. Fortunately, my overlook in the details did not cause me any monetary setback.  And I learnt from this mistake to always read carefully what paper/documents that come to my hands.  (3) Every preschool will always function as a business, regardless of if it is church affiliated since it will serve a variety of different parents and different personalities. Without written documents and rules, then chaos will definitely follow.  (4) I toured enough preschools around Carlsbad to attest that Redeemer By the Sea preschool is the best choice in this area.\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":2.5,\"reviewCount\":14}}"]},

Located just a short distance outside of beautiful, downtown Chelsea Michigan the farm has plenty of parking.  They were, last time I was there, working on smoothing the entrance area for handicapped patrons but will assist in every way to get everyone up to the restaurant/lodge/headquarters.\\n\\nThe grounds are beautiful.  They have been recently carved out of an old farmstead that had been worked by a family of Michiganders for generations.  They now display various types of farmland landscapes that are common across Michigan.  They are sensitive to the environment and work to support and increase the wildlife in the area.  The work they do also involves ensuring that the plants and other creatures that inhabit the area are kept in stable and then growing populations.\\n\\nIn Spring you may be able to see the elusive Blue Bird nesting and flying about.  There are turtles, frogs and the deer sure like the grazing. \\nThere are beautiful locations for outdoor parties and weddings.  Plenty of space for other activities too.  \\n\\nRobin Hills Farm is not short on science either.

We attended a Yelp event over the weekend, so I learned a lot about the farm and you should know this place is a work in progress.  They&apos;ve been around for 3 years and claim to be an Eco-friendly farm.  The place isn&apos;t officially open to the public, though they are hoping to be so as early as November.  It also isn&apos;t a full production farm, as it&apos;s geared as much to education and learning as it is to farming.  For example, they have a pretty cool vegetable garden which includes two full size green houses, but they aren&apos;t supplying the country side with produce.  You will be able to find their produce at local farmer&apos;s markets.\\n\\nI loved the place.  It&apos;s big and has several areas to visit (garden, animal pastures, an aquaponics building, ponds) but isn&apos;t like going to a working farm, so you weren&apos;t overwhelmed with anything.

This is a review of that space.\\n\\nThe location is quite pretty, but be forewarned that it is, in significant ways, still a construction zone. The parking area is unfinished, as is the driveway that leads in to the complex. Ticket sales and vending (high-priced snacks, farm goods, and chachki with their logo) are done on the edge of the parking area under a temporary tent structure. The restrooms are also located here in a completed structure.\\n\\nThe performance venue itself is down a steep, grassy, uneven hillside from the parking area. I nearly tripped in a couple of significant holes. It had been some time since the venue was last mowed, as well. Clearly, this is not ADA-compliant in any sense, and was rather shocking that they thought this arrangement was OK, especially considering that the audience had a significant number of older members.\\n\\nThe stage is defined at its back edge by a parabolic concrete wall, meant clearly to reflect sound back toward the audience. The seating area consists of several tiers of grass with concrete walls at the back edge of each. The concrete wall behind the actors did reflect sound toward the audience, which was good, else it would have bene very hard to hear them. However, much of the performance took place off the front edge of the stage, meaning that the direct sound from the actors and the reflection off the wall were slightly out of sync with each other - rather distracting and confusing.\\n\\nThe tiered seating worked well enough, except that some people brought chairs and others sat on the grass, so that those sitting on chairs blocked the view of the grass sitters. This was problematical.\\n\\nFor some reason, a microphone on a stand was placed out in front of the stage. It was apparently connected to a single box speaker that was mounted on a tripod and placed to one side of the stage. It was never used, but did interfere with the performance. What they really needed was wireless microphones on each of the performers, with a proper sound system to bring those voices out to the audience. Such a system would likely include speakers to the sides of the stage and behind the audience.\\n\\nCuriously, staff at the venue seemed to think that what they did in the line of sight of the audience behind the stage was somehow magically invisible. One person stood with a large camera kitted out with a telephoto lens photographing the audience. (Did you ask our permission to be photographed? hmmm...) Other staff casually walked past behind the stage or, in one instance, drove a noisy vehicle past, all of which was quite distracting. What were they thinking?\\n\\nIn sum, this venue has potential, but it needs a considerable amount of work and investment in additional equipment. The staff also need to learn what it means to respect the performers whom they invite in and the audience that pays to be there.\"},{\"author\":\"Sheila Q.\",\"datePublished\":\"2018-01-18\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"The restaurant at Robin Hills Farm is finally open!

To the left is the bar area then to the right is a doorway that leads to the bathrooms &amp; the 2 comedy rooms. The 1st room is for stand-up, the 2nd is for Improv. We went into the Improv room, which had a stage &amp; some high &amp; low tables for seating. The setting was quite small &amp; intimate for the most part. Now for the show, it was decent. I have never been to an improv show so I didn&apos;t know what to expect. The 1st half, people went up in groups by levels; the 2nd half people were numbered off into 5 groups. I did have quite a few laughs but it was easy to see who has been doing it for a while &amp; who hasn&apos;t. \\n\\nI did also try some popcorn &amp; a shot of &quot;WOO-IE CK*&quot;, whatever the heck thats suppose to be.

As another reviewer aptly points out &quot; All in all, the school is primarily focused on the French students and the French culture, and makes a poor attempt at being an International school.&quot;\\n\\nAfter relocating to Dallas from Washington State with a freshman high schooler achieving a 4.0 through Junior high, including pre=AP, we had high hopes for college prep that was promised in a private school education experience expanding her multi-lingual capabilities in an IB program.  \\n\\nI could go on an on about the horrific experience at DIS (high school IB program) , but will sum it up here in bullet points:\\n- the headmaster considers himself a &quot;CEO&quot; as in &apos;running a business&apos;.  This mindset is pervasive and reflected in the teachers he hires - few have the child&apos;s best interest at heart, they rarely make themselves available for after / during school hours access and all have second jobs or other outside priorities.\\n- the teacher turnover is virtually 100% in all subjects.  They all have second jobs or other higher priority interests.  A typical example are teachers that are there to get cost offsets for their own children.  Very few (if any) have IB training or experience.  Good luck trying to help your child navigate the syllabus, as often there isn&apos;t one because the teachers are winging it.  The headmaster seems to value teacher education levels (e.g. PhD) over and above any high school or educational teaching experience.  Just imagine your child having to deal with turnover in some of the more challenging subjects, such as 3 Economics teachers, 2 Biology teachers and 3 chemistry teachers in a three year time span.  The headmaster is bad enough, but the teachers are totally disengaged and often firing DIS and leaving, even mid year it was so bad.  And new hires (with other jobs, priorities) ended up making the children attend school from 8:30 to 5:00 pm to accommodate a teachers outside activities!\\n- No AP, SAT, ACT prep - None.  there was some feeble attempt at AP prep, but was made clear by the headmaster that this was not a priority (despite parent demands to incorporate into the curriculum).  \\n- Outside tutors required.  Because the teaching experience is so bad, you had better budget for outside tutors if you are striving for better than a C average grade for your child.  Same for AP prep, SAT and/or ACT prep.\\n\\nUnless you are a French Ex-Pat looking for a school to help educate your child for assimilation back into a Euro educational system, you are wasting your time and money and RISKING your child&apos;s future by going to this school (at least at the high school level).\\n\\nIf your child plans to attend a US college and you want them to be well prepared for college life and have the best chance of getting into the college of their choice - this is NOT the high school for your family.  If you want a private education, there are FAR better choices.  Public Schools in Plano are head and shoulders above this place.\\n\\nBottom Line: Educational Malpractice is how I would sum up DIS High School&apos;s IB Program.\"},{\"author\":\"DD S.\",\"datePublished\":\"2015-02-19\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":4},\"description\":\"We came from a sister school in Washington (FASPS), and as much as we liked that school, we like DIS better.

The French system is much more challenging, in terms of content and in terms of intellectual rigor, than the American system. \\n\\nSo if you have an academically challenged child,  or a child who really isn&apos;t interested much in learning, then this is definitely not the school for you.  \\n\\nIf you have a child who struggled to learn English as a first language, then this school is definitely not for you.  Children take not only French, but Spanish, and at 6th grade can take Mandarin Chinese.  So from age 3, all children are working in 3 languages.\\n\\nIt is not true, as stated another review, that the focus is primarily on French.  In the early grades,the school is 40% English, 40% French and about 20% Spanish.  The ratio slowly switches as children get older, such that there is majority French instruction by Middle School, but there is still a substantial amount of English (it&apos;s probably 60 to 65%  instruction in French by the Middle School level).  BUT this just means the content is taught in French; it doesn&apos;t mean they are learning French all of that time  (they are already pretty fluent by then).  They are doing math, biology, physics, computer science, history,  geography, etc. and they do many of these subjects in both English and French.\\n\\nI have two children at the school, one in Middle and one in Elementary school, and both started at age 3.  I have never hired tutors, and there is alot of homework starting in about 3rd grade.  There is homework help at the school for French, for those children who don&apos;t have anyone at home who speaks French. \\n\\nMost DIS kids are fairly fluent by the 4th grade or so, so they don&apos;t necessarily need help with language beyond that point.\\n\\nThere are teachers at the school who tutor if you need it (I think it&apos;s sort of reasonable to expect that if a child is learning a language and no one at home speaks it,you might need some outside help now and then).\\n\\nMy experience with the French teachers has also been nothing but positive.  The French teachers are excellent.  They are recruited from among teachers in France, where teaching is a competitive profession, where it&apos;s actually rather difficult to become a teacher, and where teacher training is much more extensive than in the US.\\n\\nI know some people sometimes perceive that the English instruction is sometimes not as strong as the French instruction, but what can I say, the American system academically just isn&apos;t as strong, so when you have the two side by side, it shows.\\n\\nDoes that mean the English teachers are not good?  No, it means the French educational system is stronger than the American one, and that, it seems to me, is an argument for putting your child in this school.\\n\\nMy children have excelled at the school. My son scores above the 95th percentile on American standardized tests.\\n\\nI know other parents of children who started at age 3 and went up through MIddle or High school who have the same experience.  I also know that  one of the DIS graduating Seniors last year got a President&apos;s Scholarship at SMU this year, and that is the most prestigious scholarship the school gives.   Given that it was a small graduating class, that is quite impressive.\\n\\nOther DIS graduates have gone on to other universities and earned the equivalent of a year of credit based on their IB scores; in many cases, they have gone right into upper-level courses, and this is especially true in languages.  Some children have gone to universities in Canada, where tuition is much lower than in the US, and where DIS students are more competitive than most American students.\\n\\nAs I said, this is clearly a school for academically-oriented children and families.  If you want your child to go to college on an athletic scholarship, you probably ought to look elsewhere, but if you want a child who comes out at 12th grade with a better education than most college-educated Americans have, this is probably the place for you.\"},{\"author\":\"Scott N.\",\"datePublished\":\"2015-06-12\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"I happened upon the below review by accident and felt compelled to respond.  Let me start by saying that my son has been attending DIS for two years.  He is now in first grade.  The below reviewer neglects to mention whether her review is based on a personal experience with the school or based upon feedback she has heard from others.  My review is based on my first-hand observations..  \\n\\nAt the outset, the assertion that communication is &quot;non-existent&quot; is untrue.  I have a daughter at Parish Episcopal, and I can say without reservation, that DIS does a better job of keeping me informed.  I receive multiple communications DAILY from staff and teachers at DIS.  Teachers will regularly update us on daily classroom activities, which sometimes include pictures of the children performing the activities being described.  Frankly, I love being at my computer at work and receiving a picture of what my child is doing at that very moment.  I&apos;ve never had a school do that before.  The assertion that communication is &quot;non-existent&quot; is simply false.  \\n\\nThe comment that there is &quot;some anti-American sentiment&quot; is equally untrue.  I am a gun toting, conservative Texan and a staunch supporter of our American military, and I assure you that if I EVER sensed any anti-American sentiment, I would whip my boy out of that school so fast that it would make your head spin.  I love this country, and I would never tolerate anything &quot;anti-American&quot; and surely would never voluntarily expose my boy to it.  \\n\\nThe reviewer further asserts that &quot;there are issues concerning the education of the non-French speakers&quot;.  I don&apos;t know what she means, but I don&apos;t speak French, and my boy didn&apos;t speak French before attending.  He is doing great, and his studies are on par with his similarly aged cousins, except that my boy is fluent in French.  And the school does offer a summer introductory course.  \\n\\nThe &quot;social issues&quot; analysis is ridiculous and shameful.  DIS has a zero tolerance rule regarding physical contact.  They are actually very strict.  The fact is that these children are very closely monitored and loved.  Today was my son&apos;s last day of school for the year, and the teachers and assistants were very emotional - some were weeping.  My boy actually says that he &quot;loves&quot; his teacher and her assistant.  I cannot recount the number of occasions that my boy was ill or was struggling with something, only to be comforted by a school staff member or teacher.  My wife and I regularly express to each other how fortunate we were to have him surrounded by people that love him.  The assertion that the teachers don&apos;t &quot;nurture&quot; is categorically, unequivocally false, and it saddens me that someone would characterize them in that manner.  These are simply wonderful people that love what they do.\\n\\nAs for the school&apos;s responsiveness, once again, I cannot give them higher praise.  The school and staff are extremely responsive. \\n\\nAs for the curriculum, my boy is only in first grade, so I don&apos;t have first-hand experience, but I do know that SMU awarded the President&apos;s Scholarship to a recent graduate of DIS.  Here is how SMU describes the recipient of this award:\\n\\n&quot;The President&apos;s Scholars Program is awarded to students who have shown exemplary academic and leadership skills. The award provides full tuition and fees as well as study abroad. Students who live on campus also receive a scholarship for room and board. For consideration for the President&apos;s Scholarships, the highest academic awards given by the University, students must have exceptional achievement on the SAT or ACT and in their high school curriculum.&quot;\\n\\nThe President&apos;s Scholarship is awarded to only 20-25 freshmen.  So, not only did this DIS graduate gain admission to SMU, but he also had what it took to procure a scholarship that was awarded to only 22 of its entering freshmen.  \\n\\nSuffice to say, I am 100% satisfied with from I have experienced with this school so far.  The high school students I have met seem incredibly well adjusted and talented.  It is simply a wonderful academic institution.\"},{\"author\":\"A. M.\",\"datePublished\":\"2011-07-05\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":1},\"description\":\"I went to this school for years before I finally ended leaving. Though the lower school was okay, the upper level teachers are abusive and have no compassion for their students or the subjects they teach. The school does have issues with physical abuse. Slapping, kicking, and punching are regular on the playground. Most of the teachers are washed up french teachers who could not get better jobs with their foreign degrees. Therefore, they seem to harbor ill feelings toward the school and with it, the students. The administration turns a blind eye to abuse from the teachers. A teacher who continuously verbally and physically abused enjoyed employment at D.I.S for over ten years despite parental complaints. Instead of firing the teacher, parents were pressured to move their students elsewhere ( Three during my time at the school).   \\n\\nAs for the psychological effects on the students, most of my peers who stayed ended up socially awkward. I currently work with some current students from D.I.S. At even their young ages, I can see the crippling effects of the school. \\n\\nAcademically,The French-centric nature of the school can cause problems in later years. Students leave D.I.S with limited, if any, knowledge of American History or tradition. I strongly suggest a traditional private or public school. If the bi-lingual track is a must for your child, consider sending them for their formative language years. No child should stay at the school past 3rd grade.

It also cites an incorrect address for the primary school--it&apos;s actually 6039 Churchill Way.\\n\\nMy wife and I weren&apos;t entirely comfortable with the idea of sending our kids to a private school, but we loved our neighborhood and the public school options were unfortunately seriously deficient. We didn&apos;t want to move to the burbs, so we went looking for a private school in Dallas that would teach our children (as we do) that there are more important things in the world than amassing and displaying wealth, which turned out to be a really difficult proposition. However, we found exactly what we were looking for at DIS. We have two sons, 6 and 3 years old--our older son is in his 3rd year at DIS and our 3 year old just started this year. We&apos;ve been overjoyed with the education they&apos;re receiving and with the friends from all over the world that all of us have made through the school. It&apos;s amazing to hear our older son helping his little brother with French pronunciation and teaching him how to count in French. We&apos;ve actually been inspired to get Rosetta Stone for French as a Christmas gift for each other so we can keep up with them as they start to speak (and perhaps conspire) with each other more and more in a foreign language. Everyone at the school has taken a genuine personal interest in our children&apos;s development. Amazingly, one of the teaching assistants who moved to California when her husband transferred jobs still emails us regularly to check on our younger son&apos;s progress since he had a bit of a challenge starting school so young (at 3 years and 2 months). Thanks to her help and the attention of his teachers and other teaching assistants, not to mention all the friends he&apos;s made, he now looks forward to school and it&apos;s sometimes difficult to extract him at the end of the day.\\n\\nSince my wife and I both work full-time, we were especially gratified that DIS offers excellent after school care until 6 pm, with great activities for the kids. Our boys have been exposed to karate, yoga, circus (taught by ex-Cirque de Soleil performers!), gymnastics, soccer, and drama, with the opportunities only continuing to expand as they get older. And, for what we would argue is a much more interesting education, the price at DIS is still significantly less than most other Dallas private schools. If you&apos;re looking for a school with a great football team and lots of Bentleys in carpool line, this is not the place for you. If you want your children to be in a challenging yet nurturing environment that prepares them to value and understand the world outside of the provincial Dallas establishment, DIS is a great choice.\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":4,\"reviewCount\":13}}"]},

I didn&apos;t realize how good Clifton School was for my son until I moved to another state.  Clifton School is truly a one-of-a-kind experience.\\nThings I loved:\\n1)Smaller class sizes- My son was first in one of the infant classrooms and then transitioned to a toddler classroom.  There were about 8 kids per one AM or PM teacher and an additional assistant.\\n2)Reggio Emilia approach to teaching- You can check out a better definition on Wikipedia.  \\n-Basically, the approach believes in discovery learning through exploration and creativity.  Each child is allowed his or her own learning style.  Group learning is important too (my son at 20 months could say the names of his classmates).  There is a curriculum coordinator who goes classroom to classroom to see how the kids are learning.  At a point in the year, the coordinator/team calls you to let you know how your child is doing.  Also, there are sit down meetings with teachers.\\n-It&apos;s actually much bigger than just a way of learning.  The approach also believes in an open curriculum so that teachers can change plans based on children learning.  \\n-The physical environment is important too.  Reggio schools have open areas with piazzas.  Kids aren&apos;t just shuttled between a small classroom and an outdoor playground.  The infant classrooms, for example, are clustered together into a &quot;village&quot; with an open indoor gross motor play area called a piazza.  Each village has an outdoor play area as well.  This is very unique.  I&apos;ve toured multiple daycares in Kentucky and most are not this open with natural lighting.  You might not think this is important but if you were in a small classroom day in an day out you would start feeling cramped too.\\n-The approach believes in parent involvement.  Clifton School has a PTA that meets on a regular basis and generates money through fundraising.  Each class has at least one class rep.  Parents for each classroom are put on an email list, so concerns can be addressed.  There are multiple ways in which you can submit concerns from the classroom to the administrative level.  This is unique too.  Again, multiple daycares in Georgia and Kentucky DO NOT allow this level of parent involvement (eg kindercare, primrose, clarian place).\\n3)Great use of resources\\n-Each classroom has a digital camera.  The teachers take pictures of the kids during the day and write a small one slide powerpoint that goes out to the parents&apos; email list.  You really feel connected to what the kids are doing that day.  It gave me a smile at the end of my day to see an email with a picture of my son playing a drum.  I used to send the email attachments to grandparents to let them know how my little one was doing.\\n-The Clairmont Campus now has access to fresh fruits and vegetables from a local farm.  Parents place orders and pick up their produce at the Clairmont location.  This is a great sustainable living initiative.\\n-They hire real photographers from the community to come take pictures of kids for class picture day.  They have a music teacher who sits down with individual classes.  My son got to see someone play a harpsichord when he was 18 months old.\\n4)Great teachers- great education backgrounds and they love the kids.  When my son was about to move, tears were shed by teachers and administration.  I really felt like I lost a second family.\\n\\nWhat I didn&apos;t like:\\n1)It&apos;s been mentioned on Google Reviews that the administration isn&apos;t responsive to parent concerns.  I did have an issue with the closure-due-to weather policy and didn&apos;t get feedback.  I&apos;m not a pushy parent and ended up not caring.  The truth is that there are multiple ways to communicate with the administration, unlike other day cares.  If I were pushy enough, I could&apos;ve brought it up at a PTA meeting.  I remember the parents got upset that the teachers were only sending out daily word ppts instead of ppts with pictures, and someone posted a complaint to the parent email listserv.  The problem was resolved that week.  \\n2)Clifton School is only open to Emory and CDC employees.  I&apos;m not entirely sure of all the reasons for this but it&apos;s really not fair to keep this great school confined to a small group of people.  Clifton School will now be receiving a Georgia lottery funded pre-K and enrollment has to be open to the community.  Maybe this will change their opinions.  \\n3)The price!  This school is expensive and I&apos;d like to believe it&apos;s worth it.  The school grounds, technologies, and equipment are really kept up nicely.  Parents of infants have Similac available as an optional part of the program.  We cut down on formula costs after the switch to Similac.\\n4)Long wait list- I applied in late Summer of 2012, delivered Sept 2012, and my son didn&apos;t come off the wait list until May 2013. \\n\\nBoy, I could write more but it looks like Yelp won&apos;t allow it.  I hope this gives a little more info than the angry reviews out there.\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":5,\"reviewCount\":1}}"]},

They sincerely practice what they preach.

Despite his challenges, they never lost sight of his unique strengths. Now that he is in first grade, he is thriving.

He is learning conflict management skills, mindfulness, empathy, and how to be a good member of a team. As someone who works with business leaders, I know that these lessons will be invaluable in his life. I once told the headmaster that he radiates warmth.

The teachers are very good and I believe her level of learning and exploring out paces her previous local day care center.  I&apos;m writing this review to point out a few items for prospective parents to consider before selecting TSS.  Food is not included with tuition, so packing lunches is a requirement.  They&apos;re strict about no peanuts, so no PB&amp;J&apos;s at this school.  They&apos;re also fairly particular about monitoring how you prepare the food (slicing round things to avoid choking hazards, etc) and making sure it&apos;s nutritionally balanced.  We received some &quot;coaching and counseling&quot; (soft approach) on this topic.  Also, the hours for &quot;full time&quot; are 830am-330pm.  For working parents this can be tough since it does not coincide with conventional work hours.  There&apos;s no extended care option (currently) at the EL campus.  If you&apos;re a stay-at-home parent looking for some time to yourself, then this may work.  Also, you pay tuition for the month.  (Full disclosure, their calendar is published.)  We had wished we&apos;d reviewed it more closely.  We feel we pay a lot in tuition while they seemed to be closed quite a bit or pop the random 130pm pick up for staff meeting.  I don&apos;t understand why they can&apos;t schedule their staff meetings after 330pm to avoid additional inconvenience to those paying for &quot;full time&quot; care.  As working parents we&apos;re often scrambling for supplemental care or taking lots of time off work to accommodate.  They don&apos;t pro-rate the tuition to reflect all the time they require early pick up or all the closed time they incorporate into the schedule.   The EL campus follows Decatur school&apos;s calendar, even though many of our older kids are on the APS schedule (Drew).  We have found ourselves with 1 child off for a break (spring/winter etc) 1 week and the TSS child off the next.  We&apos;re paying lots of $$$$ for camps, sitters etc to cover childcare while we work.  Also, they spend a lot of time outside in a muddy, dirt (not much mulch) play area...so we&apos;ve thrown away lots of trashed kids clothes.  In summary, when they  ARE open....the learning opportunities and staff are good.  This is not the place to send your kid if you work full-time or have other kids in the APS school schedule.  It&apos;s roughtly twice as much per month as our old pre-school, provides no food, opens 2 hours later than our and closes 2.5 hours earlier than our other center, and is probably closed/closes early an average of 4 days per month more.

If you pick up late, there is a $1 fee per minute. That is fine by me. So sometimes I was late and happily paid the fee. Then I got an odd phone call about it, reminding me of the fee. So i responded that I knew about the fee and was happy to pay it. (i am very direct). But I asked, are you hinting that i should not be late? Is it a problem? (I don&apos;t speak in code). The person said it was fine to be late as long as I paid. Later I found out from my child, he was being separated out from the &quot;staff kids&quot; and made to stay indoors with the teachers. While this first explained to me as a staffing issue, my kid was completely incorporating this into his self-image, and moping around saying he wasn&apos;t a staff kid, if he couldn&apos;t complete a challenging task. When I asked again about this, another staff person told me this was a deterrent. Not a punishment, but a deterrent. Look these words up, a deterrent IS a punishment, they were trying to deter ME from being late, by punishing my kid, instead of just telling me straight out! The administrator who told me this was aggressive in her body language and her tone, to the point where i actually sat down, to make myself small and relaxed to defuse what was becoming an ugly situation. This is unacceptable and has never happened to me in the business world.  Then to make things extra fun, they called my *EX husband to ask him for MY credit card number within minutes to get my payment for pulling my kid out. I believe that is illegal, let alone unethical. This place has an amazing philosophy, but some of its administrators are willing to let children be hurt, and are willing to raise their voices, over simple policy matters they could just be straight about.

You get to participate in a smattering of circus acts, which is cool-- but none of them are exceptionally unique or fun. For example-- you get to walk on a wire that&apos;s a foot or so off the ground. You juggle some scarves. You climb a rope. You do some basic gymnastics on a static trapeze that&apos;s just barely high enough that you don&apos;t hit your head when you hang from your knees. Cool-- but I didn&apos;t feel very circus-y, frankly. Also, I see this class listed as an awesome &quot;alternative workout&quot; in various places, and it&apos;s really not much of a workout, unless you are very very out of shape.\\n\\nI will say that the owner, Carrie, is very kind and clearly passionate about her studio. The place is charming and home-y, and the cats that roam around are delightful. That said, I was never really sure who was teaching the class?

Before going here, bear in mind that this is not an aerial yoga class nor is it a circus-inspired cardio workout. You will execute actual circus moves and techniques, with particular care paid to your safety and the safety of those around you. I know someone who was disappointed in the structure of the class because they wanted to jump right in and start flying, but that just cannot happen in all practicality.\\n\\nWhen you take the intro class, you will be assigned to a group and you will rotate between various stations. One is the Spanish web (which most people would probably describe as rope climbing), another is the stationary trapeze (no flying here), then there&apos;s the tight rope and juggling, and finally human pyramid building. At each station, everyone in the group gets to try the routine there, and you can repeat it if there&apos;s enough time. I&apos;ve been to two classes and at the end of one of them, the instructors did demos on the high trapeze and the Spanish web - very cool.\\n\\nEven though this is not an aerobic workout, it is definitely a strength and balance workout and will likely work some muscles you haven&apos;t used for a while. It&apos;s also really fun to do things I don&apos;t normally do in my workouts.\\n\\nThe instructors are really nice and they keep track of whether you&apos;ve been there before so you can start with something more advanced the next time you go.

It wasn&apos;t worth a dime. I&apos;m originally from the northeast and have taken beginner&apos;s circus arts classes in the past that were physically challenging, well-organized, and in a very comfortable environment. Circus Arts Institute was the complete opposite of that. The room itself is small and dark with only one trapeze and one Spanish web. The class said it had room for 20+ students, but felt cramped with just 7 of us. The instructor was a complete waste. He was cocky, a show-off, and unprofessional. He made myself and my girl friends feel very uncomfortable, kept complaining about how hungry and tired he was (I am a full-time student and work full-time, you don&apos;t have to tell me twice what tired is like), and spent more time showing off his own skills than actually helping us as students to improve our own. We each got one chance to climb and one chance to do a series on trapeze. In an hour and a half class we spent at least 50 minutes stretching (yes stretching is necessary, but this was just ridiculous), 2 minutes on trapeze, 2 minutes on Spanish web, and the rest of the class throwing around scarves and calling it &quot;juggling&quot;. I was so incredibly disappointed in this class and my friends were as well. What I thought would be a challenging and fun workout turned into a waste of time and money without even a drop of sweat to be shed.

And you didn&apos;t feel like an idiot if you messed up or had difficulties with things.  I wasn&apos;t as scared as thought with the trapeze routine.

The instructors and classmates were very patient with everyone. The tightrope was easier than it looks.  The cloth juggling was interesting, but pretty boring.

It was an amazing experience. Wendy is an awesome teacher and explained each step of the process thoroughly. She made herself available to the students and did a lot of one-on-one work.\\n\\nAlthough we all made the same project (a ring), Wendy made sure there were many opportunities to customize it. You determine the band size of your ring, decide to have a patterned or smooth band, whether or not to have a stone set in the ring, and the color and shape of the stone. I left Amalgam with a beautiful handmade and custom ring! \\n\\nThe 10am class went until 2pm with many opportunities for snacks and bathroom breaks in between. The way the class works is Wendy explains each step as you go along and floats around the room to help people complete that step. For the complicated steps (i.e. Soldering), Wendy works with students one by one to ensure safety and correctness. When you&apos;re waiting for your turn or letting your ring sit in the &quot;pickling solution&quot; as Wendy calls it, you can relax and do whatever. I snacked (bring food or buy it at the cafe right outside), socialized, and studied for an upcoming exam I had; so, bring things to do or not - just a heads up. \\n\\nRemember to wear close toed shoes, and be ready for an easy, relaxing Saturday at Amalgam if you take the 4 hour workshop, which I highly recommend. It&apos;s a fabulous activity for mom/dad and daughter/son dates, a girl/guy&apos;s day, or plain ol&apos; self care. \\n\\nLocation and parking: The studio is situated in a grouping of buildings that kind of look like bungalows. When pulling into the lot, you won&apos;t immediately see Amalgam. You will see a small cafe and a storefront with a big letter &quot;D&quot; on it. Amalgam is between those about 100 ft farther back.

She is very patient and helpful as you go through the process (and believe me, it&apos;s a process, involving pliers, soldering, hammers and a dremel) to create a pretty ring. \\n\\nThe class is a little long because it&apos;s a process.

Her teaching style is very hands on, which is great. But she&apos;s anti-note taking, which didn&apos;t work well for me. Basically she explains the next 8 or so steps (which include using a torch and a saw) and then whenever you forget what&apos;s next, you&apos;re supposed to ask her for the next step. I (and the other students) spent half the time waiting in line to ask what&apos;s next. If I just guessed and moved on because it was taking too long, she inevitably let me know I had messed up. She saw I was being really careful with the torch and started getting impatient, just doing the torch work for me when I had asked for help doing it. Wendy has a very strong personality which you will might love, but I found a little grating after a while. I ran out of time to finish my project and asked if I could pay to come finish it at open shop hours (which she had previously said we were welcome to) but then she told me that was only for more advanced students and I should really just sign up for the next 8 week class (I really just needed an hour or two to finish a couple things).

Inquiry is taken as immediate attack on the establishment. Read further for experience.  \\n\\nFor the first two weeks of school at Maria&apos;s Montessori, pick-ups and drop-offs were alarmingly abrupt. The door is opened long enough for kids to enter, then closed again. So with no view into the school, these were the things I did witness:  full lunches returned every day (except one day when his homemade empanadas went missing, even though he said he&apos;d only taken one bite. I will let the reader consider what happened there). My son would say he drank no water, no &quot;work&quot; done (Montessori language), movies, marshmallows for snack, crying and describing kids punching each other, no books read, teachers hitting kids on the head.  Any concern I had about academics went out the window in comparison to my son&apos;s physical well-being.  \\n\\nMy son had never had issues before this school. But, understanding that every story has two sides, I gave some benefit of the doubt and reminded my son and the door contact each day that he needed to eat and drink water. Thursday and Friday of that first week, stomach pain started. My husband and I decided that without any way to see into the school or avenue to ask questions, it was time to follow her procedure for communication and schedule a conference to see if Maria (owner) could shed light on our son&apos;s reports. We could also offer them some Montessori-based solutions that his prior school and I used to get him to eat and drink, plus seek some system of transparency.  \\n\\nWe emailed Monday of the second week requesting a conference with a suggested time - no details about our specific concerns. After a followup email to Maria Wednesday evening asking if I could expect a call at the suggested time, the response I got at 6am Thursday morning was alarming. Maria stated that I was expecting immediate results in my son&apos;s academics, that I should choose another preschool, and that I could come collect my son&apos;s things that day.  Review: I had not spoken with Maria about any of my concerns, seeing as her handbook clearly states that issues require a scheduled conference. In my attempt to follow policy, her response was to kick my son out.  \\n\\nMy husband said we needed to go see her immediately. When we pulled up to the school Thursday morning, I tried to establish a shared purpose (we both want a contract), explain my intentions for a solution, and ask if the email she sent was a formal cancellation of the contract. However, she immediately launched into how her history as a business woman, and that I was not going to question her establishment. Not once did she seek to hear what my son was struggling with, her concerns were in no way child-centered, and always included how much she is having to work. When my husband came up and tried to mention that it was physical nutrition, she LAUGHED! and said they don&apos;t &quot;force feed children&quot;. Maria kept repeating that our relationship was not going to work. On the third time, I realized she was right.  In seeking a partnership around how to best serve a child to understand how my child is being treated within the school, we were told that we had no place there. She also accused me of not bringing up the issue at pickup and dropoff, when I was trying to respect HER clear guidelines.  \\n\\nMy son is now in a different daycare, and the transparency there is like night and day from Maria&apos;s. We met his teacher, we get to meet classmates, we get a letter each day with concrete evidence of what our son worked on. Maria&apos;s Montessori is not a safe environment for children if those children are not allowed to voice how they are being harmed. If anything, the incredible defense in response to any attempt at questioning Maria should serve as an immediate warning to any parent considering the school - tell-tale sign that transparency is her enemy.\"},{\"author\":\"ML G.\",\"datePublished\":\"2016-02-23\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"I love Maria&apos;s Montessori School!

Moving from CA to Utah recently and not having any family in town, my husband and I talked about hiring a doula for the birth of our 3rd child. When Hanan and I first met, my 2 little ones were a little wild and couldn&apos;t sit still that morning. Hanan was patient with them and took her time with me. I felt very comfortable and wanted to hire her on the spot. She was so nice, knowledgeable and caring. I knew I didn&apos;t need to interview anyone else and she was the one I wanted to help me while I was delivering. My husband and I spoke that afternoon and I immediately let her know that we chose her! Anytime I had a question and yes it could have been a silly question she always answered. She gave us a recap on a class in our home and it was nice to go over things that I forgot or may have not known from my previous 2.  She made me and my husband feel comfortable and looked forward to delivering baby. I ended up getting induced. Since my husband had to be with both kids and was going back and fourth between hospital and home, Hanan came shortly after labor and delivery checked me in. She was there every step of the way. I had no idea if I was going to have a non medicated labor or have an epidural. She provided me knowledge along the way. She kept my mind off contractions. She used techniques to help my contractions feel better. She was positive and kept cheering me on. When I got to 7 cm dilated I didn&apos;t think I could do it. She encouraged me and was my cheerleader.  I got to 8 Cm dilated and I was freaking out. The pain was horrible. All I wanted to do at that point was to get an epidural but I knew I couldn&apos;t. I got this far and knew I had to finish up what I always wanted to do. Hanan was right there helping me try to feel comfortable. Again using different techniques and just being positive and calm. Next thing I knew I had to push. Hanan knew it was important to me to have my husband with me while baby was being born. She went out and got him and stayed with both of my kids while I pushed baby out. I am forever grateful to her for being there for us, helping me get through a non medicated labor , being positive and calm and being my cheerleader. She was an amazing doula and gave me a birth experience will never forget. One of the best birth experiences we have experienced. I would highly recommend Hanan to anyone asking about a doula.

The background of ENMU is that of liberal arts with a recognized music program. The university offers over 60 degrees from associate to masters level. Eastern has one of the lowest tuition rates in New Mexico. The option to work on 100% online degrees is provided with 8 undergraduate and 9 graduate programs.\\n\\nEastern is located on the Eastern border of New Mexico and Texas. The campus is located in Portales, NM, a town of about 17,000. Approximately 20 miles NE is Clovis and Cannon AFB with a population of about 35,000. The nearest large cities are Amarillo, TX and Lubbock, TX.\\n\\nThe campus itself is relatively small in size when compared to other universities such as New Mexico State University or University of New Mexico. Several projects to renew/rebuild buildings are currently in works. The most recent upgrade was the building of a new music building. On the books are the building of a new tech building and possible upgrades to the liberal arts building.\\n\\nThe population of the university is very diversified with a noted population of first generation college students. There is a program in place that allows Chinese students to come study at ENMU for two years and then on returning to China they complete the remainder of their education.\\n\\nClasses are relatively small allowing for more interaction with instructors and professors. There is also a strong athletic program ranging from football to soccer.\"},{\"author\":\"Greg M.\",\"datePublished\":\"2011-11-01\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":4},\"description\":\"My wife went to ENMU and loved it.

A school official put their hand on our 5 year old and threw away a snack item from his lunch that WE pack and pay for, because he wasn&apos;t eating the food in an order that was how she wanted him to. A teacher told us in confidence about it and our son told us after we asked him about it. We emailed the principal about the situation and she straight-up lied to us, even though she wasn&apos;t present for the incident. She told us she knew for certain that our son brought that snack to school worker and told her she could throw it away. When asked for video footage from the cafeteria during the time of incident the school superintendent emailed us directly with snark that they &quot;don&apos;t eat in a &apos;cafeteria&apos; because of COVID mitigation.&quot; Which was not remotely the answer we were looking for. To paraphrase: &quot;Hey did your employee put their hand on our child in the cafeteria?&quot;  &quot;Well... ACTUALLY we don&apos;t eat in the cafeteria, they eat in the GYM..&quot; Two of our neighbors on base have had similar incidents with their children at this school. ADDITIONALLY, if you read the reviews here on Yelp, you will find ONE POSITIVE review. Apparently, a mysterious &quot;Jim H.&quot; has glowing things to say about the organization. It&apos;s the Superintendent Jim Haley. I believe he left that position this year. But during his time running that school, he apparently found the integrity to grade it fairly on Yelp.. If you are military and forced to be stuck in this city with its absolutely horrendous education infrastructure, don&apos;t fall for the hype that this private education center will be any better. New Mexico is trailing the entire nation in education and test scores. At this point, the tragedy of being stationed in Clovis is that your child has ZERO good options in this city if you want them to be on pace with their peers in other states. Home school is unfortunately your best option. Whatever you do, do not trust these people and their remarkable lack of integrity with the person you value most.

She still needs assistance in areas but I&apos;m confident by the end of the fall she will be almost completely independent. \\n\\nI do feel that the classes have a wide range of student ability but the teachers are good about tailoring it to each child&apos;s level of needed help.

Wings of Water is straight forward in their mission - it&apos;s a swim school. Some parents told us they move at a snails pace and that was also our experience. That&apos;s likely part of the business model. \\n\\nAfter signing up for classes nothing here is straightforward and I don&apos;t really know how they run the business, because you have to continually do the leg work. Whomever owns this place isn&apos;t involved in how it&apos;s being managed. We initially had one teacher and then after one class were told that she was double booked, so we&apos;d have to be flexible and get another teacher instead. Fine. Our regular teacher was engaging and I wouldn&apos;t give her 1. \\n\\nOver the course of several months there were so many cancellations and the subs ran the gamut from somewhat involved to preoccupied. \\nWhat I really don&apos;t like about Wings Over Water is the way they treat clients. At Summer&apos;s end, we had the last lesson of the month and the instructor then told us she was no longer offering private classes, so we&apos;d have to get that sorted. There&apos;s no continuity. \\n\\nWhen we inquired at the office the woman rolled her eyes, stressed they be on a break for several weeks, and she could add us to the wait list. The utter lack of communication and care for informing people is just shoddy business. Every interaction with the front desk felt frazzled. \\n\\nI&apos;m happy to invest in my children learn skills, especially swimming, but after a complete $1200 Summer program my children are more content in the water and eager to learn, but not full swimmers. I&apos;d look elsewhere and now understand the discontentment of other parents. \\n\\nAlso, there was no enforcing of the current city issued mask mandate, despite hanging signage.

If your lucky to get a slow day or a time the pool is dead that&apos;s when your kid can get attention without chaos.

We love Melissa/Edie, the owner of the place and the teachers we have had, except for one and he has left.  One of my girls developed a sudden fear of jumping in after she&apos;s been there for a session and had been doing so with no issue.  Melissa not only guided her out of that phase, she did so gently, though firm with her request without making my daughter feel afraid or bad.  For weeks, Melissa thought out of box and came up with really creative solutions for my daughter to try until they figured out something that worked and after that within a lesson or two, my daughter was back to water loving self.\\n\\nPositives:\\n* facility - awesome heated pool in a warm room so kids don&apos;t get cold coming out of the water; separate viewing room at a comfortable temp\\n* cleanliness - I know they are strict with their swim pants request, but the facility is spotless and their strictness with the policy makes me feel comfortable knowing my kids may swallow some water\\n* awesome instructors and really amazing teaching methodologies\\n\\nI completely disagree that they keep your kids in a level longer than necessary just to make money.  I know that it&apos;s hard to see your kids in the same level a few times when you think they can swim really well.  But they really evaluate your children accurately based on their techniques and needs.  Just because your kids can &quot;swim&quot; around, it does not mean that they are doing it with the techniques that WOW is looking for in the next level.  Why does this matter?  Well, in the next level, they would be looking to build on that technique, if your kid doesn&apos;t have it down, it would slow down the whole class while the instructor works with him/her on it.\\n\\nCons:\\n* definitely VERY expensive, but not more than penguin and some other high end swim schools that don&apos;t even have their own facility\\n* some of the front desk staffs.  While we love the original front desk staff, the new ones have not been of equal quality and some are down right rude or incompetent.

The front desk was very encouraging and attentive to my needs. Even though I live in Stamford, they suggested I enroll right away (but my class was a peak-traffic time--that&apos;s a whole other story).\\n\\nI was suggested to enroll in the adult beginner class. I believe this was the wrong call completely. Even though the class size was small, each adult was on different levels. One student had already begun lessons a semester or two prior, one was an elderly woman who had much more experience with water than I clearly did, and one other adult, who was late to register had picked up on what I was having trouble with for a week on her first day. Needlesstosay, this really affected my self-esteem.\\n\\nThe instructor was not personal, and was not able to give me the attention I needed during class. Our interaction was simply, awkward and uncomfortable, and I do not think he took the time to establish a sense of understanding between him and I, and for something I felt completely skeptical and unsure of, that is, the water. I already didn&apos;t trust the water, or find my own strength, and he never allowed me to trust him either.\\n\\nEarly on, I considered switching to private lessons, and wondered if one-on-one would be better for me. Upon multiple attempts to bring up my concerns either by speaking to someone at the front desk (before or after class), making phone calls or filling out request forms, my needs had not been met. Ultimately, I ended up spending extra money on a private lesson in addition to the class. \\n\\nAfter feeling as though my performance was not sufficient for the school, and that my needs were not important enough to be met, I decided to simply quit, and not show up. There was no follow-up from the school, so I ended up calling, finally, to inform them that I did not want to be a part of the class. I did not even mention a refund, since that is against their policy. \\n\\nI believe there were many things I learned as a young adult in the real-world of service. I was a customer--a nervous, uncertain and confused one at that--but one who paid in full--and A LOT of money, to have the opportunity to be supported in something that is one of my greatest challenges and fears. W.o.W sort of...ruined the idea to ever learn how to swim and did not give me any attention. I felt terribly alone and unsupported. I did not feel as I was part of a team that encouraged me. I understand they were busy, and primarily serve their younger learners; I also understand I was discouraged and insecure.

Their method of teaching is really one of a kind. It&apos;s not the same old routine you find at your local pool. They teach swim safety before your child is even learning strokes etc. Because, really that is what every parents wants don&apos;t they? ...for their child to be SAFE in the water? \\nCase and point 2 summers ago my daughter was 3 years old. We were at a friend&apos;s pool and she was playing on a floating mat. She wasn&apos;t a STRONG swimmer but Melissa taught her how to be SAFE in the pool. As she was floating and playing with her cousin, I knew in the back of my mind that she as going to fall in and I was ok with it. I actually wanted her to fall in because I want to see if she could react properly while I was safely watching. Within minutes she flipped over and was in water over her head. Now it&apos;s one thing to see your child do the safety drills in class but, it&apos;s another to watch it in action with no instruction. She fell off and did EXACTLY what she was taught and swam to a safe place and held on until I could pull her out. She has been taught safety in the water which to me in invaluable. The comments about the staff being rude are simply not true. Melissa and her staff are firm yes. But, this to me is imperative in swim instruction. Children need to know while swimming is fun we have to always be safe and listen to instruction. I couldn&apos;t imagine having her being taught anywhere else. My now 16 month old is enrolled and loving the water. The owner Melissa is incredibly passionate about swimming and she is just amazing with the little ones. She got my daughter through a really tough patch of being scared in the water. She really gets to know these kids and what works for them individually. Give them a shot.

Kristin was having so much fun with the kids (a good 4 to 1 ratio) they were learning safety throughout the entire class and my son did more than he&apos;s ever done in the water in that 30 min.

I have been taking my kids there for 3 years and they love it. My first born started as a baby, and my other child started at 6 weeks old. The staff is incredibly helpful and takes the time to get to know each child and their needs. I get a hand written report daily that lets me know what times their diapers were changed, how long they napped, and what they ate. Sometimes when I come to pick my kids up they don&apos;t even want to leave because they are too busy playing with the other kids and the teachers. They have excellent playing areas. The &quot;big kid&quot; playground has plenty of jungle gyms, swings, bikes, etc. as well as a lot of grass for them to run around and play tag. The teachers are always out there playing with them games such as duck duck goose, and red rover. The little kid playground has lots of smaller toys for the toddlers and the teachers are always pushing the babies in the swings. The meals are included in your tuition and my son always talks about how good the food is. He especially loves when they have corn dog nuggets. The center even has a K-4 program that my son will be starting next year that I am so excited for. Overall, I have seen a huge difference in my children compared to other peoples children who do not go to Kid Plus. My children are far more advanced due to the hardwork and dedication the teachers put into each child. They don&apos;t just sit them down in front of a TV or send them to the playground to do whatever they want. Every day is structured with a schedule which helps us out at home because my son has a routine, which helps his behavior out a lot. The teachers always do crafts as well, my fridge is covered in a million different pictures my kids have done over the years. They always bring home sweet little poems with handprints for mothers/fathers day. The teachers also try to have parties for the different holidays and nothing makes my kids happier than bringing cupcakes to school and getting to share them with their friends. I would reccommend Kid Plus to every parent out there. I could not imagine having a better day care facility to take my kids to. In fact, I will be sad when my oldest has to leave day care to go to the elementary school. I will probably leave him in their after school program so I can pick up both my children at once.\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":3.5,\"reviewCount\":3}}"]},

In my forties I thought it was too late to go back, I was so wrong, and glad that I did.  Online schooling is a challenge as one needs to think outside the box and sometimes be a mind reader of what their professors might be looking for.  I recieved both my BS and MBA at Columbia Southern University and learned confidence in areas and schools of thought that I did not have before.  The courses will challenge you and the college is at a great price.  And before any of you go running away at the challenge, remember that the challenge is what you learn from and need to overcome.  In many of the programs you will learn more than your education, and will find a staff that has your success in mind.  The extra things I learned were patience, professionalism, and the courage to seek clarity like a pro and within academic policies and chains of command.  They are flexible and even had life flexible terms that you can choose from.  Although only a nationally accredited institution and a member of the Distance Education and Training Council, they are as of 2022 under review for being regionally accredited. \\n They also have an alumni association that students can be recommended to.  Check them out.

I have to disagree with the person who said that this college is as easy as or easier than high school. Yes, most of the work you submit is essays; however, that is the challenging part.  The coursework is very rigorous. I have attended both a b&amp;m college as well as CSU, so I can attest that this college is definitely harder. You can&apos;t plagiarize essays because they use Turn It In for many of the classes and major points are deducted if the redundancy rate is too high. I have had this happen, even when none of my material was plagiarized. So, I had to learn to use more of my own words and and not quote so much material. If you can easily write essays, you might consider this university easy. However, if you struggle with writing and thoughts don&apos;t come as easily to you, like me, then you might have a different view of this school. In one class alone, I had to write 18 essays. It would be much easier to have multiple choice, like I did in high school or like I did when I went to my b&amp;m college.  However, I will say that I have retained more information through my coursework at CSU than I have at any other school. I retain more information when I have to write than when I have to just memorize information for a short term. There is no extra credit or making up assignments. If you don&apos;t do the work, you will not get a good grade. I would recommend this university to any working adult who does not have time to go to college the traditional way. If you enjoy independent learning and don&apos;t have to be in a classroom,  you will like CSU.  I am a senior at CSU, graduating this year. I do not feel like my degree is being handed to me; I have worked hard for the degree that I will receive. This journey has been more time consuming and stressful than I could have ever imagined, but well worth it!\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":4,\"reviewCount\":20}}"]},

They offer studies in the fine arts and in the Italian language, and I only studied art, so I have no idea how the Italian education was.  The school&apos;s art &apos;curriculum&apos; is very misleading, seeing as they actually have none, and a lot of the &apos;subjects&apos; they supposedly had only exist if you bring it up to the teacher yourself.  I think that the only redeeming quality about the school was the very dedicated teacher at the time, who was very knowledgable, pushed his students to do better, and clearly loved art.  Two out of three of the people who run the school didn&apos;t seem to care very much about the students nor their experience at the school, which is probably why some students were unhappy with the structure of the school if they were studying there long-term.  I&apos;m not sure who the main art teacher is right now.  This very tiny school is a good option if you want a very simple and basic experience in Florence and in the arts, because you do get a lot of freedom to just study whatever you feel like doing.  In that case it&apos;s really nice, and a great option for people who want to learn art basics!  Also, they&apos;ll provide very, very basic art supplies if you need them.  However, I would not recommend staying there longer than 3 months at the most -- any more than that would be repetitive and the certificate in the fine arts that they offer doesn&apos;t seem to be very official.  If you want a long-term study look into another school or even better, a university!

Because I studied Italian before, I didn&apos;t want to learn the language from the very beginning. This way I could start at my own level, together with students who where as far as I was. It wasn&apos;t hard for me to get along with the other students, because they would make the same errors as I did. I was in a class with Rafaella and she is very sympathetic. She includes everyone and even though we only spoke Italian, she made everything very clear.  If someone makes a mistake, she takes the time to explain. This also makes lessons very intense. One lesson, that takes about four hours, can maybe consist of only the grammar of one aspect. We could talk about irregular verbs and tenses very extensively. Because of this I wished I could follow the course longer than two weeks, because not everything of my level, B1, could be covered. But for me, because I study Italian at home, it gives me the opportunity to ask questions whenever I do not understand something. I like the fact that there is enough room to make mistakes, I didn&apos;t feel &apos;stupid&apos; at any time.  Rafaella will help you if you have a hard time putting sentences together. \\n\\nPractically: the school has a great location, in the heart of the centre. It is nice to walk to town when lessons are over. Also the school doesn&apos;t feel very &apos;crowded&apos;. Its groups are small. When you are alone, the school provides tours with a guide and cooking lessons and aperitivi, which are great to do if you don&apos;t know the city and you want someone to tell you where you should go ;-) I really felt like the teachers and the staff in general know what they are doing, making everyone as comfortable as possible.

I am also an educator. I must say that this administration, as far as European administration goes, is superior in its customer service.  They are sensitive, efficient, and genuinely kind even to difficult students.  Specifically, there was a clerical error with my tuition. I was panicked as I didn&apos;t speak the language fluently and realized how difficult this situation could be.  Fortunately I saved all the necessary documents (as one should) showing that I had already payed.  As I approached the desk asking about the notification, documents in hand and ready to &apos;prove&apos; my case, the director simply stated that he was sorry, and that it was a filing error on their end, and there was nothing to worry about.  No questions, no proof needed, and nothing but smiles and relief on their end. \\n\\nAlso they have a &apos;welcome&apos; package all ready for their new students.  It&apos;s full of little tidbits that will help you get through the first few weeks on your own. So thoughtful!  They make you feel welcome, are very sensitive to any anxieties you may have about being there, and can manage different levels of fluency in Italian seeing as the administration speaks a great deal of other languages fluently. (I personally witnessed, not only English, but Japanese, Spanish and Hungarian.) \\n\\nSecondly, the scaffolding of the educational system is very well done.  There were classes for beginners of all levels, intermediate studiers, and even for those who wanted to master the language.  Outside of grammer and conversation, are myriad classes to take, I chose the COOKING class with Signora Fiammetti. I have to say that this cooking course was far superior to any of the cooking courses I attempted to take in France.  When I tried to do my research to find a place in France to do this, I found that either the prices were outrageous OR the skill level of the educators in the kitched were disappointing either in the language pedagogy OR in the skills/products used or made in the kitchen.  Neither of these were true about the cooking course I took.  Signora Fiammetti is a professionally trained chef/caterer, raised in Tuscany/Italy and trained in Paris.  Her organization was unbeatable, exceptionally well paced, and her tips on cooking were among the top I have ever seen.  I am no stranger to the kitchen, but she was able to give me a very wide range of tips, even on the basics of cutting an onion, or tearing basil.  The 4 course meals we prepared were unbelievable in the subtleties of flavors and the colorful presentation of food.  If you are a lover of food and cooking, I highly HIGHLY recommend this as an option.  I also have to say that our course had about 3-4 people in it, and of different levels of fluency in Italian. No matter!  We still spoke whatever level of italian we were equipped with, and her patience and teaching skills still helped us learn while we were cooking!  Incredible!\\n\\nLastly,  the teachers were so well adapted for their subject matter.  One member of my family was in the beginners level, while I found myself in the advanced group.  The instructors for beginners had, for people just getting used to the language,  teachers with an unparalleled amount of patience, kindness, organization and genuinity.  The advanced group had teachers that were of university-level brilliance in their subject matter (literature, language, etc.) and while at times their pedagogy seemed unfamiliar, I found myself challenged not only on a linguistic level, but an intellectual level as well. The extra tours with Caterina were fantastic!!!\\n\\nAreas of improvement:  \\n\\nAir conditioning:  During the hot months (and I imagine the same of the cold months) the lack of air conditioning made the learning particularly difficult for everyone in the class.  \\n\\nPedagogy (differentiated instruction for different groups taught) schoolwide is probably needed on a small level.  Therefore it might be a good idea for the administration to sit in on all classes from time to time to comment on style of instruction and just to provide feedback.  Also, perhaps all the teachers get together periodically to discuss methods. I feel that it would improve the solidarity of the school and increase the available methodologies of instruction between teachers. Strengths of each teacher can benefit the entire school in this way.\\n\\nIn summary, I would easily go back to this school.  The school is unbelievably rewarding for anyone wanting to learn about not just Tuscany, but Italy in general!  Put this on your list!\"},{\"author\":\"John S.\",\"datePublished\":\"2015-04-26\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"Hi guys, I were in Florence attendino a 2 week course, everyday Italian classes in the morning and every afternoon an activity (as you mention in your question): monday we went discovering the secrets in Florence, tuesday we had a cooking class, wednesday a Chianti tour and Farm visit, thursday we went shopping, then the Uffizi Gallery..great!

If parents DO ever get to attend anything, good luck finding out about it!  Its almost like they don&apos;t want the parents to know anything or be involved. The director of this daycare is extremely uncommunicative with parents. I&apos;ve called and emailed her several times with a few issues over the years, but never received a return call or email. The final straw was when they LOST my son&apos;s registration paperwork for summer care!! They called my husband at work to come and get him because they didn&apos;t have his paperwork and the classes were full. As if that weren&apos;t bad enough, they made my 4 year old wait in the office for 30 minutes until my husband could get back to him, instead of letting him at least go and play for a little while with his friends.

Woodlawn, Henley and Powell were known as the oldest white public schools in Birmingham, the others having been built after 1900.Actually, the school that occupied the site of the old Powell School that burned yesterday, was called The Free White School, and a picture of it appears in another article featured in the Birmingham City Archives&apos; digital collection. \\n\\nHISTORICAL MARKER READS:\\nBirmingham&apos;s first public school was named for Colonel James R. Powell, the city&apos;s first elected Mayor. This energetic promoter also served as the first President of the Elyton Land Company (now Birmingham Realty). which founded the city in 1871. Two years later, Colonel John T. Terry led the fund raising to establish a &quot;free school for white children.&quot; The school was &quot;free&quot; only of ties to a religious institution for fees were charged according to grade level. Mayor Powell donated his salary, police court fines and other city fees to support the school.\\nThe present red brick Victorian Gothic style structure, designed by S. J. Hall of Cleveland, Ohio in 1888, is the third Powell School. Until 1918, the school accommodated grades one through twelve and for a time served as a training school for prospective teachers\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":5,\"reviewCount\":1}}"]},

Pool is very nice, when it is actually open and available for open swim. Classes are full of old people and not a very big selection of classes for younger more active/fit individuals. This gym definitely caters to the older crowd as they offer senior discounts. They cater to tourists and locals who won&apos;t pay for a full membership as they let anybody in for $5...good luck playing basketball because the gym is full of a bunch of rowdy thugs who just come and pay $5 when they want to play some pickup ball with a bunch of buddies (who aren&apos;t members either).

Without the help of Dr. Park, taking numerous AP classes in addition to participating in sports and other after-school activities, all while maintaining a good academic performance would not have been possible.

Without their SAT prep class, I don&apos;t think I would&apos;ve been able to get into the college of my choice or get a good scholarship.

It&apos;s great to see growth.  I&apos;m going to give an un-biased report:\\n\\nI scored around a 2300 through prepping here, back when the &quot;new&quot; SAT was new.  I took the SAT once on my own and prepped through 2 more SATs here, and after prepping with them, obtained a perfect score on the Writing.  I also ACT-prepped here twice and got a 34 (out of 36).\\n\\nThe Academy helped plan my academic path early on and naturally, I used their college prep services, and got into Columbia University, University of Chicago, Northwestern, Georgetown, etc (oddly enough, I was waitlisted at University of Washington in St. Louis, though lol).  It came down to Columbia and Northwestern, but I ended up going to NU.\\n\\nOne thing I must emphasize about their college prep program is that it is truly comprehensive.  Like, they help you from A to Z and beyond.  Their philosophy is &quot;Let me help you get your kid into his/her Harvard,&quot; but they don&apos;t stop there.  They aggressively focus on scholarships.  I got a full ride merit-scholarship into Northwestern (whereas, ivy league schools don&apos;t usually give scholarships but are great with financial aid if you need a lot of it).  So, at first, I was a bit sad not to go to Columbia, but in the end and looking back, I was really pleased that I walked out of college debt-free AND got a stellar education.\\n(P.S.- back in the day, Columbia was ranked #9 and Northwestern was #11, so it made little difference ranking-wise where I chose to go.  In 2013, Columbia is at #4).\\n\\nSo, even though I may SOUND biased, I mean, I did walk out with fantastically improved scores, a fantastic college prep package, and got into my absolute top choice schools.  I got results--and not just any, but the ones I wanted.\\nI am not writing this because I work here, or because I was asked to.  I try to be a very honest person in life, and I would never have chosen to work here if I didn&apos;t think their services or philosophy was up to par.  The truth is, I decided to teach here because I agree with the philosophy and practices.  They truly care about education and each student.  I&apos;ve seen the founders help less privileged students by writing off hours and giving them scholarships, and I saw them do this before the company became bigger--usually the time of initial &quot;company growth&quot; is not the time most business people act so generous.  They&apos;re not in it for the money, they&apos;re in it because education makes the world a better place.  Their kids both went to phenomenal undergraduate and graduate programs but are working/will be working in the public service sector.\\n\\nTrust me, and not just because I work here (though, it should encourage you to come, as I did score in the 99% and am one of their best tutors), if you are passionate about your education and being/becoming successful, you want to be here.  There is no other place you&apos;d personally want to be, or send your kid.

I read every review and felt really comfortable and excited to take my daughter there for her very first time in a daycare situation. She has been involved in many activities with other children and babies, but I&apos;ve always been there, so I was nervous,  especially being a first time mom, but I decided it was time to give it a try and trust someone else with my child. I was initially turned off, because no one introduced themselves or even acknowledged my presence other than the person who checked me in. She was there for an hour and a half while I went to an appointment.  When I arrived to pick her up, she looked more upset than I&apos;d ever seen her, but I assumed she was getting tired and that she was just upset because I wasn&apos;t there. I was told that the hour and a half had &quot;ups and downs&quot; but that she did pretty well overall and was finally playing happily by the time I got back. Unfortunately, as I was buckling her into her car seat,  I noticed that she had blood in her nostrils,  a fat upper lip, and red marks on her forehead.  I went back in and asked if she had fallen. First she said that she hadn&apos;t fallen, but then I showed her the injuries, and the story changed to, &quot;oh yea, she fell off of the bench of the picnic table not long after you left, but I didn&apos;t see any blood. Do you want me to clean it up? &quot;. Then I was told that next time, I should take her in the morning when it&apos;s not so busy and when there are more kids her age and that since it was President&apos;s Day, it was an extra busy day. So this was somehow my fault? Why should that matter? If you can&apos;t accommodate a 1 year old safely,  change the age requirements.  Honestly,  if someone would have even told me that she fell, I wouldn&apos;t be as upset. Accidents happen.  She&apos;s fallen a hundred times at home. I get it. What I don&apos;t get is why no one told me and why the story changed from one second to the next. You should also change your policies and regulations information, because you don&apos;t actually notify anyone of accidents. This first daycare experience just validated all of my fears, and I won&apos;t be back, and my mom friends won&apos;t be either. It&apos;s really disappointing, especially since I&apos;ve already purchased a groupon for myself and friend, but the money isn&apos;t important.  I&apos;d pay double if I could trust them. I honestly feel really terrible that I have to be the first negative review,  but a fat lip for my baby is a fat lip for your business.  I&apos;d suggest you be up front next time instead of hoping someone doesn&apos;t notice the injuries.\\n\\nUpdate \\n\\nAt 3:34 PM on February 20, 2018, the director of Giggles called me. She said she was calling to check on Eleanor after her fall. I told her that I thought she was fine and told her about the marks under her nose, and I asked her why they had not told me about the incident until I had noticed the injuries myself. She told me that she had not called to argue and that she just wanted to let me know that situations like yesterday don&apos;t usually happen. I again asked why she did not tell me about the fall, and she said that my daughter&apos;s face had been so red from crying, that she didn&apos;t notice the injuries, and for that type of incident, they wouldn&apos;t tell the parent. I told her that I would not be returning. The policy clearly states that parents will be notified of accidents. She offered to refund me for the ten hour that I had purchased for myself and for the five hour Groupon that I had purchased for my friend.\\n\\nRESPONSE TO YOUR GENERIC RESPONSE :\\nI guess laws and regulations are different than common sense and decency. No thanks.  Again,  this is not a money issue,  so please stop trying to make it one. If it was, I would send you her doctor visit receipt as well. I only updated my review to be thorough and fair and to show that your director did not tell me about the fall because she hadn&apos;t noticed injuries.  That&apos;s unacceptable.  My daughter has a full head of hair and could have had hidden injuries or a concussion that I would have never known about if I hadn&apos;t seen for myself. Your director also was the one who originally said she did not fall, changed her story when she saw the blood, and then on the phone admitted that she actually was the one who picked her up off of the floor and consoled her after the fall that didn&apos;t happen but did happen. We won&apos;t argue about it though. I never said anything about laws. YOUR policy that I signed contradicts your actions. Another insincere and mechanical response won&apos;t be necessary. I&apos;ve already taken the actions that are appropriate in this situation. I&apos;m sure it won&apos;t happen to anyone else&apos;s child.\\nAlso, Caroline Kimball is the owner.

It&apos;s true. But what is it that makes them a disgrace? Why do they deserve such a title?\\n\\nLet&apos;s examine their academics. Often a freshman-level class is remedial in nature. English classes center around basic grammar, middle school-level vocabulary, and the basics of writing a paper. These are the things one should have learned prior to college. And while a review of the basics can be a good thing, students and their parents are paying thousands of dollars for these remedial courses for the first semester or two! The jump in difficulty after the first year is not something to be ignored either. The average student has to suffer through intensely difficult classes after taking a year to settle into an easier pace. And students soon discover that the grading system used is more of a measuring stick for how much you failed.\\n\\nYou see, students are not treated with respect at this school unless they have proven themselves to the faculty. There are many students who deserve respect at Bob Jones, but unless you&apos;re a suck up or a tattle tale, you often are regarded as nothing by the school. I&apos;ve seen students work extremely hard throughout the year only to be humiliated during class by the teacher. And I&apos;ve seen students glide through semesters because they were suck ups of the worst kind. Now, don&apos;t get me wrong, not all the teachers are bad. But in my experience, there were three kinds of teachers. There were the GAs, which were students working through graduate school. The GAs were pretty much all friendly and helpful. Then there were a handful of good teachers, Dr. Ormiston is an example of a tough but caring teacher. And then you have the rest of the teachers who looked down on most of their students. \\n\\nIn the end, those who manage to make it through to graduation, will find that in most places, their degree is worthless. Because despite what BJU advertises, they aren&apos;t actually accredited. Sure, they&apos;re &quot;accredited&quot; by a group of southern religious schools, but that doesn&apos;t mean anything outside of Christian circles. That&apos;s four years (at least) and thousands upon thousands of dollars wasted, unless you plan to get a job with Bob Jones. And that would probably work out, since those that make it through are trained to think just like the school wants them to think. Students are not prepared for the outside world. The students are trained to fear the secular world, and jump at the mention of something unbiblical. One might call this level of conditioning &quot;brainwashing.&quot; And that wouldn&apos;t be too far off.\\n\\nYou see, despite claiming the Bible to be their foundation, the school actually wrote their own book of authority. This handbook claims to be inspired by the Bible. But that is an outright lie. While other schools might have rules like &quot;Don&apos;t run in the halls.&quot; or &quot;Don&apos;t bring drugs to school.&quot; BJU&apos;s rules are &quot;Don&apos;t be outside your dormitory past 10:30 PM.&quot; and &quot;Don&apos;t bring an iPod on campus.&quot; In a dystopian fashion, the lives of all the students, be they on or off campus, is invaded by the school&apos;s rules. Regulations cover everything from the kind of music they can listen to all the way down having to ask permission to leave campus. Students actually sign a contract that basically states that they will not exercise their first amendment rights.In fact, the school is so paranoid, that they reserve the right to revoke a graduate&apos;s diploma within the first three months after a student graduates. There is no appeal process for this. The school can literally make all those years worthless if they decide that you are not the kind of person they want you to be. Of course, they&apos;ll keep all the tuition they took from you.\\n\\nFinally, BJU ignores the concept of grace, while flaunting the concept of judgment. Students have to fear for their safety, lest they break a rule. Students are forced to fill out forms about what they did over break. If they broke any of the rules, they are subject to discipline. If a student is struggling with sin in their life, they cannot seek help. Because the most help a student is offered is mandatory therapy sessions. And that can still come with a side of demerits bringing them closer to suspension or expulsion. They practically thrive on punishing wrongdoers. Unless  the wrongdoer is on their board of directors, as was the case a couple of years ago. It was then that they virtually threatened the entire student body to be silent about what happened. \\n\\nBJU is a disgrace. I urge you to stay away.\"},{\"author\":\"Austin A.\",\"datePublished\":\"2018-02-14\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":1},\"description\":\"Beautiful campus, there are some lovely people there.

They booked me an appointment three times and each time I went it was closed and no one called or called back. When I decided to question such a service in a friendly manner I might add. I was told too bad just book another appointment so I said no I would rather a refund for the remainder of the service as I will not be coming back a 4th time.

My child specifically was paired with an aggressive child because my child was mild mannered and they considered him a &quot;good influence&quot;. While I understand that helping out others should be encouraged, 8 year olds are not counselors and certainly should not be responsible for dealing with aggressive children. When our children left that school, my youngest was a full year behind in math when we transferred to another local school. I was never contacted about there being a problem at all.

I think theater camp would be a great place for loud, assertive children. It was for me when I was a loud and assertive kid.

Certainly better than most community colleges, but still lacking in a lot of regards. While I was attending Dr. &quot;Sean Connery&quot; Williams was heading the school, and it has become apparent that the UAH board was all about the money. Forcing full time students to get a crappy meal plan and other such nonsense to support their add-ons. Meaning a half Chick-fil-a, and a gas station-like convenience. Nevermind chick-fil-a is a block away from the school so are gas stations. \\n\\nAnyways, it is just apparent that they need to work on their care of the students. I was lucky enough to have great starting advisers (Freshman - Sophomore engineering); however, liberal arts department is sorely lacking a great set of advisers.\\n\\nSchool isn&apos;t overly hard, but definitely harder than a community college and my attendance at UNA.
