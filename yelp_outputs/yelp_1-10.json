NWACC is large enough to encompass a plethora of experiences. So, a review that begins, &quot;My algebra teacher was a bore,&quot; wouldn&apos;t begin to characterize the potential of any community college.\\n\\nAs for me (who functions as an employee, one that has worked at other community colleges and universities), I enjoy the campus, which is nicer than many other campi (noun, Latin plural). That is important; I like clean lines. The library, which is always the clincher, will more than adequately support most any academic endeavor, for both student and professional, with friendly assistance. As for the education, accessibility is stressed, I have clearly seen, which is good news for many. And, out of the classroom, college culture is promoted in a variety of ways, for those who require that.\\n\\nWhat else can be said? Yeah, that one guy cut me off in the parking lot.

We entered to building... Yes we entered the building and walked around for 15 minutes looking (without a code) and did not run into a singleness member. This should have been our first warning to run but I gave them the benefit and tracked down a worker due to no staff being in their offices either. The staff member said they were celebrating a event and said tonsit and wait and the director would come out and speak with us. So we waited for 15 minutes and subsequently I went and tracked down another staff member and asked if the director had time for us today. Finally the director came out of a room and seemed irritated to even speak with us. She said no tours could be given today. I asked if we could come back later in day to do a tour and her response was no I have to pick my kids up at 3. I then asked her if anyone else was available to give a tour and her response was no.

Children learn to investigate and research from a very young age. The learning is sparked by interest - so the child is more invested in it. \\n\\nThe Montessori method truly is remarkable and Walnut Farm does a lovely job of presenting an authentic experience. The classrooms - both indoor and outdoor - are led by caring, passionate teachers where the students are encouraged to engage with the lessons. They are empowered to learn and given the necessary tools to do so.\\n\\nIf you have a child between 18 months and 12 years and want more than just a traditional education, consider a visit to Walnut Farm. It is my greatest hope that you see what my family saw the very first time we set foot on the campus.\"},{\"author\":\"Charlie Ann H.\",\"datePublished\":\"2013-11-23\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"I have one child at this school and will be enrolling our youngest soon.  I love the school and their curriculum.  It really gives the children freedom to explore what interests them and therefore stretches their attention and learning.  They have an outdoor classroom with a teacher outside at all times for instruction.  I think that is amazing!  There are two trained teachers in each room.  They offer Spanish, art, and life skills along with your typical school subjects.  We are very happy with the school and so is our child.\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":5,\"reviewCount\":5}}"]},
