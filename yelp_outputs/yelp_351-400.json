I contacted the school in late October to arrange a tour to obtain more information. We are considering a number of private schools for our son and Creative Montessori was simply one option. In response to my request, I was told the first tour available was February. That&apos;s right ...4 months just to obtain a tour. I thought I had misunderstood the email so I called them. Lisa confirmed that this was indeed the first tour because they are so busy with tours. If it takes 4 months just to visit as a prospective attendee, I can&apos;t help but wonder how long it would take to get a parent/ teacher meeting if my son actually attended!! There are far too many other fantastic private schools in the area to consider.",

During those years she learned to love learning, she became very independent and driven.  In addition to getting a sound academic background, she learned to understand and appreciate people from all walks of life.  Character education is a huge part of the program at CMS and the values learned are applied to all areas of life.  My daughter has become a happy and successful adult who continues to seek knowledge and has a tremendous love of and respect for all people.

As American Muslims raised in Alabama, navigating the intersectionality of our various identities was often challenging, and upon becoming parents, we wanted to ensure our son would be cared for in an environment that embraces each individual child and their unique attributes. The staff here is highly professional and caring. The facilities are clean and uncluttered. I&apos;m continually impressed by the activities that our now 14 month old partakes in: various fruit tastings, artwork, Spanish lessons, circle time, etc...So far, despite the expense (comparable to similar facilities in the area) we are so happy with our choice and eagerly look forward to our son&apos;s continued growth and development at this school/daycare.",

The first time I came here was to help my grandmother get supplies to make a christening gown for my daughter. The people in here are so friendly and helpful and produce some amazing looking items.\\n\\nMy wife and I were gifted a smocking class by family and gave us a different experience with them than what you normally have with a retail store. And yes, I did take a smocking class... and it was a blast! The teacher really helped us learned the strategies and was great about it when we made mistakes (which is bound to happen). It was a fun experience that we have not utilized the benefits of to its fullest potential.\\n\\nAnything else we have needed, the staff here has given great assistance. Any time we need fabric or have questions, the Smocking Bird is our go-to place to visit.",

She asks to return back to Mathnasium.  We have all three  go.   My youngest daughter was super strong in all areas except two.  \\n\\nMy oldest son is doing algebra I in 8th grade.  He was strong in most areas with a few missing.  Both older kids struggled on some parts of the assessment because they were not allowed to use calculators.  \\n\\nApparently, they both make straight A&apos;s in middle school because they know how to use a calculator.  Thirty days later attending 3 days a week and oldest son and youngest daughters are great with masteries on weak areas. My oldest daughter is going 4-5 days a week to get ready for Algebra I after taking no pre-Algebra classes.\\n\\nI ask my kids how is it?  All of them say...Mathnasium teaches math in such a way that makes it easier and faster to learn.\\n\\nI am a huge fan of this place because I have seen how they took two young kids confused by common core (youngest does not have it) and turn them into A students and confident in math.  This summer will hopefully give all three a strong foundation to continue as they prepare for high school!",

This is the third college I&apos;ve been to and by far the worst. The biggest reason I am leaving such an awful review is the fact that the financial aid office has refused to process my fafsa unless my parents commit tax fraud. They were separate at the time but the school wants them to refile as married not separate. I also owe the school a bit of money since scholarships didn&apos;t cover enough and fafsa wasn&apos;t processed so I had to solely rely on that. So I got a loan but I was told it wouldn&apos;t be active until the first day of classes. That means yet again my attempt to relieve the hold and register for classes was a bust. Next up is the food, the cafeteria seems to constantly under cook food. More specifically the chicken is almost always raw. And third is the teachers, but most specifically an english teacher named Mrs. Carter. Who gave me numerous zeros for assignments I turned in without any explanation why causing me to go from a B to an F in the last few weeks of classes. All in all I do not recommend attending this university.",

We were able to take pictures in the weight room, and me and the boys got a chance to enjoy the beautiful campus they have. It wasn&apos;t that far from Birmingham, and the staff really seem to care about their students not &quot;Just&quot; as football players, but as individuals and their success in the classrooms. Overall, this seems to be a really good college, and even though, once again, its not an HBCU, I will fully support this school.",

            "description": "This Museum is located across from the Troy campus. It is co-located with a library that is only accesible to Troy students. They have metered street parking right out front and within a reasonable walking distance.\\n\\nThe site of the museum is significant because it is where Rosa Parks was arrested on a bus for not giving up her seat. It has a historical marker out front marking the location. It has a neat sculpture outside that can only be viewed directly, any other angles and you are looking at some posts in the group.  There is also a very nice sculpture of Ms. Parks sitting alone in her seat on the bus. It makes for great photos.\\n\\nThe museum is small and offers self guided tours. There are no pictures allowed in the main exhibit area. The tour begins in a small room with benches around it. You watch a movie about segregation in Montgomery, the bus system and the boycott. Once the movie is over, some doors open and leads you to the next area. The next area is a pretty neat reenactment of Rosa Parks being arrested on the bus. You view the action as if you are viewing it from outside of the bus. It is very nice and really makes you feel like you are in the action. \\n\\n After the reenactment on the bus, some doors open up to a gallery that has exhibits, videos, artifacts, and pictures. You move at your own pace from this spot until the end of the tour. You will see a replica carpool vehicle over there, you will also hear stories told by people that were there during that time via videos and you will see a display of leaders riding the bus after the boycott ended. They give you the option of using your phone for an audio tour in a few sections of the museum. It provides you some information about what you are looking at. I did not use it because it seemed like more effort than what it was worth to me. Some type of push button audio kiosk would be perfect in its place. Anyway, as i mentioned, the exhibit area is not a very big area. We went through it in about 15 minutes.. The entire tour took us about 30 minutes. Even though thee is not a lot to it, it was still a nice visit and I  learned a bit. It does a good job making you feel as if you are back during that time.\\n\\nNo museum would be complete without a gift shop, this one is no exception. They have a small gift shop where you not only purchase you museum admission, but you can buy souvenirs like shirts or bags.\\n\\nAll-in-all this a decent museum. I love that it is located on the historical site where the bus incident occurred. It is small, but still makes a great impact. It&apos; is definitely worth a visit if you are in downtown Montgomery. I would recommend checking out some of the other nearby museums, like the Legacy Museum and Civil Rights Center to maximize your trip.",

This was really just an intro to welcome to the museum. \\n\\nWe spent probably 1.5 hours here without doing the second portion. The last half of the museum has lots of reading, but the first part was a great simulation experience that even the youngest would get a deeper understanding of Rosa. The museum store could be improved as there are so many amazing kid books about Rosa Parks.\\n\\nThe library next door was mentioned as something to do - but they said this was only for school groups. Don&apos;t forget to walk several blocks to see the Rosa Parks statue at the fountain.\\n\\nThis is well worth the entrance fee!",

On the second floor is a photo timeline of Civil Rights events and informational columns highlighting the important faces of the movement and their story.\\n\\nBack in the main building is a gift shop, exhibition art hall and a self guided tour highlighting the famous story of Rosa Louise McCauley Parks and her defiance to give up her seat on that faithful day. What I never knew about the history of this event was that it wasn&apos;t altogether random. Rosa Parks planned to do this with the help of other civil rights leaders so they could use it as a launching point for a federal case against the unconstitutional segregation laws in Alabama. It was only an idea, but Rosa fulfilled it when she found the opportunity, because it couldn&apos;t be staged. That takes nothing away from Rosa Parks. The danger of such defiance was deadly real, as witnessed by the Freedom Riders in the same era.\\n\\nOddly, the case was not brought to court using Rosa. Instead they used the first person to actually defy the bus laws, young Claudette Colvin, whom was 15 and pregnant at the age of her arrest. Her arrest happened on March 2nd, 1955, a full 9 months before Rosa&apos;s arrest on December 1, 1955.\\n\\nThe story is told using a full sized model of a Montgomery bus as you stand outside of the bus looking through the windows (which utilize TV screens). The bus is set in a room that looks like a small movie set with buildings, a faux street and streetlights. Here is a link to a Youtube video of this exhibit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h82ajl69iy0\\n\\nOVERALL it is a great experience, especially when coupled with the other Civil Rights museums in the downtown area. Not far away from the RP Library the City of Montgomery is working to construct a park and monument @ the site of the famous bus stop where Rosa boarded. Not sure when it will be ready as digging was underway during our May 2019 visit. The Library is actually the location of the arrest. Both the Time Machine exhibit in the Children&apos;s Annex and the Bus Arrest exhibit in the main building are must see&apos;s when visiting Montgomery Alabama and the Freedom Trail. Come see the quiet unspoken life&apos;s work of a Civil Rights pioneer.\\n\\n\\n2019/82",

After the initial exposition, you follow into another room where you free flow and explore at will. If you are not familiar at all with the Civil Rights movement, well, there are lots of reading to do on these displays.\\n\\nThis is one of the better exhibits I have been to, and I truly think they should make it a traveling exhibit.",

But still. \\n\\nI guess the bus time machine would be cool for grade school kiddos. I mean, the video was informative and all but the shaky bus was just a goofy distraction for me as an adult. And since the Rosa Parks hologram wasn&apos;t working I cannot comment on the most critical piece of the museum: The actual part about Rosa and the boycott. Oh well. \\n\\nOn the other side, the room opened up but they had to turn the lights on in order to see the graphics and pictures. I basically just walked through and read the placards. Towards the back, when you walk through the larger exhibit pieces and follow the boycott timeline that&apos;s where it gets cool. They did a good job with the last section of your visit. \\n\\nCustomer service was great at the front desk. But in the gift shop where you buy your tickets I felt like the lady was irritated that I bothered her with a question.",

The artwork and artifacts are excellent.  There was free parking in the lot opposite corner of the museum.   Although the metered parking was plentiful and cheap.  Coins only though.  The museum took about an hour at a leisurely pace.",

            "description": "Great little museum on the site where Rosa parks was arrested for refusing to give her seat up to a white man on a city bus in 1955. There&apos;s a short video about segregation in busing in Montgomery and then a short video which depicts the way the arrest occurred. And then there are a couple of small rooms containing artifacts relating to her arrest and the subsequent successful Montgomery Bus Boycott, including the original fingerprint arrest record of Mrs. Park as well as other court documents and police records. (There is also a small gallery which, when I visited in April 2018, had some very powerful art by V. L. Cox.) The museum is a little on the small side, but well worth a visit if you want to learn more about Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott in the place where that history occurred!",

The tone of the 4 people that I encountered was not very helpful or patient. \\nOnce we got our tickets we went to the Children&apos;s Museum which consisted of a big noisy &quot;bus ride&quot; that played a video that took the rider through history up until the Rosa Parks incident. I found this part very overwhelming even as an adult. \\nBack at the museum we watched another short film and then went into a room to watch a video reenactment of the night Rosa Parks was arrested. \\nThe museum has other paintings, photos, memorabilia, and artifacts that take you through the civil rights movement. \\nI would say this is a &quot;must do&quot; while in town.",

I didn&apos;t have a lot of time but they have a gallery, in case you don&apos;t have time for the museum. There are two parts to the museum so you should leave about two hours. When I return I will probably take the time to really take it in. I didn&apos;t count on there being so much to see in Montgomery.",

This is probably why the first time we tried going, we thought it was closed but it said it was open. But it&apos;s because we were at the children&apos;s wing entrance. So be mindful of that. Just walk up the sidewalk and the Museum and Library entrance are right there. \\n\\nDecided to take my 7yr old, because it was the day of the midterm elections and she&apos;s doing a report on Rosa Parks for school. \\n\\nShe said it Mae her feel a little creeped out. I asked her &quot;why?&quot;, because we had also gone to the EJI&apos;s Lynching Memorial and she didn&apos;t find that disturbing at all. Apparently for her the photos and videos at the Museum make it more real for her. But she did retain a lot of the information about Rosa and the boycott. \\n\\nI&apos;m going to ask if her school will take the kids to the children&apos;s wing next year. \\n\\nThe staff is friendly and very helpful. Enjoyed ourselves",

Hurry up&quot; is the text that I got from my friend while making a slight detour and hitting the restroom instead of walking into the &quot;time machine&quot; immediately after paying $28 for two adults do to both the Children&apos;s Time Machine piece as well as the museum.  \\n\\nWhen I walked through the doors, I saw what he was talking about. Inside a big room sat an over-sized replica of a bus surrounded by used computer parts and lights that were intended to make the place look like you were traveling back in time. I don&apos;t know if I would have called it creepy - but with him being the only person in the room, I can see why he wanted me to hurry up and get there so they could start. That&apos;s right.. it was just the two of us along for the trip through time.\\n\\nThe feature started and Mr. Rivetts, our &quot;bus driver&quot; (which looked like the robot from the movie Short Circuit) took us on a trip through time starting in Cincinnati meeting a young boy named Jim Crow and ended up in the 1950&apos;s after being introduced to Mrs Parks. While definitely geared towards children, it was worthwhile to go through. There were TV&apos;s throughout the entire room and the walls became projection screens, so even if the room was packed with students on a field trip, everyone would be able to see.\\n\\nAfter going through the Children&apos;s part, our admission also got us into the 1955 and beyond part of the exhibit. A much smaller room was waiting on us with very few seats, but we sat down and watched interviews on three projectors and learned more about Rosa Parks specifically. After about 15 minutes of watching this, the automatic doors opened and we were outside on a street corner in 1955 watching and listening on the city bus when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat. \\n\\nThe rest of the tour was a self-guided walking tour of the bus boycott, church meetings, police reports and historic memorabilia. As I walked through the museum, I thought to myself many times &quot;I can&apos;t believe this happened only 50 years ago!&quot; \\n\\nLearning about this in the history books is one thing.. walking the streets of Montgomery and seeing it unfold on a likelike tour is something completely different. I&apos;ll always remember this trip and be thankful that I was able to do it.",

            "description": "Troy University oversees the Rosa Parks Library and Museum.  After a trip to the Civil Rights Museum, we stopped by here.  Without a doubt, the Rosa Parks tour features the most interactive and engaging setup that I have ever seen.  After passing the ticket gate, visitors are invited to watch an opening video on a three-panel television display mounted high above.  Given that we were a large group, seating was insufficient, but we didn&apos;t seem to take issue with plopping down on the floor.  In retrospect, it gave the video a drive-in sort of feel.\\n\\nThe next stop was an audiovisual tour of the Montgomery bus boycott.  A facsimile of the bus appeared against a wall.  Audio recordings simulated Ms. Park&apos;s refusal to vacate her seat; though Rosa&apos;s voice actor&apos;s speech was a bit slow, I appreciated the accompanying voices&apos; authenticity until the moment of her arrest.  This part of the museum was very dark, so I would urge visitors to be careful navigating this space.  The doors opened to reveal a walking exhibit of the planning and aftermath of the bus boycott.  The guide continued to walk among the exhibits and ushered us through them.  When we got to the end of the walk, double doors featured an audio recording of a MLK sermon; at its end, visitors were invited to walk through them, simulating a church revival service.  The tour ended shortly thereafter.\\n\\nI think the only thing I have to recommend is being told what else is in this building.  I suppose it worked out well since we had additional stops planned.  Nevertheless, I urge visitors to view other exhibits in the museum.  Of interest is a room showcasing the tattered clothing of enslaved Africans, their names tagged on the sleeves.",

(I will update my rating after school starts up again.)  So far I like that the kids can come at any time on any or all of the five days that it is open and can get one-on-one help with tutors for the entire 1 hour session if they want it.  I also like that at the end of each session a progress report for each kid is provided to the parent which tells what the kids worked on, what they have accomplished and what they need to work on.  The kids get instant rewards for completing session work to keep them motivated, and also earn &quot;cards&quot; they can save up and exchange for prizes in the future.\\n\\nThe facility is always clean and orderly, and the people who work there are friendly and helpful.  If you have more than one kid enrolled at a time there is a discount on the others.  The owner is very nice and works with the kids as well.",

Therefore, my wife and I drove from another state to take a tour and were told by our daycare to do it unannounced to get a true feeling on how they interact with the kids and with you. We entered to building... Yes we entered the building and walked around for 15 minutes looking (without a code) and did not run into a singleness member. This should have been our first warning to run but I gave them the benefit and tracked down a worker due to no staff being in their offices either. The staff member said they were celebrating a event and said tonsit and wait and the director would come out and speak with us. So we waited for 15 minutes and subsequently I went and tracked down another staff member and asked if the director had time for us today. Finally the director came out of a room and seemed irritated to even speak with us. She said no tours could be given today. I asked if we could come back later in day to do a tour and her response was no I have to pick my kids up at 3. I then asked her if anyone else was available to give a tour and her response was no. After this attempt my wife and I left. Please don&apos;t bring your kids to this daycare due to safety concerns with anybody being able to walk in /out unannounced and the unpleasant staff that could possibly take care of your kids.",

There wasnt any  prior intimation, nor were parents concerns invited. I mean how can you demote a child to a lower school program, there is definitely some big difference between the two levels.   I observed that the children in early preschool were mostly exposed to television and showed stuff like Curious George ... \\n\\nThough we have relocated and thankfully out of the class otherwise i would have to wait for my child to go to Junior again only if there was any vacancy again.  So weird !!!\\n\\nThe teachers, esp Ms Becky, junior preschool was great... however the school management is not very friendly.",

I will speak for the infant/toddler rooms only for this is where my child was at during his enrollment. There is high turnover with the teachers, inconsistent structure, sporadic or sometimes no updates on child throughout the day on the &quot;daily connect app&quot;, dirty rooms, children sharing their belongings, etc. I had a Tylenol bottle come up empty after just buying it! Was this given to my child? Other children? Nobody seemed to know anything about it. My child came home with a huge scratch on his arm and there is still a scar from it. Again, none of the teachers knew what happened. I would not recommend this place for your child especially if you are like me and want to have good interactive relationships with your child&apos;s teachers and be informed about your child at all times.",

They could never pull the correct amount out and continued to pull over $500 bi-weekly. While I was having a meeting with the director, she continued to interrupt me and yelled at me. when I addressed her yelling at me, she said &quot;it&apos;s because you&apos;re getting upset with me&quot;. I then set up a meeting with the owner of the Mustard Seed Location and the Ark location. During that meeting she could not explain where my money was going and why it was being pulled incorrectly. She then continued to say that my &quot;money doesn&apos;t even pay the bills&quot;. Go to take my son in the next day after the meeting and was greeted with being told my son can not come in the building. Teachers are amazing! The staff is very irresponsible.",

First off, yes I will agree with Rachel J&apos;s review below about the previous asst director, however since we started she left about a month after and things couldn&apos;t be any better!  I get updates on my little girl throughout the day and pictures as well!  I love all the art projects they do with the little ones and book reading, exploring, playing outdoors, etc.... No matter how young, they have a curriculum planned daily for your little one.  I don&apos;t feel like I could even come close to matching all the fun things they do here with my little one.  It seems like she comes home weekly learning and saying something new.  I just love it!  And the teachers and staff here are OUTSTANDING!  You can tell they genuinely care for your child and not sure how, but everyone knows her by name, office staff and other teachers she&apos;s never had.  \\n\\nI will add, no one paid me to write this, just an honest review because I know how hard it is to find GREAT childcare.  I think I toured over half of them in the area and if it&apos;s not the BEST then it&apos;s not for my little one.  Thanks Cadence staff for being so great!!",

From the moment we walked in, we felt the warmth, care, and professionalism that encompass the entire center. Annalyn, the director has done a wonderful job getting to know all the students and families and making us all feel welcome and part of the Cadence family. Any questions or concerns I&apos;ve had have been immediately answered or addressed. \\nAll of the teachers have great attitudes and genuinely care about their students. They provide plenty of one on one time throughout the day, and even extra TLC when needed. Miss Abbie, the lead infant teacher does a fantastic job and is passionate about her babies. She has worked with my twins through several transitions already and continues to teach them new skills everyday. We would love for her to move to toddlers with them!\\n\\nOverall, Cadence Academy is a top notch school in Rogers and comes highly recommended. I don&apos;t know how anyone could have anything negative to say about this school and the staff!",

Nodin has been with this location for about 4 months now. He&apos;s 2 1/2 and an only child. We moved here from Denver in August and it hasn&apos;t been the easiest transition for him. Enrolling him at La petite Bentonville Ar. has been the one of the best choices as parents we&apos;ve made. We recently started potty training and genuinely had no idea how much work time and stress can accompany that life change. Our son who has always slept through the night started getting up multiple times each night as he curiously wanting to grasp this new toilet concept. I more often than not drop him off at La Petite Academy after having had almost no sleep  and every morning Whitney and I go over his progress and she gives suggestions and tips I would not know otherwise. She is completely dedicated to every child in the building and having someone to answer my questions, tactically make me aware of potential mistakes, while still making me feel validated as a mother has truly been a blessing. I trust her and the staff completely while my son is i their care  and to me that&apos;s priceless.",

More importantly, very few who are as tolerant, inclusive, and focused on raising children to honor peace and civility and to appreciate the natural world around them.\\n\\nMontessori is not daycare. It is not even your traditional school. Children at Walnut Farm are empowered to do things for themselves, and to study that which interests them most. In addition to several well appointed Montessori classrooms they also have a few unique features such as an outdoor classroom where children are learning life skills including gardening and caring for animals. The school also has a natural playground with features literally carved from the forested hillside.\\n\\nI see my little boy growing into a confident, warm, caring, and intelligent young man at Walnut Farm. He loves to read and do math. He is fascinated by and in love with every kind of animal. He loves his teachers and his classmates. \\n\\nWhen kids reach school age, we rely on the school to mold them into the people we want them to be. Schools have the kids from 8 to 3 most days, leaving just 4 or 5 hours with their parents. If they are going to play that big a role in the development of my child... then I feel strongly about choosing a school that not only does a good job educating my child, but also teaches him to grow up tolerant of the many differences in people around the world. \\n\\nThey take children from toddlers through around the equivalent of 6th grade.",

            "description": "We moved from California over a year ago. My daughter has been attending Walnut Farm as a preschooler for the present school year. We absolutely love the school and it&apos;s staff. The teachers are truly special and amazing! They are witty, kind, knowledgable,compassionate, creative, and have such a wealth of experience. We have a lot of experience with having been through 6 preschools between both of my kids. We love the involvement with nature and the lack of electronics in the school. My daughter learned to read in the past year, and her confidence is amazing. She has also learned great conflict resolution skills (communication) and real life skills (ex: setting/clearing the table). This school has a great peaceful &amp; positive enviornment  that is very welcoming. I am so grateful that they are here!",

We wanted a place where his natural curiosity can be fostered. We wanted a place where tolerance, acceptance, and peace are just a natural part of the day. \\n\\nNot only is he receiving core curriculum (reading, writing, math, science), but he is exposed to rich extras such as Spanish, nature education, life skills, art, and music. Children learn to investigate and research from a very young age. The learning is sparked by interest - so the child is more invested in it. \\n\\nThe Montessori method truly is remarkable and Walnut Farm does a lovely job of presenting an authentic experience. The classrooms - both indoor and outdoor - are led by caring, passionate teachers where the students are encouraged to engage with the lessons. They are empowered to learn and given the necessary tools to do so.\\n\\nIf you have a child between 18 months and 12 years and want more than just a traditional education, consider a visit to Walnut Farm. It is my greatest hope that you see what my family saw the very first time we set foot on the campus.",

It really gives the children freedom to explore what interests them and therefore stretches their attention and learning.  They have an outdoor classroom with a teacher outside at all times for instruction.  I think that is amazing!  There are two trained teachers in each room.  They offer Spanish, art, and life skills along with your typical school subjects.  We are very happy with the school and so is our child.",

They&apos;re essentially selling a product they don&apos;t have. Granted the place must be good if they&apos;re always full, but they completely lack integrity when it comes to getting new families to sign up. We paid the $100 registration fee and were told that they would have an opening in a few months. We&apos;ve waited for more than a year and still haven&apos;t gotten in. I tried to work with them on getting my money back before posting anything, but it doesn&apos;t matter that they blatantly sold me on something they don&apos;t have. The only thing that matters to them is the contract I had signed which protects them from their dishonesty.",

            "description": "I&apos;ll apologize ahead of time for my lengthy review; however, I feel it&apos;s necessary to provide in depth details of my negative experience with hopes it could possibly help another family considering using this company for their infant care needs. \\n\\nI&apos;ll start off by offering some general advice for any potential customer considering using  Virginia is for Doulas. First and foremost, I would most definitely consider getting a written description of what a doula can or cannot do. The scope of my needs stayed relatively constant over a period of a few months. Unfortunately, Tiffany (the owner) changed her mind several times as to what her doulas could or could not do and as a result, we had to look for help elsewhere at the last minute. As mentioned, this changed several times based on Tiffany changing her mind alone.  \\n\\nSecondly, a written copy of their sick policy is a must. Decide on whether you want your infant/child exposed to a sick doula. In our particular case, our son is a preemie. We verbally requested that any sick doulas should stay home to avoid any issues for our son and his weakened immune system. Our doula was sick and our pediatrician recommended that she not return to work until 48 hours had passed after starting antibiotics. Tiffany still charged us for those particular days of our doula being sick. Even after, our doulas health continued to decline and she had to miss work for almost a week. Clearly it was a terrible idea for her to work due to her own sickness, let alone work around an infant with a weakened immune system to begin with. As a result, our entire family got sick that ended in multiple doctor visits and medications just from being exposed to our sick doula.  \\n\\nAnother clarification that is extremely important is what happens when your doula can&apos;t come into work. Not only limited to being sick but for any reason they can&apos;t make it to work. On multiple occasions my family was left in a predicament where fill-in support was not provided. There were several instances where we never even received a text, phone call or email from Tiffany or anyone for that matter about the status of finding a replacement. We had to sign up with a completely different agency that could provide back-up help for our family at the last minute.  \\n\\nAside from all the frustrations listed above, the lack of professionalism on Tiffany&apos;s part was the most unsettling of all. I&apos;m a fairly open-minded person. I realize mistakes happen. No one is perfect. However, I wasn&apos;t expecting Tiffany&apos;s unprofessionalism with regards to my genuine concerns. I was caught off guard by her rudeness and condescending attitude as if I had no reason to be upset. In many responses from Tiffany directly, it was almost as if I was being blamed or at fault for how those given situations were handled and I was offended. Both my husband and I have 25+ years of consulting experience with a strong background in client management and customer service. Tiffany could benefit from improving the way she handles interpersonal communication with her long-term clients. While she was cordial and pleasant for the first few months, over time her attitude went from pleasant to disrespectful and ill-mannered in all forms of communication. Not something you&apos;d expect from the owner of the company. Her behavior and way of handling certain situations caused me to want to cut ties with her on many occasions, but I remained a long-term client because of one particular doula named Summer. \\n\\nWe adored Summer because of her compassion, her knowledge and her love for what she does and for all the babies she cares for. Had it not been for Summer, we wouldn&apos;t have remained clients for as long as we did. \\n\\nI&apos;m hoping this review will help anyone who reads it and is considering going the route of hiring a doula and using this particular company. I&apos;m simply being honest about my family&apos;s personal experience and I genuinely wouldn&apos;t want anyone else to be put in some of the situations we were or be spoken to in the manner that we did.",

            "description": "If you&apos;re pregnant and in the market for a doula for your upcoming delivery, I highly recommend Virginia is for Doulas. Tiffany and her team are extremely knowledgable and were helpful and supportive during my entire pregnancy through the delivery and post partum. I researched and considered other doulas in the area, but booked them after my initial phone consult because Tiffany was so friendly and informed, I knew I&apos;d be in good hands. I ended up having an emergency early induction and was so glad to have Tiffany as my doula providing pain relief and support during what could have been a scary delivery - thanks to her help, my baby was born smoothly and I recovered faster than I did with my first child.\\n\\nThe package we chose also included birth photography and follow up birth announcement photo shoot; other doulas try to double as birth photographer but I&apos;m glad they provided a separate photographer so the doula can focus without having to multitask. My photos came out beautifully and I&apos;m glad we&apos;ll always have them to remember this special time. My husband and I also attended the birth expo they hosted which was informative and full of freebies. If we have another baby, I will definitely book them again in the future! Thank you Tiffany!",

Kara and Tiffany were my doula teammates, and I had the great fortune that both of them were able to attend the birth. I had been fairly apprehensive about being able to VBAC but with the support of my team I did it, with a 8 lb baby, no less. Having the kind of triumphant birth I did made for a much better transition to new motherhood than with my first (emergency c-section). Our family is complete but if I were pregnant again I would hire the VIFD team again in a heartbeat.",

They helped us with postpartum care for our newborn twins many nights a week when I only got a few weeks off work.  I highly suggest them, especially for parents of multiples.  I have NO IDEA what we would have done without them!  Professional, well-run business with compassionate staff we felt very comfortable having in our home.  The added bonus of lactation help if you run into issues.  They came highly recommend to us.",

Heather and Jessica provided great info during the pregnancy and we enjoyed getting to know them. Long store short, my water started leaking at 35 weeks and I was induced. Heather was on call and was there for most of my labor. I ended up with an epidural - had I known this up front we would never have hired a doula service but realize now how nice it was having Heather there. She was able to provide lots of information, but also was another friend in the room. The whole process with Virginia is for Doulas was amazing - I would highly recommend them to anyone!",

            "description": "I cannot say enough about what a great place Briarwood was for our kids.   The teachers, the director, and all the staff are kind, loving, patient, skilled, creative and super-accommodating. We had a previous daycare that treated our daughter very poorly, and the result was she was untrusting of teachers and acting out. When I came to Briarwood, I had a long talk about her situation with Miss Kelly, the director, and instantly knew that things would be much better here. Her teacher at Briarwood was so loving and gentle that she won her over right away, and turned her whole life around. (Wonderful Miss Ashley, who has since gone back to teaching elementary school.) Our daughter went from a kid who hated school and didn&apos;t trust authority to one who is a cooperative, eager learner who looks forward to school and loves her teachers.  Our son was struggling with potty training at home, but when he moved into preschool, Miss Kayla expertly got him going right away, and acted as if it were no work at all! Her art projects are unbelievable, too. Our son just loved her! Both my kids LOVED the monthly, themes learning in depth about a different country, an author, a musician and an artist each month. My 3-year-old is still obsessed with Zimbabwe and wants to visit it. The teachers all were great, and they maintain a good balance of free play, structured activity and academics for each age level. \\n\\nAmong the many things I love about Briarwood is that they are fantastic and efficient with communication. The kids&apos; art and work came home daily along with plenty of info about what they were working on. Monthly newsletters, email weekly or whenever anything came up. And they make things easy on parents -- you can sign up to have your tuition paid by EFT, so there&apos;s no remembering checks every week. Before COVID, lunch and snacks were even included! Never any hassles about when you needed to pick up a kid early or drop off late. I&apos;ve used daycares that act as though you are lucky they let you use their services, and you&apos;d better adjust to their rules or you can take your business elsewhere. Briarwood isn&apos;t like that; they understand that working parents need flexibility, and they handle everything that comes up with grace and kindness. This is not a place where you will be bombarded with notes about every negative thing your kid may have done through the day. They&apos;ll tell you what you need to know, but they also understand that kids are developing people, and they are your partner in helping them develop.\\n\\nThe facility is awesome. They have an indoor gym (called the gross motor room, and it still makes me laugh to hear my kids say that), TONS of room and large, airy classrooms that are well-lit, well-maintained and stocked with great stuff. In the summer, the waterplay areas are top-notch. The playgrounds are good, too. \\n\\nI would also say the teachers here are more experienced, have less turnover and are just overall much happier than at the other daycares we&apos;re been in. It makes a big difference when the staff is happy. The environment is relaxed, peaceful and conducive to learning, and the kids are more comfortable and happier. \\n\\nI am not exaggerating when I say that our experience at Briarwood changed our whole family&apos;s life. They gave our kids the love and understanding they&apos;d been missing at their previous daycare, as well as a calmer, more supportive atmosphere. They replaced the constant anxiety we felt with our previous daycare with a sense of peace, since we knew our kids were being treated well and were learning and developing. \\n\\nWe left only because we don&apos;t live in North Smithfield, and when our daughter started kindergarten, there was no transportation from her school two towns away. It broke our hearts, because we just loved everything about Briarwood. We all miss it!",

            "description": "Our toddler has been enrolled part time for three months now and loves it. The facility is large, including an indoor gym play area as well as a nice outdoor playground. The classrooms are roomy and well organized. They have toddler-sized toilets and lowered sinks to make teaching hygiene skill easier. Each student has a cubby in the hallway for their jackets and change of clothes as well as a folder in their classroom that will contain their art projects or communications from the staff. The teachers are so friendly and clearly enjoy working with kids. They serve meals from the restaurant next door but are also happy to give them any food you send from home instead. There is a free online service they use to provide updates throughout the day which usually describe when they were changed, when they ate, how much, and sometimes even pictures or a short description of their day. They are also active on Facebook with general news and pictures that help parents feel more connected. The director recently changed from Kim to Kelly, and I&apos;m not sure if that impacts some of the older negative reviews on here. Kelly and another gentlemen run this daycare and seem to be very organized, communicative (via email usually weekly), and flexible. At this time I don&apos;t have anything negative to say about the facility or staff at Briarwood and would wholeheartedly recommend enrolling your toddler here.",

            "description": "SMOKE AND MIRRORS DAYCARE; \\nTerrible daycare! The only thing that this place has going for it, is the splash pad in the back and the gross motor skills room for the kids. My son was there from three months to three years old, so I didn&apos;t feel comfortable pulling him since that&apos;s all he knew, Fortunately at one point we couldn&apos;t afford it and had to pull him and it was the best thing we did. The girls there have absolutely no training with children, except for the head teacher, which they are barely with. Towards the end of his last year, They put him on a three strike policy, multiple times. On the third strike he would be kicked out. Since I had no back up plan and I am a full time working mom,  I did anything I could to keep him there. Which meant sending him to the Providence Center, and I knew in my heart, was not right for him. Those children that attend there have deep emotional issues; which my son is just a typical three-year-old who is a little rambunctious and needed more one-on-one attention and redirection. Long story short the girls there have zero training with children and should be in no means in charge of these kids, their prices are totally outrageous , you are pretty much paying high school/college girls to watch your children during the day with no training. Last but not least, the daycare was not clean, it would smell of dirty diapers every time I would pick up my son up at the  end of the day, I never saw them wiping down the tables or the  toys. Wait no, I take that back,there were a couple of times my son came home with bleach stains on his clothing. So I&apos;m assuming they were cleaning the rooms down b4 the kids were picked up and not keeping them away from the chemicals afterwards. Not to mention my son was sick multiple, multiple times while he was there. One time he had to be hospitalized. Needless to say, he is now attending a great daycare in the woonsocket area and is doing GREAT! The teachers there couldn&apos;t understand why he was sent to the Providence Center.They enjoy his company and said his behavior is nothing but a typical 3 year old who just needs a little redirecting from TRAINED staff! I am a first time mom, so all this was new to me and I thought was normal for a daycare facility this large. I wish I knew what I know now, I would have never allowed him to attend there, let alone let them take  thousands of dollars of my hard earned money! PARENTS BEWARE!",

Both are bringing home projects, artwork, and telling me about what they&apos;ve learned that day whether it be about a new country, the weather, or (as was the case yesterday) how they learned to make a party hat. I&apos;ve picked my kids up, (who are 3 and 6) and in the car they discussed foods they&apos;ve cooked, foreign language words they&apos;ve learned, and how much fun they had playing games outside as a group.\\n\\nThe staff is dedicated to the well-being of the children and they keep the parents informed regarding even the slightest of issues. For example, my daughter ran into another kid, it happens (she&apos;s 3). There was no bruise or cut yet the teacher as well as staff member informed me of the incident. They didn&apos;t have to as I would have never known, but it again reaffirmed the notion that they will do what is right over what is easy.\\n\\nAs a father and Veteran I am protective of my family and I trust this company with the care of my two children. Their professionalism as well as &apos;family oriented&apos; atmosphere can be clearly seen through the many activities put on by the company such as Halloween party and charity events along with the mental growth the children experience. \\n\\nAt the end of the day it comes down to two things for me in regards to the quality of the daycare my children are attending:\\n\\n1) I feel that my children are safe and in a controlled environment.\\n\\n2) That my children are better prepared for entering their next grade level in school.\\n\\nBriarwood Child Academy is consistently setting the mark in both of these regards and therefore I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a place to send their kids.",

            "description": "We moved my daughter to Briarwood Child Academy a little over a year ago.  It was the best decision we could have made for her.  She went from being extremely shy with a distaste for going to &quot;school&quot; to a child who is excited every day to go see her friends and teachers.  She has improved both academically and socially.  \\n\\nHer teachers as well as the other staff at Briarwood have always made themselves available to discuss any concerns I have had or to answer my questions.\\n\\nEven when we moved away from North Smithfield, we kept our daughter at Briarwood.  I just can&apos;t imagine moving her away from somewhere that we love so much.",

            "description": "Don&apos;t do it, please find another place. They are ok at best and your kid deserves better, it&apos;s in a plaza with a gym so the parking is horrendous, the security is poor as everyone allows piggybacking and there&apos;s not always an employee near the entrance to notice, and the gross motor room has a dangerous 2-story slide meant for older kids that I&apos;ve seen kids sneak past the foam barricade to get to. \\n\\nWe started sending our son after a trusted recommendation; they&apos;ve since removed their child from attendance and have apologized profusely to us. I&apos;d say I&apos;m surprised to see the positive reviews but I&apos;m not, there was a big hoopla about the great prizes you could win if you posted a positive review on Yelp in October and November, even with email reminders. \\n\\nWe were given a tour and weren&apos;t entirely sold on the place, the teachers dressed like teenagers and did not inspire confidence and the rooms seemed so small, but again we had a trusted recommendation. Our son joined the toddler program. I quickly noticed he was moved from toddler rooms frequently as I&apos;d have to hunt in other classrooms for him at pickup; I did not like the inconsistent teacher/room relationship but this is how they balance the child/teacher ratio - bouncing. They send home a daily sheet for your child, usually, however you cant rely on it we learned. You&apos;ll notice it&apos;s often a form that&apos;s been filled out once and photo copied with names hand written later. I noticed it was inaccurate at times; one time for the lunch it was handwritten that my son ate the snack brought from home - except we did not send him with a snack so who&apos;s form did we have? Speaking of food, my son is a picky eater. We supplemented his last daycares menu with snacks but were quickly told not to because he ate fine, despite always being very hungry at pickup. I should&apos;ve paid more attention there. The meals arent really nutritious, more like what an Uncle might serve. Our son moved into the preschool program. At first we were happy, he suddenly seemed to enjoy going everyday and we actually saw the teachers teaching, not just supervising. A teacher talked to us about his communication, he&apos;s behind there, and encouraged us to get speech therapy; wow she notices and cares we think. A teacher says our son hardly eats anything they give him so we start sending snacks, that go unused so we dont believe they were offered. We notice the gross motor room change, it&apos;s slammed pack with preschoolers and very chaotic. Turns out they put all the preschoolers together while reducing the number of teachers (as the law allows) whereas toddlers was done in smaller groups of kids. My son was not prepared for this and found it too loud and too active for his comfort, reacting poorly to provocation and an occasional biting problem became regular. The incident reports are poorly done, lacking detail sometimes lacking entire sections. The teachers would tell us a whole story at pickup and it was disappointing that those details werent documented. Just recently we were verbally told that he reacted to being kicked by another child but we were not given an injury report to sign because biting was more severe. \\n\\nWe were concerned parents, we started reading books to him about biting and even supplied the school with copies as they had no such literature, we talked to him about it at length, and we did not have a biting problem with him at home or with friends/family. We told the teachers please call us if he&apos;s having a bad day, we&apos;d rather pick him up early than have a problem persist; never called. We suggested picking him up before gross motor time to avoid the situation but teachers advised against it, that he&apos;d adjust in time. We asked several times if this repeat behavior was severe enough to have him &quot;disenrolled&quot; and every time told that we&apos;d be advised well ahead of time and we werent near that happening (as recently as last week we were told). What a relief, our second child is due in 2 weeks and who&apos;d want disenrollment sprang on them then right? Except that&apos;s what they did today, he did have another incident today. Just like that, no notice or warning, not even a hint from a teacher that the problem was actually severe or action was imminent. I think that&apos;s what bothered me the most. Until the emotional reaction subsided and I thought about how we&apos;ve already started the search to find him a new preschool anyways, they just upped the timeline. We do know we&apos;re better off not sending our son there, the flags were obvious.",

My 15 month old is more than happy to go to his Infant room in the morning and play with the other babies. They work on letters and colors and shapes, adorable art projects, as well as music and movement, and he has developed so much and learned so much thanks to the many teachers working with him there. \\n\\nMy 3 year old learns so much in the preschool class as well! He has learned things like sign language, yoga, Spanish, authors, countries, and I really like how each week and each month has a different theme that the lessons are based on so parents can follow along at home. On top of that they reinforce the basics of letters, numbers, counting, music, reading, etc, and again, they do the best art projects!\\n\\nI also really like how for both kids play and outdoor activity is built into every day. They have really great outdoor play areas for different age groups, a splash park for summer, and a large indoor gross motor/play room for bad weather. On top of all that the meals that are included are healthy and well rounded and suitable for even the younger babies. And all of the teachers that I have met there are so nice, and so patient. I was also very impressed that even just after a month of going teachers I had never seen knew my sons&apos; names and would greet them in the halls as we would come in or out. You can tell the teachers there really care about the kids. We have been nothing but happy with Briarwood for both my infant and preschooler!",

We were convinced to stay by their owner and it was a mistake. After being told by her teacher that she was one of the children that she did not have to worry about, she was transferred to a new class with a teacher who I can only assume is not able to do her job. All of the friends she had in class were put in one class and she was put in another.This is when we were told that she had become such a problem they abandoned her and kicked her out within 2 weeks. This was after we were given a phone number to call by the director for children who are acting out and to help them cope. Turns out it was for children that have been diagnosed with Mental Disorders. Excuse me! They do not know how to handle children. They go through directors like toilet paper and the director they have now is in over her head. I have spoken with former staff members since and they have told me how bad the school actually was and that we are lucky to no longer be there. Keep your kids away.",

I can&apos;t say thank you enough to the teachers he&apos;s had in both the infant and toddler room.  When he first started in the infant room he would cry at drop off, which is obviously hard for a parent.  It made it easier when I saw them embracing and snuggling him.  He also has asthma and they are very attentive to his needs.  He used to need a nebulizer and they were well educated on how to use it and noted if they did use it on his daily sheet.  I also love their curriculum.  My son came home and I overheard him saying his numbers in Spanish and that wasn&apos;t something we had gone over.  They have music, culinary, and gym class weekly.  The director is also amazing.  You walk in the door and she greets each adult and child by name.  She is also in the classrooms on a daily basis and not just in the office.  Overall we&apos;re had a great experience!",

Now my parents never let me try out for the company team which was upsetting because I was missing out but the worst part was that unless you&apos;re in company there wasn&apos;t much of an effort to get you involved in the studio or to strengthen your skills.

As a former day care worker, I see more positive in this center than most others I have visited.  No center is perfect because we all parent differently.  I can imagine that the previous poster was upset by the fact that her child was meant to abide by rules - rules that are set forth so that a large group of children can get along and work together.\\n\\nEveryone that I have met has been kind, caring, and helpful.  Not every personality works with every child, and not every child works well with every program.  If your child is &quot;tough&quot;, you may be asked to seek alternative care.  \\n\\nBTW - not to take shots, but I would not really believe the opinion of a person who rated the RI DMV as five-stars.

Other days they push her to be the energetic/smart little girl she can be at this age. I&apos;ve seen her vocabulary, sign language, social skills, fine motor skills, and much more surpass most kids her age.  Every morning at drop off she runs to the director to give her a hug. And again in the afternoon at pickup. I&apos;ve surprised the facility and picked up during nap time to find the director in the toddler room rubbing backs to help them fall asleep. These girls go above and beyond because they love what they do. Taking care of this many little ones can&apos;t be easy and yet they light up when they see the kids in the morning. I feel so grateful to have found this place and to know my kids are in good hands while I&apos;m at work is well with the price.",

I was nervous and worried to send him, but the team at Dr Daycare Smithfield was understanding, sensitive, and handled all my questions (I had tons!). My son started at 1 year old and my Step Daughter also went through the entire daycare.  Now she is in Kindergarten and is learning to read and write at a fast pace. Not only does the daycare keep your kids safe and healthy with lots of exercise and playing - they also prepare them for school. My son comes home saying a new word everyday, and loves doing art projects. They even taught him how to blow his nose. His teachers Miss Jessica and Miss Kandace are incredible, and I consider them part of our family now. They have a special bond with my son and really care for him.  If you are skeptical and nervous to send your child to daycare. I hear you and I was you, but now I love this daycare and it is such a huge part of our lives. Also they follow all COVID guidelines as directed by the DOH and CDC. Always wearing masks and keeping everything disinfected and clean. I have had no concerns with their compliance. We all just want our kids to be safe!",

How they are still open and &quot;caring&quot; for children is beyond me, and it makes me SICK to my stomach for anybody who leaves their child here every single day. From first hand personal experience, your children are NOT SAFE here! They are not being nurtured AT ALL and they&apos;re definitely not being loved and cared for the way you would expect your child to be loved and cared for. Especially for the amount of money you are being charged for child care. \\nThe director and assistant are compulsive, pathological liars. Do not trust them. They will lie to your face about the safety and well being of your children. They lie to dcyf workers investigating complaints made by somebody other than the director herself (so a complaint made by an employee or family member). The male employee is put so high on a pedestal at the Smithfield location that he gets away with abusing children and it&apos;s considered &quot;okay&quot; by most employees because they are friends who go out drinking together, even with their administrators.\\nThe employees are &quot;supposedly&quot; mandatory reporters but they are told that they are better off reporting neglect and/or abuse right to the directors rather than to call DCYF on their own (yes, the director Danielle scares her employees into NOT making the call to dcyf) but when the reports are made right to her or her assistant, the allegations are ignored, not taken seriously, or not believed, and of course, swept under the rug.\\nINFANTS (6 weeks to 1 year) are grabbed by their LIMBS!!!! If they stand in their cribs, the nurturing care takers will grab your babies by the arms, slam them onto their stomachs and yell at them &quot;ENOUGH! GO TO SLEEP!&quot; Once a baby starts being able to wiggle and move around, they&apos;re able to bang on the sides of the cribs; the caring and nurturing teacher will grab them by a foot and yank them fast and hard away from the crib side. If a baby is having a hard time falling asleep, or if they typically cry at nap time, they will be forcefully rolled onto their belly and have their backs &quot;patted&quot; aka SMACKED SO HARD its surprising theres never any bruising. If the back smacking doesnt work, theyll literally be left in their crib screaming their head off for the entire two hours (usually more because theyll be the last to get taken out of their crib. Every other child will be removed one at a time and have their diaper changed first). According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (and probably dcyf regulations considering it&apos;s a daycare) babies aren&apos;t allowed to sleep on their stomachs unless they can roll to that position by themselves but at the Smithfield location, any baby having a hard time settling down is tossed onto their stomachs in hopes that they&apos;ll fall asleep quickly so the teacher can go stuff her face with food or wander the hallways or go interrupt other classrooms or go use her cell phone in a bathroom, all while leaving her own classrooms out of ratios for the entire two hour nap time (and theres more than one two hour nap each day)\\nParents are made to believe (by the directors) that  their kids are safe because of the multiple cameras placed in every classroom, yet administration does absolutely nothing about the wrongful things that are clearly taking place in all of these classrooms. \\nChildren at this location, if they soil their diaper in between one of the four regularly scheduled diaper changes, they will not be changed until one of those scheduled times. \\nI could go on and on for hours detailing the many reasons a parent should NOT send their child here, or why parents who currently have children here should REMOVE their child from this disgusting place.\\nAnd if we&apos;re being honest, that infant room is the very first classroom in the building. There&apos;s still a long hallway with many more classrooms and horror stories to mention. \\nTRUST MY WORD: As a parent, if something, ANYTHING, does not feel right, I promise you from the bottom of my heart IT IS NOT RIGHT!",

I know every single teacher that care for my son personally. They keep me updated on every little thing that happens in my sons day. The admin team up front are so protective over the children and would do anything to ensure your child is safe! At any point I have a concern it&apos;s address immediately and it never happens again. I love this daycare and the teachers!",

Dorms very clean and organized, all buildings look new; innovative businesses center. They have a job service center on campus that places students with jobs. I was impressed with the layout and organization. Activities seem to be frequent to keep students busy (and out of trouble ). They have a bulldog as a mascot who walks the grounds with his caretaker. Very cute seeing the students fawn over him and take selfies. I must end on how incredibly clean and beautiful this campus is.",

In fact they didn&apos;t  teach well at all.  One professor had taken the liberty to brag about himself by passing out his resume (which listed his GPA as a former student of Bryant) along with the syllabus.  He made a better student than teacher.  ACE is horrible and they are more concerned with talking to thier friends than tutoring.  Academic advisors to be very lazy to the core and the one I had always sounded like I woke her up from a sound sleep.  To top it off education was very poor.  In fact I often heard &quot;I didn&apos;t learn anything in this class&quot; from others in the class.  Let&apos;s not forget the price.  Very high to put up with this.  I, too, included Bryant on my resume while attending.  While I had sent a few out, no one had ever called.  Don&apos;t let Bryant fool you.  They are not as good as they say.  In fact I feel they rip students off.",

Prices are extreme for under 42&quot;, at $7 and above 42&quot; is $8. WTH? Only $1 for kids?  Would be better if there was another tier or a bigger gap between the two prices. Infants to 1yo are free. They offer military discount, so be sure to show your ID when you pay ($1 off admission).\\n\\nThere is a kiddie area, red slide that is todder friendly, diving board and two bigger slides (must be over 42&quot;), and a lazy river. \\n\\nPlenty of seating around the pools.\\n\\nBreak times are listed so you know when they will be telling everyone to get out for a rest break.\\n\\nSnack bar prices are a bit high, but straight forward, highest is $4, cheapest is $1. They have an off brand Dippin Dots, Icee, nachos, hot dog, chips, etc.",

All I know is they teach tumbling and floor exercises well. They teach her confidence and never put her down but they do push her to improve without being overbearing. I recommend this place. I have other daughters and never had any in gymnastics or cheerleading so I am not a professional here all I can say is I live in Benton and I have lived in other areas of Arkansas and enjoy this place. I don&apos;t live in Tx and Illinois so I can say my child actually goes here and likes it.",

This is the third college I&apos;ve been to and by far the worst. The biggest reason I am leaving such an awful review is the fact that the financial aid office has refused to process my fafsa unless my parents commit tax fraud. They were separate at the time but the school wants them to refile as married not separate. I also owe the school a bit of money since scholarships didn&apos;t cover enough and fafsa wasn&apos;t processed so I had to solely rely on that. So I got a loan but I was told it wouldn&apos;t be active until the first day of classes. That means yet again my attempt to relieve the hold and register for classes was a bust. Next up is the food, the cafeteria seems to constantly under cook food. More specifically the chicken is almost always raw. And third is the teachers, but most specifically an english teacher named Mrs. Carter. Who gave me numerous zeros for assignments I turned in without any explanation why causing me to go from a B to an F in the last few weeks of classes. All in all I do not recommend attending this university.",

Leaving my daughter here is like leaving her with family. I cloth diapered, sent breast milk, and now organic milk, and homemade baby food for my daughter with no complaints from them. The low turnover rate allows my child to feel comfortable going there and I can work without feeling worried or guilty. Days that I&apos;ve had to go to work early they adjust their schedule and took her earlier (as early as 5:30 a.m.).\\n\\nI would change nothing about this childcare center. Someone could offer me free childcare elsewhere and I would not take it. I&apos;ve tried every daycare in town, licensed in-home providers and babysitters. None compare to Bright Start. There aren&apos;t enough stars to rate how I feel about them!",

(I will update my rating after school starts up again.)  So far I like that the kids can come at any time on any or all of the five days that it is open and can get one-on-one help with tutors for the entire 1 hour session if they want it.  I also like that at the end of each session a progress report for each kid is provided to the parent which tells what the kids worked on, what they have accomplished and what they need to work on.  The kids get instant rewards for completing session work to keep them motivated, and also earn &quot;cards&quot; they can save up and exchange for prizes in the future.\\n\\nThe facility is always clean and orderly, and the people who work there are friendly and helpful.  If you have more than one kid enrolled at a time there is a discount on the others.  The owner is very nice and works with the kids as well.",

The grammar and spelling made it feel like my brain was walking across a field of sharpened Lego pieces. I mean, there&apos;s a spell checker on Yelp and most computers/phones that you would write a review on have spelling and grammar checks that would literally take less than a minute to complete. Anyway, the college here is best described as cows grazing in a field. They&apos;re eating and moving around but not really doing anything or going anywhere. There&apos;s a few professors here who are diamonds in the rough but most should have spent their education careers at a daycare thanks to their insatiable egos and apathy. I went here for my basics to stay close to friends and family but eventually got tired of the lazy administrative staff that could care less about whether you enroll or get benefits and moved on to a standard four-year for my BA. I actually had to pay for one of my semesters out of pocket because they incorrectly submitted my VA benefits in spite of me working with them. After speaking to several classmates over the year and change I was there, I came to realize that my experience was a pretty regular occurrence with many, not just vets. Never in my entire life have I seen employees who care so little about their job or their clients and will do anything to get out of doing work. Sure, you&apos;re greeted with a smile, a handshake, and some wonderful sounding promises, but behind all that shallow fluff, you&apos;re being dismissed in the minds of the faculty and staff.",

Although I know several of the people that attend this university, You were unable to see their faces because it was so dark, they had masks on and were painted up. We had to take a hayride into the &quot;woods&quot; (the haunted house was on campus) Then you had to get off and walk across the broken down bridge. Finally you get to the house, its all black and all you can see is flashing lights. Our tour guide told us to stay close and dont get lost. When we first walked in it was a guy just lying on a couch with a knife in hes chest. Pretty funny if you ask me, he was trying to be slick and scare everyone by waking up. You couldnt see where the hell you were going so I have no idea who or what was in front of me and suddenly SMACK a freaking doll hit me on the head. They had dolls hanging by there necks suspended from the ceiling. The next room that was lit up was of a women vampire, she didnt do anything but smile, so she sucked!! We went on this damn bus, I didnt even know we were on a bus till our tour guide yelled &quot;watch your step were getting off the bus now&quot;. What I was freakin out when the hell did I get on this bus???Next we went across another bridge and of course people were grabbing your legs, which was pretty funny because im so ticklish. But we get off the bridge and were in what looks to be a Forest, trees everywhere I lost my husband somewhere in the damn forest so im freaking out, IM LOST!! Suddenly all you could hear is roaring chainsaws all around me and Star,(my oldest daughter) as she had stayed with me.  They started chasing us, my daughter started screaming so I had to hold her all 40 pounds of her and make my way through this forest. Whomever it was they thought it was pretty funny and started poking me and her with the damn prop. Im not going to lie I was scared shit less. I should have gotten high before going in there!! Finally after running to catch up with my husband I fucking pushed him so hard into the damn wall, now that was funny!!!! I couldnt tell you what was after the forest because I just closed my eyes and hoped it would be coming to the end very soon. We finally got out of the house, and making our way back to the old ass bridge to cross that and go back on the hay ride one of the guys with the chainsaw started chasing me and Star again. He/She didnt go after my husband nor the others. My husband was rolling with laughter. So im wondering if it was someone we knew. He wont tell me. But it was pretty fun.. Worth the trip down there to see!",

Both my children have attended since its beginning, then we moved and they attended an excellent public school for one year in Virginia. When we found out we could move back to the area if we wanted (while the husband went over seas) there was no hesitation to do so.  A HUGE reason we made this decision was because of Little Scholars.  They are very caring and professional.  The class sizes are not found in any other school in the area and each child gets personal instruction designed for their learning needs/level.  I have asked both my children which school setting they liked better and they both agreed they preferred little scholars but didn&apos;t dislike public schools. (Being perfectly honest) as a parent I know without a doubt they are getting a far superior education than they would be getting at any public school.   This school does mix in traditional school with Montessori and I love that fact.  Most will move from the Montessori setting on to a more traditional setting (like we did for one year) and these children will have little if any issues transitioning.  Neither of my children had any problems adjusting to the public school routine and then adjusting back to Montessori.  \\n\\nI am a very happy parent and would recommend Little Scholars to anyone with an interest in developing foundations for future learning to check them out.",

They learned about different cultures and customs and became aware of our world. I am so happy that they received such a strong base to begin their education! I highly recommend this school!

The teachers are &quot;Ok&quot; as most are only there to get money and leave and don&apos;t care, but there is a few that stand out, such as the librarians or the extra curricular teachers. Ive caught students having sex in the bathrooms with weed, vapes, cigarettes. The food is absolutely horrible as is they serve nacho cheese the cheese is a solid, and the bread is hard as a brick, the pizza horrible and its sauce is brown and not even close to red",

            "description": "I would attend just about any school before going here, and here&apos;s why: \\n\\nIf you&apos;re considering going to Miller-Motte in order to make a better future for yourself, please do as much research as possible. Not all schools are created equally nor are the instructors who ultimately hold huge sway in the likelihood of your success. A lot of reviewers take time to discuss accreditation. This review is not going to be one of them, but that&apos;s an important topic as well considering that many reviewers attempted to transfer credit earned at MMTC to another school and were unable to do so. Please check into where you can take your credits, especially if you are Military personnel or a dependent and are going to relocate prior to your graduation. \\n\\nI attended their massage therapy school and initially felt good about that decision. \\nThe people who were responsible for enrolling me were kind and helpful and seemed to be genuinely interested in the success of their students. It wasn&apos;t until I was well into the program that I began to second guess everything. \\n\\nFirst off, the scheduling for the LMT students is extremely inflexible. If you have a full time job and are the primary breadwinner of your household, you&apos;re gonna have a bad time (quoting the South Park meme, here). The reason for this is is because the classes run from about 8 in the morning until between 2 p.m. and 7:30 at night. You will be going at a minimum of 6 hours/day 5 days/week and depending on the class will be given ample amounts of homework, making this essentially a full time job. This is doable if you have a lot of grant/loan money to make up the difference for missed work while you&apos;re in the program or have a spouse who can support you while you&apos;re completing the program, but if you are already working a 50 hour a week job, have nobody to help you and are a single parent doing all of this, you will struggle. \\n\\nI won&apos;t mention names, but I met at least a couple of women who were working minimum wage jobs full time as single parents who had to drop out, were sleeping in class because of the grueling schedules they kept and who not only had no support from the faculty, but who were bad-mouthed in class by their instructors to other students. I witnessed this firsthand; the instructors were ridiculing these students during class and were marking down their grades with little to no explanation. \\n\\nTwo instructors who work at the Clarksville, TN campus, one of which still works there, were particularly problematic. It didn&apos;t matter how much you applied yourself, how dedicated you were as a student: if they didn&apos;t like you as a person, you would get D&apos;s and C&apos;s. You would get disciplined for anything and everything while other students whom they liked slept during class, came in late, and acted generally disrespectful. I realize that some students don&apos;t take their education seriously and deserve the low GPA, but I&apos;m not talking about these people. There is a genuine lack of professionalism with Miller-Motte&apos;s faculty and I would go so far as to call some of the instructors bullies. \\n\\nFor example: one woman in our Swedish Massage class was called out for needing to use the bathroom &quot;too often&quot;; the same instructor made sarcastic, snide comments in front of us over anything and everything she did. If she did what every other student does and had a snack in class, she was called out for it. If she was late like every other student was from time to time, she suffered more serious consequences. When the director was informed, she tried to help, but it was impossible to convey the seriousness of what was happening when it was so hard to prove. But we saw what was going on; we just kept our heads down and said nothing because we were afraid of our GPAs being affected. \\n\\nAnother instructor made a huge scene over a student over god knows what; she said she &quot;felt disrespected&quot; by them, but they were being quiet in class, doing their work, and didn&apos;t say much. Apparently, it was the fact that she &quot;wasn&apos;t providing enough feedback in class&quot; that irked the instructor, so for the remainder of the year, she was targeted for arbitrary and completely irrelevant reasons. \\nThis, again, while the more favored students could be late, loud and inconsiderate, have their late attendance overlooked and so on. \\n\\nI tried to take my complaints to Academic Affairs after the stress of being in such an unhealthy, unprofessional environment began to take its toll on my ability to even focus in class, but was dismissed largely because I wasn&apos;t directly involved. Now that I&apos;m licensed and out of there, however, I feel like I have an obligation to speak out so that others who spend thousands of dollars and invest so much time, energy and effort to try and build a better future for themselves aren&apos;t jeopardized. Avoid this school if you can.",

Pinot&apos;s has so many other options that other paint events &amp; places at comparable prices. They even have a truck to take things mobile.

But I was lucky to have the opportunity to stumble upon PlayArts for my friends&apos; daughter 1st birthday party yesterday. The building of PlayArts is interesting as it used to be a historical public bath but it&apos;s converted into a children&apos;s activity center. The entrance to PlayArts on Front Street was a bit confusing as I had to go to the back entrance on Lee Street. But the staff didn&apos;t really communicate it properly and I had to call my friends who were hosting the event for directions to the birthday party entrance. The back entrance for the event has multiple shoe cubbies where you can put your shoes in. Then I entered a spacious room which was where the birthday party was in with a very long picnic table and birthday decor. What was very notable for me was seeing staff interactions with the children and how kind, genuine, and engaged they were with the child attendees in the birthday party. PlayArts seems like a great spacious place to customize into any theme and definitely is a great place to host events for children! Thanks PlayArts :)",

I&apos;ve been wanting to attend a drop in play session for a while, but when PlayArts held a special mini photo session in collaboration with a local photographer, and free play after the photos, I jumped on the deal!\\n\\nWhile not part of the normal business operations, the mini photo session was amazing - in a private room in the back, plenty of time for my daughter to feel comfortable and get a number of amazing photos. \\n\\nThen we moved to the play space and let my toddler go wild! The space is truly safe and entertaining for crawling babies through older elementary aged kids, with areas only the older kids could access and plenty to keep the younger kids entertained. We spent a solid hour, my child had a ball, and she was exhausted and took a loooong nap afterwards. \\n\\nI&apos;m so happy we have a space like this in Fishtown, and we look forward to more playtime!\\n\\nThey also are available to hold private parties, and it&apos;s definitely a space I&apos;ll consider as my child gets older and we have parties with other kids attending.",

With exposed brick and some new skylights, the inside is airy and bathed in light even on a rainy day. The interior is well conceived and has a very modern Scandinavian industrial esthetic with a couple thin bright neon metal trees perched in the main play space.\\n\\nThere are at least a dozen separate play spaces with duplos, train tracks, dress up, magna-tiles, fuzzy green &apos;grass&apos; reading nook, little trikes, play kitchen, climbing castle and a two floor play house, along with a little crawling hideaway. The toys on the whole, seemed to be sourced part Etsy, part Ikea, part Melissa and Doug, along with tons of European imports like HAPE and Plan toys.\\n\\nThere&apos;s a classroom in the back for classes, parties and a variety of specific kiddo activities. There are entrances both at the front and back of the building and there is an observation elevated space dedicated for snacking, for working and most importantly, for coffee drinking. The snack/coffee area is on an honor system (which I love - yes, we are adults!), offers a variety of kid friendly snacks (not just junk, unless you consider pirate booty, junk? ha!) beverages, along with Perrier and coffee (did I mention, there was coffee?)  Yes, there is coffee. Thank god.\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, the place is packed on weekends and especially on rainy days. As far as the age group it appeals to, my preschooler finds it lots of fun, although the majority of the population that I have observed in there is younger.  When the space is in fully over-run, staff could make efforts to better organize the space, and there should be perhaps labels as to what&apos;s where, or where things should go? (would that ruin the whole look?) The house and castle have some perilous stairs/ladders that require more parents oversight (helicoptering?) than I would like and I wish there was a tumbling section or a little climbing wall so we could really tire the kiddos out. Without a membership, you are out $12 per walk-in visit per kid. Much better play space than the underground Nest downtown.",

And PlayArts nails it. From the moment you walk in, you&apos;re greeted in a nice, clean reception area by PlayArts personnel who explain to you the concept, the rules of play, and the pricing scale. We initially decided to visit just for the day, but midway through our visit, I decided to go with a monthly plan. The kids had that much fun.\\n\\nHighlights include: tons of interactive toys, play areas for older toddlers as well as kids as young as a few months old, cool seating areas for parents, the snack/coffee/tea mezzanine area, the cash-free policy, etc.\\n\\nThis past summer, we held our son&apos;s birthday party here as well. And it was awesome. Both the kids and parents had a great time. I could base my 5-star review entirely on the party because it was that excellent of an experience: from booking, to communication with PA staff, to the execution the day-of. I have a feeling it won&apos;t be our last party there!",

After coming here a few times I decided that we had to become members! I&apos;m so glad I did. The first fridays are awesome and it&apos;s BYOB so you get to have a few drinks while watching your little run wild lol! Very clean, welcoming and relaxed environment. The staff are always friendly and welcoming to my family. Usually when we go we&apos;re there all day and when it&apos;s time to leave my son has a fit! So glad I found this place. No charge for parents which I think is awesome! And for former Chesnut hill Nest members (they recently closed down and I thought my world would end) this place is awesome. With winter quickly approaching and having a very rambunctious 2 year old little man this will be our new home and I am very happy about that! Thank you Play Arts! You da bomb!!",

            "description": "This review is about hosting a birthday party there. The good: play space is spacious and fun with good music; can do a private rental. The bad: for all the money we paid we expected a stress free party. Unfortunately, the two &quot;helpers&quot; that were there were not well trained. They were polite but did not know where to place food or how to host. Most of the food and drinks stayed downstairs even though most of the parents were upstairs. They kept asking me what to do even though i was busy trying to keep up with the birthday toddler while trying to speak with some of the guests at least. This included very common sense things like should we serve cake before or after pizza. They  spent most of their time talking to each other in the back instead of ensuring the party was running smoothly. The birthday girl did not have a central seat at the table and ended up with trash in the back ground of her photos. And the list goes on. So while the space is cool,hosting a party there is stressful as you provide all the food and do the hosting and only get very basic decorations (no themes) plus plates/cups with little help and no guidance. They even charge for ice despite the hundreds you&apos;ll spend. Hopefully they&apos;ll come up with better packages and trained staff in the future.",

Jamie and Bubba, the two main instructors, not only ensured my class and I completed the program with the necessary skills to be a competent EMT, but they personally mentored and instilled confidence in each and every single one of us. Before I knew it, I began to see my instructors and classmates as my second family as well.\\n\\nThe curriculum follows the NREMT guidelines and is broken into in-class lectures, online assignments, and psychomotor skill practical days (once a month on Sundays). The course is definitely challenging and will require work on your part. If you do not put the necessary time and energy into practicing and studying, it will show through. However, the support Jamie and Bubba provides will ensure you do not risk falling behind. \\n\\nWhat I believe sets Drexel&apos;s EMT program apart from all others is simply the passion and dedication Jamie and Bubba possess for educating the next generation of emergency medical providers. They take immense pride in teaching their students and watching them succeed in becoming certified EMT-B. They are truly two of the most, if the not the most, committed educators I have had the pleasure to learn from. It was an honor and pleasure to have learned from them.\\n\\nIf anyone has any questions on the program or wish to learn more, I would be more than happy to speak with you and provide more in-depth details of my time there.\\n\\nP.S. I received my EMT-B certification within less than a month of completing the course.",

I left not only with the skills needed to obtain my certification, but with the support of a fantastic group of EMS professionals who became like a second family to me over the duration of the course.\\n\\nThe course follows the NREMT training guidelines and was kept stringently up-to-date with new protocols, so rest assured that you will leave with the skills to handle any emergency situation you may find yourself in. The training is split between in-person lectures and online skill reviews, with a couple of in-depth skill drilling days as the exam (!!) draws nearer.\\n\\nThat said, this is the basic format that I would expect from any high-quality EMT-B course. What makes the Drexel program stand head and shoulders above the rest is the people who teach it. My course was taught by Jamie Teufel, who to this day remains one of my favorite instructors I have ever had, in any discipline. His genuine passion for EMS combined with his unwavering dedication to the success of his students made the class not just a requirement, but an absolute pleasure to take. Personally invested in each member of the class, he guided us through the convoluted process (get it together, NREMT and PADOH -- you&apos;re killing a small forest with the number of forms we have to fill out) with a seemingly endless supply of patience and knowledge.\\n\\nI could not more highly recommend that anyone interested in becoming a certified EMT take their course through the Drexel University College of Medicine -- as long as Jamie is there, and you&apos;re willing to do the legwork, I guarantee it will be one of the best experiences of your life. If you have any questions about my experience taking the course, please don&apos;t hesitate to reach out -- I would love to expand on many of the details I couldn&apos;t include here in the name of brevity.",

            "description": "The EMT-B program at Drexel is second to none. I came in with uncertainty in my ability and left with so much knowledge and confidence in my ability to treat patients. \\n\\nJamie Teufel, the course director and one of the instructors, is extremely passionate about teaching. Although I had never planned in practicing as an EMT because I was planning to pursue an M.D., I learned so much that has actually benefited me now that I am in medical school.\\n\\nSome background, I am the quintessential socially awkward nerd who is afraid to touch a patient but can tell you a lot about Biochemical pathways. As a result, I was quite terrified about not being good enough in terms of communication and being a physician who is more than a nerd. If you work in the medical field, you know that effective communication, with patients and fellow health-care providers, is imperative to good care. But rest assured, I was not to be left hanging. \\n\\nJamie and Bubba, our main instructors, made sure that all of us not only learned how to be basic EMTs but how to be competent providers. While there is a lot of work to be done, it is designed to give us the most for our time and accelerate us to be our best. The curriculum consists of both lectures and labs that are designed to teach us the roles of an EMT and the physical and communication skills that are expected of us. There are a variety of labs from a pig lab (in which we explore the lung and heart anatomy of a pig) to a Mass Casualty Incident (MCI) day in which we utilize all our skills in a simulated environment. While time consuming, these labs and labs in which we practice our skills are designed to train us in becoming proficient providers.\\n\\nIn addition to a well-designed and implemented curriculum, Jamie and Bubba are ALWAYS there to address your concerns. Because there are numerous labs, some may have time conflicts, but Jamie is always willing to work with you to ensure that you get the best education that you can. They are highly flexible because their goal is to create the best EMTs/health-care providers, and for good reason- we represent the institution when we practice. There is NO room for sub-par work!\\n\\nI highly recommend this program for anyone interested in becoming an EMT and anyone who is interested in becoming a health-care provider in general. These skills that are taught are the FOUNDATIONS to becoming competent health-care provider and can easily distinguish the &quot;good&quot; providers from the excellent.\\n\\nTLDR: Excellent program with phenomenal instructors who have high standards for their students. There&apos;s a lot of work but you&apos;ll learn a lot and become a better health-care provider because of it. On the fence? Try it out, you won&apos;t regret it.",

Also, this past year the new head of the mental health center killed himself after working here just 8 months I believe. He had come from Cornell, a notoriously depressing place. Penn is a dangerous cruel environment that you should avoid if you care about your sanity or education at all. \\nI tried to contact my advisor when I started here. She didn&apos;t respond for over six months. I finally went to the general student adviser, but sadly she quit. The advisors I had, and there were multiple, were selfish, unhelpful, and generally failing their advisees. Penn does little to help the student or guide them. I had to jump through a large number of hoops for the graduate nursing program and Penn did nothing to make this easier for the students. There was no advisor guidance, paper instructions, nothing to help make it easier. \\nWe were required to provide health records, but Penn didn&apos;t accept mine for some reason even though my prior employer (a hospital) accepted and provided them. They wanted to re-vaccinate me for literally everything. \\nGetting licensed in NJ and DE is not easy and Penn doesn&apos;t help you. \\nThey don&apos;t bring in someone to do flu shots for the nursing student or give step by step instructions on where to go to fulfill the licensing procedures. I found that the advisor really only cares about doing his or her own research, teaching is a distant second, and helping students comes last if at all. \\nWhen I started there they said they wanted us to succeed and they would do everything they could to help us do that. That&apos;s a blatant lie. If you send an e-mail with multiple questions, I know from experience you will either get a response to only one of your questions or get turfed off to someone else to answer you.  If you need extra help in a class and ask the professor where to find someone to tutor you, they either don&apos;t know or send you to someone who is tutoring 15 other people at the same time and only shows up about 3 out of 8 sessions because he or she is busy too. \\nYelp is saying my review is too long, so I&apos;ll do another review as part two.",

            "description": "I had a very dreary forecast of UPenn coming in, but after spending just one minute on campus, I realized I was dearly mistaken. Academics aside, the campus is just gorgeous. Red bricks form the walkways, which are heavily shaded by rows of towering trees. The buildings are historic, but not old or run-down enough to the point of archaism. \\n\\nI attended an info session and campus tour, which were both fine in their own right (I got a bunch of free &quot;fancy brochures&quot;, which I&apos;m definitely not complaining about), but the campus itself made the biggest impression. The off-campus atmosphere was mediocre at best, but the on-campus environment proved itself to be homely and relaxing and just a wonderful place to spend an afternoon (or four years) at. Stop on by, I recommend it.",

While I was there, I had a chance to take classes from business and engineering to urban studies and foreign languages (I even got to take American Sign Language class, too!).\\n\\nMy friends all are successful in the paths and passions they choose to pursue.

            "description": "I&apos;m tempted to write about Penn from an academic and student culture perspective, since everyone here has plenty opinions about that. But since this is Yelp, I&apos;m going to direct my attentions to people who are going to visit this place for the beauty of the campus, or who are thinking of living nearby, and not to try to impose my opinion on prospective students (who should be asking current students 1:1 for college-picking advice anyway). \\n\\nPenn&apos;s campus&apos;s big cohesive force is Locust Walk, which connects the high rise residences (where a lot of students end up living, either in the high-rises or on cheap off-campus housing) all the way to the buildings on the far sides of campus. This brick boulevard is lined with trees and keeps the campus from feeling like just another part of the city. Walking down Locust sort of feels like walking through an actual park, especially at night when the hordes of students have trickled down to just you and your footsteps. \\n\\nPenn&apos;s buildings are quite grand and beautiful, especially Fisher Fine Arts Library, which is so nice that drawing classes tend to come here to sketch its innards. The New College House, on the other hand, is very contemporary and decked out with cool tech for its residents. Finally, the high-rises offer views that you don&apos;t get tired of for your entire undergrad career, and only suck in the winter when they form wind tunnels of hell that blow you backwards while you struggle towards your dorm. \\n\\nFoodwise, the campus is ringed with tons of restaurants, but the best food is across the bridge near Rittenhouse Square. Same with groceries -- there are some expensive, meh-quality places to get ingredients on campus, but Trader Joe&apos;s has by far the fresher produce and fairer prices. \\n\\nTime sort of passes instantaneously while walking around campus after you get used to it, and I&apos;ve learned to cut through certain buildings to shave off five minutes or so from my commute at a time. As a student the campus feels smaller and smaller every year, but the streets named after tree varieties never quite become engrained into memory, and in freshman year I remember getting lost between 38th and 39th.",

            "description": "I really enjoyed living and going to classes (when I could wake up for them) here.\\n\\nWhile there are the downsides (inevitably, cockroaches, dirty roommates in  the dorms, crazy people begging, and what a cost ... my wallet still hurts), there were plenty of plusses.\\n\\nFor the people who complain about Penn contributing nothing... consider that it&apos;s one of the largest employers in the region, contributing to countless people&apos;s income in that regard. The students and staff use millions of dollars worth of local supplies and spend plenty of money in the city proper, not just on-campus. While students are encouraged to be careful of the surroundings, it&apos;s no where near as dangerous to students as more than a dozen years ago.\\n\\nWhile some of the buildings were old and scary (ever check out the basement in DRL?), others are brand-spanking new and spit-polished shiny (Huntsman, anyone?), and the University does try hard to make everything close enough for students to access for those who either don&apos;t wish to go downtown or don&apos;t know better to go downtown.  The food carts were a blessing at almost all hours, the cafeteria food wasn&apos;t really that bad (although the service was inconsistent), and Wawa was always open to serve up a sandwich for you. Over the years, more bike lanes appeared and more cops patrol the area, and a facelift was given to Houston Hall / Perelman Quad, the Quad itself got air conditioning, and the high rises were given new names (although I&apos;ll still refer to them all as High Rise East, North, and South), and new windows &amp; paint.\\n\\n1920 Commons still can&apos;t match Hill for food, but they added many fast food options on-campus from a Taco Bell to Subway. While I miss my Burger King, the food carts, again, help to make up for it.  Fresh Grocer now adds value as a large grocery store for the students at a decent price, and the Bridge provides entertainment as a movie theater.\\n\\nNew Deck, Smokes, Allegros and more are food options, and bubble tea has even grown from when my friends decided to do it as a project during their college years. And Locust Walk has even undergone renovation... they moved Ben Franklin to in front of Steiny-D for now as they repair his old spot by the compass.\\n\\nA big university hospital helped to diagnose issues with friends, and treats countless community members for injuries both great and small.  Research is heavily invested in, and the libraries are second to none.\\n\\nThere are bad professors and good, but that&apos;s like any other institution. I can&apos;t name a single school which has outstanding researchers &amp; outstanding teachers in every single class, nor will there ever be with the plethora of people that come through here. \\n\\nNeed-based aid is now all grants, no loans, so that&apos;s amazing in and of itself. A huge amount spent on Hey Day, Spring Fling, Homecoming, and more for alumni and students.  Cheap dental work at the Dental School. New expensive housing for people who want to live close to the school, but still the old dorm grad housing for those who don&apos;t want to do that.  Museums (the ICA and University Art/Archeology), and displays, plenty of speakers coming through the Kelly Writer&apos;s House and Irvine, or small preceptorials that introduced us to wines, dinosaurs, or cuisine in Philadelphia. A restaurant school just minutes walk away.\\n\\nAnyone remember Walnut Walk? Or Feb Club? Dances &amp; parties, frat houses and off-campus housing.\\n\\nI miss having everything so close. University City it may have been complete enough for the students to isolate them from the city, but it provided a very stable base to go wandering out to the rest of the city.",

            "description": "CLASSES- UNDERGRAD/GRAD (4 out of 5)\\n\\nI went here for undergrad in ChE and took a grad course in MSE.  Overall, classes here are pretty good.  Class sizes can be crazy huge for your standard chem, phys, econ, etc.  Competition is also pretty high so it can be daunting.  Profs here ranged from accessible to inaccessible.  At the time, Penn Course Guide was good to rate profs so you know what you are getting yourself into.  Now, I&apos;m sure there are online reviews for classes.\\n\\nLIBRARY- GENERAL COLLECTION, ILL, EZ-BORROW, PRINTING (5 out of 5)\\n\\nI can&apos;t complain except for the price for borrower&apos;s access as alumni.  As a student, it&apos;s great but sucks to be an outsider like alumni.  Catalog is pretty huge here and if you can&apos;t get it here, librarians can get it for you.  Printing basically sucks now.  Before, I remembered as an undergrad printing everywhere was free with your tuition/fees.  Now, it&apos;s nickel and dime you by charging your Penn card like a copy card.  \\n\\nGYM- REC CENTER, SWIMMING POOL, CLASSES (4 out of 5)\\n\\nWow, this place is HUGE.  Pottruck is much larger than I remembered when I was an undergrad.  However, the fees will bite you in the butt since it&apos;s optional for grad students.  The outdoors rec center is pretty decent with outdoors climbing clinics.  I found it to be pretty reasonably price and good experience.  Pool is really nice here as well.  Tons of cardio equipment here as well as class rooms for yoga/zumba/etc.\\n\\nBURSAR&apos;S OFFICE/BOOKSTORE (2 out of 5)\\n\\nA bit of a nightmare for registration.  Alot of red tape from dept to Eng school to Registrar&apos;s Office.  It helps to have patience when registering a course outside your dept.  Overall, not the most pleasant experience and tuition here is pretty steep.  I soon realized after getting the bill- at least my company paid for it.  I had to study like hell for the course to do decent in the class- still it was a tough grad course.\\n\\nCAREER SERVICES (5 out of 5)\\n\\nI used career services in the past as an undergrad for on-campus interviews from neighboring companies.  However, I think I have benefited more now with their counselors and mock interviews.  The staff here is great and very accommodating.  There are counselors for each school- Eng, College, Dental, etc.  So, they specialize in all areas which I haven&apos;t found from other schools.  Easy to get help over the phone or onsite and help out alumni as well.  I can&apos;t say enough that this place is just a huge asset when it comes to career search/development.\\n\\nVERDICT (4 out of 5)\\n\\nI can&apos;t say that I loved being a student here.  It&apos;s stressful even taking a grad course.  However, education wise it is probably the most challenging in my mind.  I had some really great profs who saw my perserverance and kept me afloat when I felt it was unending battle ahead.",

Basically, if you want to do it, you most likely can at Penn. \\nThe faculty that I have interacted with have been amazing.\\nstudents in my cohort have done so many amazing things prior to grad school, which makes classes interesting and engaging. \\nThe libraries are beautiful. Students usually use the words Fisher and Hogwarts in the same sentence. I have found Fisher to be very quiet and a great place to study. Van Pelt has so many great spots to write papers and read at. Van Pelt also has a quiet graduate student area that you can swipe your Penn card to get into, as well as a new reading room (located just as you walk into the library - to the right), and beautiful views of the city.\\nThe graduate student community here is also a definite plus! There are a lot of events offered to meet other graduate students.

This cohort dominates the social scene. \\n\\n-It&apos;s too big and impersonal for anyone to really care about the lives of its undergrads. Penn is churning out industrial sized tanks of Bud Lite, not craft brewing quality in small batches.

            "description": "My niece plays basketball for this University. I actually spent a lot of time here when I was in HS while my mom was working on her 4th degree from Rutgers. She didn&apos;t want to come alone at night so I would accompany her to her classes. \\n\\nMy cousin went here from 99-2001 and many other family members. So I suppose we have a long standing relationship with this school and it is a great University with two campuses or more in NJ. I can&apos;t speak for thier athletics department because Rutgers football program gets beat by everyone and I&apos;ve only gone to one female basketball game. But the education is one of the best in the state. \\n\\nThis campus sits on the waterfront in Camden NJ, one of the roughest parts of south jersey, but they do an excellent job of keeping the campus clean and safe for students. I&apos;ve never known any of my 7 family members that graduated from Rutgers to ever have issues.",

            "description": "I have just moved onto the Rutgers Camden campus for graduate school.  So far I am very impressed with the organization that they have with Rutgers new Brunswick.   I had gone to Newark Rutgers and they had no collaboration with the other rutger&apos;s so when I needed something it was annoying.  Here it is not the case they work well with the other rutger&apos;s and it makes things a breeze.  I am living in the graduate dorms at 330 cooper and I have to say they are gorgeous they are four bedroom suites and 4 separate bedrooms with a large living area and two bathrooms to share.  I have not been to any classes yet but have met with a lot of my teachers and they all seem very professional down to earth but professional which is what you want from a professor.  I am very glad they accepted me to come here because I have only been here a day and am amazed at this place.  They make you feel like you are at home with the massive campus all the amenities and security like you wouldn&apos;t belive.  If you are looking to finish your degree or try and get another I would recommend this campus.  This is a subjective view as I go here.",

This is one of the best academic campuses in the state, and you will learn more here and have access to so many opportunities in the Metro Philly, NYC, and DC areas because of the partnerships and faculty involved. Going here was a great decision, but I wish the university would make some capital improvements to the physical buildings to keep up with other universities. \\n\\nRutgers-Camden will forever shine on the banks of the old Delaware!",

Rutgers police is everywhere and unless you are completely careless you will be safe. for example, I wouldn&apos;t walk back to the parking lot at night, but rather take the Rutgers bus. \\nsome buildings are better than others. do not expect Princeton-U feel when you walk down the halls. generally the place is fairly neat and clean. \\nthe administration is on and off: accounting people are helpful and pleasant; general administrative offices are... not so much. \\nnow, for the quality of education. there are some incredibly talented professors that will make you love your college experience. some adjunct  instructors are okay at best, but generally I am very satisfied with the quality. \\nthe career services folks are knowledgeable and helpful. \\nthe cafeteria is actually very good and  reasonably prices. \\nthe library is a little bit of a mess, but that is only because it&apos;s been under construction for the past couple of  years.\\nthere is life on campus, thanks to different events and trips, etc... \\ngenerally, it is a good bang for your buck.",

I also was accepted years ago at the Dickinson School of Law, which is un-related to DC but sits at the edge of its campus. As such, I&apos;ve been to Carlisle a number of times over the past 30 years, both as a prospective law student and as the parent of a DC student. Here&apos;s my &quot;review&quot; of Dickinson College and the surrounding town/area...\\n\\nBeautiful campus, strong alumni network, including extremely successful alums like the CEO/President of LL Bean. Numerous awards for being a top-rated college as to sustainability. Responsive staff. Small student to teacher ratio. Encourages students to find their passion, so interesting combinations of double majors and majors/minor abound, and students don&apos;t declare their major until Jr year, I believe.\\n\\nEncourages study abroad and for a somewhat unique statistic I think, Dickinson states that 60% of its student athletes do so, with the coaches&apos; encouragement! \\n\\nDickinson is what it appears to be, &quot;family&quot; to its alumns and students. Extremely supportive all-around. \\n\\nLocation is close to Harrisburg, the Commonwealth&apos;s capital, as well as an easy 1.75 hour ride to Phila area (85 miles in my case!) as a straight shot down the PA  Turnpike!\\n\\nOne comment stated this is a boring school with nothing to do. That&apos;s ridiculous. There are attractions within an easy drive, _lots_of activities on campus, and a growing diversity of students. And, to callously call the surrounding area as being full of &quot;red-necks&quot; is nonsense. As a former diversity trainer with a major Fortune50 company and within the USCG Aux, that statement really jolted me.\\n\\nThe folks in Carlisle may be more rural in background than say someone from a city or a suburb near a city, but they are welcoming and friendly. Judging an entire community based on some interaction had with one or two (perhaps) is simply unfair to the community as a whole).\\n\\nGo Red Devils!\\n\\nPS To YELP: Why the heck would you NOT recommend the 3 &quot;Not Recommended&quot; 5-star reviews that were well-written, thoughtful and gave details upon which the reviews were based? And, from both students and parents! I don&apos;t get it! If they were included, DC would have a near 5-Star rating which is more in-line with what I&apos;ve experienced via the many alumns I&apos;ve met, both at DC functions AND by pure chance in the &quot;big outside world&quot; where they had no reason to be biased in their view...i.e. I met them via normal, everyday encounters via my job, etc!",

Therefore, my wife and I drove from another state to take a tour and were told by our daycare to do it unannounced to get a true feeling on how they interact with the kids and with you. We entered to building... Yes we entered the building and walked around for 15 minutes looking (without a code) and did not run into a singleness member. This should have been our first warning to run but I gave them the benefit and tracked down a worker due to no staff being in their offices either. The staff member said they were celebrating a event and said tonsit and wait and the director would come out and speak with us. So we waited for 15 minutes and subsequently I went and tracked down another staff member and asked if the director had time for us today. Finally the director came out of a room and seemed irritated to even speak with us. She said no tours could be given today. I asked if we could come back later in day to do a tour and her response was no I have to pick my kids up at 3. I then asked her if anyone else was available to give a tour and her response was no. After this attempt my wife and I left. Please don&apos;t bring your kids to this daycare due to safety concerns with anybody being able to walk in /out unannounced and the unpleasant staff that could possibly take care of your kids.",

There wasnt any  prior intimation, nor were parents concerns invited. I mean how can you demote a child to a lower school program, there is definitely some big difference between the two levels.   I observed that the children in early preschool were mostly exposed to television and showed stuff like Curious George ... \\n\\nThough we have relocated and thankfully out of the class otherwise i would have to wait for my child to go to Junior again only if there was any vacancy again.  So weird !!!\\n\\nThe teachers, esp Ms Becky, junior preschool was great... however the school management is not very friendly.",

I will speak for the infant/toddler rooms only for this is where my child was at during his enrollment. There is high turnover with the teachers, inconsistent structure, sporadic or sometimes no updates on child throughout the day on the &quot;daily connect app&quot;, dirty rooms, children sharing their belongings, etc. I had a Tylenol bottle come up empty after just buying it! Was this given to my child? Other children? Nobody seemed to know anything about it. My child came home with a huge scratch on his arm and there is still a scar from it. Again, none of the teachers knew what happened.

THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A PHILOSOPHY.\\n\\nA review of any college is perhaps more a ridiculous proposition than reviewing other things because, in addition to the usual vagaries of opinion, a college of any size will not be experienced by two people in remotely the same way. Are you a student (whether traditional or not; whether serious or not -- I&apos;ll not say, whether intelligent or not), an office worker, administrator, instructor, or someone attached to the college in some cooperative capacity, or a combination of any of these? NWACC is large enough to encompass a plethora of experiences. So, a review that begins, &quot;My algebra teacher was a bore,&quot; wouldn&apos;t begin to characterize the potential of any community college.\\n\\nAs for me (who functions as an employee, one that has worked at other community colleges and universities), I enjoy the campus, which is nicer than many other campi (noun, Latin plural). That is important; I like clean lines. The library, which is always the clincher, will more than adequately support most any academic endeavor, for both student and professional, with friendly assistance. As for the education, accessibility is stressed, I have clearly seen, which is good news for many. And, out of the classroom, college culture is promoted in a variety of ways, for those who require that.\\n\\nWhat else can be said? Yeah, that one guy cut me off in the parking lot. Rotten teen drivers! And, they don&apos;t offer the Vietnamese courses I would like to take ... maybe even throw in a field trip to Saigon. Oh, well. Still, I&apos;m a fan.",

The instructors and advisors are very friendly and knowledgeable, and the scheduling can be done around some schedules along with the ability to take online courses.

First off, yes I will agree with Rachel J&apos;s review below about the previous asst director, however since we started she left about a month after and things couldn&apos;t be any better!  I get updates on my little girl throughout the day and pictures as well!  I love all the art projects they do with the little ones and book reading, exploring, playing outdoors, etc.... No matter how young, they have a curriculum planned daily for your little one.  I don&apos;t feel like I could even come close to matching all the fun things they do here with my little one.  It seems like she comes home weekly learning and saying something new.  I just love it!  And the teachers and staff here are OUTSTANDING!  You can tell they genuinely care for your child and not sure how, but everyone knows her by name, office staff and other teachers she&apos;s never had.  \\n\\nI will add, no one paid me to write this, just an honest review because I know how hard it is to find GREAT childcare.  I think I toured over half of them in the area and if it&apos;s not the BEST then it&apos;s not for my little one.  Thanks Cadence staff for being so great!!",

From the moment we walked in, we felt the warmth, care, and professionalism that encompass the entire center. Annalyn, the director has done a wonderful job getting to know all the students and families and making us all feel welcome and part of the Cadence family. Any questions or concerns I&apos;ve had have been immediately answered or addressed. \\nAll of the teachers have great attitudes and genuinely care about their students. They provide plenty of one on one time throughout the day, and even extra TLC when needed. Miss Abbie, the lead infant teacher does a fantastic job and is passionate about her babies. She has worked with my twins through several transitions already and continues to teach them new skills everyday. We would love for her to move to toddlers with them!\\n\\nOverall, Cadence Academy is a top notch school in Rogers and comes highly recommended. I don&apos;t know how anyone could have anything negative to say about this school and the staff!",

            "description": "I decided to join this school because I wanted to learn my job and get right into the field without having to deal with the extra stuff at an actual college. Unfortunately, this place was WAY more hassle than just taking some extra nonsense courses. Let&apos;s list the problems:\\n\\n1: They force you to take a &quot;College Math&quot; course. To begin, this is not a college math course. This course is a 9th grade course which involves very basic algebra, conversions, and geometry. The school gives you no chance to test out of this class unless you continually berate them and express your anger that you&apos;re being forced to pay $1,000 or more for a course you absolutely do not need. I was even told &quot;Yes, you&apos;ll have to pay that money, but at least you&apos;ll get an A.&quot; Had to have three discussions with them before they allowed me to pay $100 to test out, which I aced with no sort of studying prior.\\n\\n2: A majority of their staff is out to get you and are about as useful as teachers as a rock is. They had a computer teacher that knew nothing about computers and may have been on drugs. This teacher was kept for A MONTH before they finally bothered to listen to the complaints from the students and gave her the boot. Their one law teacher forces you to be your own teacher and does whatever she can to make students fail. You could be dying in the hospital, finally recover, and she would refuse to let you make up any work because it was your responsibility to keep up on it. Even if you were dying. And she refused to tell you about any of the work since she didn&apos;t plan any or her classes and just decided to wing it every time. But that&apos;s your fault for almost dying, so you deserve to fail the course.\\n\\n3: They have zero respect for the military or their students. I gave my teachers almost a two month notice that I would be leaving to go to Texas for a basic training graduation. Only one teacher, who was responsible enough to plan his classes, was able to give me the work I needed to get done and allowed me to get it completed before I left. The other teacher, mentioned in my last point, in fact, didn&apos;t give me any work until the day before I left. Then she had the audacity to have a MASSIVE two-part, 130 point assignment on the last day I told her I would be gone. She refused to let me make that up, of course. Then after getting incredibly irate at her, she kicked me out and THREATENED A POP QUIZ, which cannot ever be made up, and she actually went through with the threat. I went to the two highest ranking people at the school, who both belittled me and refused to acknowledge that the teacher did any wrong. Even after I admitted to doing wrong on my part and accepting my punishment for what I said to the teacher, the completely stood by the teacher. One even made reference to me going to a BASIC TRAINING GRADUATION, something that happens once in a lifetime, as &quot;Well you were the one that chose to go on a vacation.&quot;\\n\\n4: They have a dress code, but do not stick to it, nor do they care about enforcing it. When I first started going there, they were business casual only. Now you can walk around in short and flip flops with your breasts almost hanging out, and nobody bats an eye.\\n\\n5: Gum under all of the desks with little care from staff when this was brought to their attention.\\n\\n6: Their computer classes are worthless and a waste of money. Especially the ones where they are teaching you to type when a majority of students already know how to type well. They allow no test outs for this, therefor you end up wasting THOUSANDS of dollars, again.\\n\\n7: Most teachers accept sub-par work, so if you want to put half effort into something and get an A, this place is for you. Only the English teacher, who I greatly respect, expects you to improve and to do great work. She&apos;s also the only one who really teaches you what you need to know, and teaches it well.\\n\\n8: They tried to deny multiple law students their degrees because they insisted that their externships were not good enough, even though the lead of their program approved it.\\n\\n9: They have multiple security violations at the school, such as a multitude of light bulbs being out. When brought to their attention by the students, they responded &quot;It&apos;s not in the budget.&quot;\\n\\n10: They overcharge for the sub-par education they are giving you.\\n\\nIf you truly care about your future and care about learning, then this place is NOT for you. If you want to get a degree with minimal effort, minimal gained knowledge, and a massive hole in your pocket, then this place will be wonderful for you.",

The instructors here do not care about teaching; they do not care if you learn; and they sure don&apos;t give a d**m if you succeed and graduate. They care about the money -- and that is it. McCann purchased my school in the middle of my education and since then -- problem after problem. I began when it was CTC in Monroe, LA and half way through they changed to McCann. They changed the classes to 5 weeks long with four hour classes - and then load you up on classes and hope you fail so they can charge you for the class again. My admissions representative lied to me (typical) when I enrolled. She told me it was an Associates of Sciences Degree -- and that any college would take my credits. I called over 100 colleges in the country and found a handful that would. I haven&apos;t learned anything in any of my classes. Please, do your research BEFORE you enroll in a school. I am transferring to Southern New Hampshire University where they actually care about your education; they are a non-profit; and the Degree is an ACTUAL DEGREE. An Associate Degree in Occupational Studies? I shall pass.",

Nodin has been with this location for about 4 months now. He&apos;s 2 1/2 and an only child. We moved here from Denver in August and it hasn&apos;t been the easiest transition for him. Enrolling him at La petite Bentonville Ar. has been the one of the best choices as parents we&apos;ve made. We recently started potty training and genuinely had no idea how much work time and stress can accompany that life change. Our son who has always slept through the night started getting up multiple times each night as he curiously wanting to grasp this new toilet concept. I more often than not drop him off at La Petite Academy after having had almost no sleep  and every morning Whitney and I go over his progress and she gives suggestions and tips I would not know otherwise. She is completely dedicated to every child in the building and having someone to answer my questions, tactically make me aware of potential mistakes, while still making me feel validated as a mother has truly been a blessing. I trust her and the staff completely while my son is i their care  and to me that&apos;s priceless.",

This is her first daycare and at first she had a really hard time at drop off, but they are really good with her and it&apos;s getting better and better every day. She has SO much fun when she gets there and they send updates and pictures throughout the day. Everyone knows her name and she is well loved. The director is outstanding. Whitney knows each child by name and obviously loves them and her job. Her educational background ensures that they are learning age appropriate skills and having fun doing it. I couldn&apos;t have asked for a better place to put my precious daughter.",

They allow the ABA therapists from Thrive and the OT and SLT therapy teams to work at the school.  The director and teachers really work together with the therapists to help our son get ready for kindergarten.  Joe was not speaking many words when he started, and his language has increased and his skills have improved where he can attend a general education classroom next year.  La Petite is truly a safe, fun, educational, and perfect place for our son to learn and make friends. I don&apos;t know where we would be without them, and they have changed our lives for the better in our family.  Thank you so much!",

My pre-school grandson came to visit during a week when I had to work and I decided it was time for him to try a daycare setting to prepare for Kindergarten.  I met with La Petite Director Misty Hopkins and after an excellent discussion little Ivan was ready to start the next business day.  After his week he said he made LOTS of friends.  Overall he had a really wonderful experience and now he&apos;s better prepared to start school next month.  Thanks Misty and all the ladies at La Petite!",

More importantly, very few who are as tolerant, inclusive, and focused on raising children to honor peace and civility and to appreciate the natural world around them.\\n\\nMontessori is not daycare. It is not even your traditional school. Children at Walnut Farm are empowered to do things for themselves, and to study that which interests them most. In addition to several well appointed Montessori classrooms they also have a few unique features such as an outdoor classroom where children are learning life skills including gardening and caring for animals. The school also has a natural playground with features literally carved from the forested hillside.\\n\\nI see my little boy growing into a confident, warm, caring, and intelligent young man at Walnut Farm. He loves to read and do math. He is fascinated by and in love with every kind of animal. He loves his teachers and his classmates. \\n\\nWhen kids reach school age, we rely on the school to mold them into the people we want them to be. Schools have the kids from 8 to 3 most days, leaving just 4 or 5 hours with their parents. If they are going to play that big a role in the development of my child... then I feel strongly about choosing a school that not only does a good job educating my child, but also teaches him to grow up tolerant of the many differences in people around the world. \\n\\nThey take children from toddlers through around the equivalent of 6th grade.",

We absolutely love the school and it&apos;s staff. The teachers are truly special and amazing! They are witty, kind, knowledgable,compassionate, creative, and have such a wealth of experience. We have a lot of experience with having been through 6 preschools between both of my kids. We love the involvement with nature and the lack of electronics in the school. My daughter learned to read in the past year, and her confidence is amazing. She has also learned great conflict resolution skills (communication) and real life skills (ex: setting/clearing the table). This school has a great peaceful &amp; positive enviornment  that is very welcoming. I am so grateful that they are here!",

We wanted a place where his natural curiosity can be fostered. We wanted a place where tolerance, acceptance, and peace are just a natural part of the day. \\n\\nNot only is he receiving core curriculum (reading, writing, math, science), but he is exposed to rich extras such as Spanish, nature education, life skills, art, and music. Children learn to investigate and research from a very young age. The learning is sparked by interest - so the child is more invested in it. \\n\\nThe Montessori method truly is remarkable and Walnut Farm does a lovely job of presenting an authentic experience. The classrooms - both indoor and outdoor - are led by caring, passionate teachers where the students are encouraged to engage with the lessons. They are empowered to learn and given the necessary tools to do so.\\n\\nIf you have a child between 18 months and 12 years and want more than just a traditional education, consider a visit to Walnut Farm. It is my greatest hope that you see what my family saw the very first time we set foot on the campus.",

It really gives the children freedom to explore what interests them and therefore stretches their attention and learning.  They have an outdoor classroom with a teacher outside at all times for instruction.  I think that is amazing!  There are two trained teachers in each room.

No additional fees like some other places. We spent several hours there finishing our items. The staff was friendly and very kind and patient with my seven year old who lost interest in finishing her project after the second coat. The other customers were also very kind. While we were there, they hosted two parties and several other guests but we still had all the supplies we needed and staff to help when needed. We are excited to return and pick up our items and to revisit with my other children. We will definitely go back!  \\nThey recently moved to this location in High st from the Plaza Mall.

We were all a bit overly ambitious in picking out ceramics to paint (we were first-timers and didn&apos;t know what we were doing). As such, we ended up needing to come in for a total of over 7 hours over the course of a few days to finish our projects. Karen, the owner, was so very patient with us and incredibly kind. She made sure that we had all the tools and paints we needed to make our projects. She had exactly the right balance of being available to answer questions and give us additional information without seeming in the way or overbearing. She even offered to let us borrow some paints to take home to work on our pieces outside of the studio&apos;s open hours. That kind of generosity and customer service is a true gift.\\n\\nBeyond that, the ambiance of the place is perfect for unleashing an inner artist. As a very old building, the original features of the home have been marked and dated, making it fun to wonder about what the 1860&apos;s original wall-paper must have seen in its time!\\n\\nThe prices for the pieces are incredibly reasonable, and without additional sitting fees or firing fees, the fun-per-dollar ratio is a fantastic one. We also found a fantastic deal on Living Social, making the experience even more of bargain.\\n\\nIn sum, I would highly recommend Create-A-Palooza to individuals, couples, families, and anyone else who has an interest in being creative!",

First I was FREEZING I asked the &quot; instructor&quot; can I please go outside I&apos;m cold while my hair was proccing. She bit my head off, I asked for another cape sweater something. When the product starting burning I had enough and asked to just rinse it out.  She rolled her eyes ( which had way to much and to dark of shadow on them)  she bit my head off, to which I replied you are a very rude person to which she responded YOU ARE RUDE! JUST floored I could not get out of there fast enough. When I went to pay which I know I know I should not have.. 80 for them to screw my hair up. When I got home she had tacked on an additional 17 I&apos;m assuming a tip??? Which was not deserved and is highly illegal. I did take a picture.. If u value your hair DONT go here.",

When I couldn&apos;t get in touch with my regular stylist, I decided to give this girl a try. I have two-toned hair, blonde on top, red on bottom. I wanted a highlight and trim. Long story short...the little girl MELTED MY HAIR!! I understand that can happen and I tried not to panic. She had to cut off ALOT of hair to try her best to get rid of the melted hair. Did a deep conditioner...my hair still looks a bit like a cotton ball. That&apos;s not the worst part...the woman instructor along with one of the owner&apos;s sons came over and told me that they would waive the fee for the deep conditioner so I&apos;d only owe $41!!  I told her I wasn&apos;t paying to have my hair melted to which they responded &quot;that&apos;s theft of services&quot; and threatened to call the police on me. The owner&apos;s son proceeded to insult me saying my hair was fried before I came in. Let me mention that I get at least 2-3 compliments a day on my hair...it was a little dry because I bleach the top, it was far from fried and I typically do the color myself. I have never ended up with melted hair. Ironically, I decided to do highlights on the top because I wanted LESS damage. I ended up calling the police myself when they told me if I left without paying they would get my license number and have me arrested. Turned out....I had to pay...I&apos;ll have to take them to small claims court if I want my money back. You can get a messed up hairdo anyplace...it happens, but the way they handled it, unapologetically and insulting is absolutely appalling. NEVER AGAIN...they&apos;re HORRIBLE!!!!!",

They are registered in New York State as a DAYCARE, not a preschool, and they&apos;ll do everything possible to hide this fact from parents. They therefore have no standards to uphold, and your kid will learn nothing - not shapes, letters, colors, etc. There is zero kindergarten preparedness happening at St. Mary&apos;s.\\n\\nThe &quot;teachers&quot; are simply babysitters, and if you think it&apos;s impossible to be &apos;bad&apos; at being a preschool instructor, you&apos;re wrong. I&apos;m certain that my kid&apos;s classroom babysitter has an intellectual disability herself, with her vacant stare and utter inability to communicate to other adults. It&apos;s just not something you want your kid to become accustomed to all week.\\n\\nThe kids just watch TV all day, although they may let them outside to use the very small jungle gym if it&apos;s warm out (e.g. basically never). Once in a great while, they will send my kid home with a craft project that they spent maybe an hour doing. The rest of the time is spent with the basic daycare routine of snacks, naps and playing with toys.\\n\\nIf that&apos;s all you&apos;re looking for, then St. Mary&apos;s is probably the same as any other daycare. If you want your child to be ready for kindergarten though, this is NOT the place to send him or her. \\n\\nSt. Mary&apos;s is not a preschool. Don&apos;t make the mistakes we did. STAY AWAY!!!",

The level of acting, lighting/effects and overall script took you deep into the heart of a spooky jungle. The cast showcased their talents and got me scared right into the Scary season! My partner and I got drinks downstairs at Brews which added to the overall wonderful date night we had! Can&apos;t wait to see their next production!",

The show is based on a story about a young married couple who unknowingly move into one of the most haunted houses in the country. The writing is truly brilliant as is the choreography, lighting and setup between sets. The way the dancing actors incorporate dance into a few scenes is also astounding. No spoilers, but this is a must see in Eureka Springs. This show will be going on until November I believe. Can&apos;t wait till we have family come to visit us here so we can take them and see it again!",

            "description": "This group and performance were like nothing we have ever seen. Raymond and Emma, founders of a dance studio that moved here from Colorado, have created seasonal performances in Eureka Springs before but this is the first time we have seen them and their acting/dancing crew. They now have a hit show and are letting local residents and vacationers alike see what they can do. And they can do much more than you can imagine!\\n\\nThe performance we attended was &apos;Anna.&apos;It is a performance that runs like a traditional three act play, presenting a young couple who just bought a large house on a huge piece of land. The house has a history, and the history slowly sinks its claws into the couple and their friends and family. I will say no more on the plot, but you are up close, inside the house from the opening scene, so prepare yourself. \\n\\nThe actors all live out these characters naturally and can bounce between eras in dress, voice and style in the flick of an eye. They are &quot;around&quot; the audience at times, making you feel more and more as if you&apos;re inside the house. They use light, and sound, and excellent special effects timing, to make you squirm as you begin to realize what&apos;s happening.  While it is not a musical, music figures strongly in, as does their expert dancing. This makes &apos;Anna&apos; like no other live stage performance we have seen, and we were blown away. The dancing feels natural because it is integral to the story and the transporting of the audience across time and into the heads of the characters.  You will love it. Well done, Raymond, Emma, and the rest of Melonlight! We will see this again if it is still playing on our next trip. And if you have something new, we&apos;ll be sure to see that! Thank you for creating something great in this lovely town.",

They didn&apos;t treat us as good customers, they treated us more as friends, and it was very much appreciated! Quality of instruction was amazing and as someone who can not dance (and knows it very well) and therefor is extremely self conscious, they helped me get over that in a hurry. I went from embarrassed to dance in front of my wife to doing the Thriller dance with their group in front of thousands of people in less than a week. If you get a chance and have ever even remotely thought of taking a dance class, you owe it to yourself to go by and take a lesson here.",

            "description": "Wine in Arkansas? I know what you&apos;re thinking... but hear me out. This is some award winning stuff! And they use their own local grapes (winning)! The tasting is no cost, and bottles are extremely reasonable. If you buy two bottles, you get a free wine glass. Wine is $6 by the glass.\\n\\nA big fan of wineries in Europe and South America (Italy, France, Chile, Spain, etc.), and my beloved Sonoma, you aren&apos;t going to get the same type of experience or aesthetic here. And at the time I went in, COVID was (is) still a concern, so the tasting was different than you&apos;d usually get - and disposable cups were used instead of glasses which would definitely allow for a better taste of the wine.\\n\\nNow, I am an equal opportunity wine drinker. I tend to gravitate more toward the reds, but it was the whites that were the show-stoppers for me here! \\n\\nOverall, with the reds, I found them to all taste more like &quot;light&quot; ports. I did take a bottle of the Cab Franc home, and it was alright, but I didn&apos;t love it. For the port itself, I liked the Ozark Strong a bit more than the Big C (which is a tawny). The Sweet Spring which is a Chambourcin was my favorite, good finish.\\n\\nThe star? The Vignoles which is a French hybrid from the Keels Creek Vineyard and another nearby farm (I believe the owner said it is in Hindsville, not too far away). It has some really nice Pineapple notes. It&apos;s not toooo dry, but dry enough. I love this with spicy chili or tacos. I think it would also go well with some smoked fish or chicken. I also enjoyed the Chardonel and could totally taste those green apple notes. The Melange was pretty sweet for me, but the finish I really liked.\\n\\nAll COVID regulations were followed. The owner wore a mask, kept physically distanced and any type I removed my mask to sip, he stepped back even more. Another couple came in and waited in a sitting area.\\n\\n5 stars for being low key, a great white and local!",

            "description": "My husband and I came for a tasting planning to bring home a bottle of Arkansas wine. We&apos;ve never had wine from this region before.  When we entered the shop, it was empty except for one couple at the bar. They were doing a tasting. The woman behind the counter told us she would be with us as soon as she finished with the couple. We waited thinking that she would do a pour and then help us while they tasted their selection. After about 8 minutes, it became clear that she was going to finish their ENTIRE TASTING before even inviting us to sit down. At that point, we decided to just order a glass and not do a tasting. We approached the bar again to ask about a specific wine and to place an order for wine to take to a table.  Clearly irritated, she firmly told us that she would be with us when the current couple finished their tasting, so we left. We live right in the middle of Texas wine country, and visit wineries frequently and have NEVER experienced anything like this in Texas, California, Italy, or anywhere else. Tasting room staff are typically able to work with multiple customers at the same time. If this woman is too challenged to serve more than one customer/small group at time, management should consider getting her some help or replacing her with someone who can actually serve customers and make sales. We were disappointed to not have experienced any Arkansas wine. Some of it looked very interesting. If you decide to go here, I hope your experience is better than ours.",

They offered free wine tastings and $5 glasses of wine which seemed like a great deal.  The tastings were pretty good and fairly informative but the Sommelier was extremely standoffish and not engaging at all.  She seemed very irritated by us when we were just trying to make polite conversation.  She seemed to want to hurry though it although we were the only ones there and I about 1 hour before closing.  We did end up buying a bottle of wine and probably would have purchased more if she had been a bit more welcoming and a better salesperson! The gentleman that checked us out (perhaps the owner?) was very nice, however.  We decided to get a glass of wine and enjoy it on their nice little patio after the quick tasting.  \\nI&apos;ve always enjoyed wine tastings in small wineries like this and love the conversation that usually comes along with the tastings.  Perhaps she was having a bad day?",

Will NEVER return!!!",

She couldn&apos;t wait to get rid of us. She sized us up the minute we walked in the door and was cold through the entire experience. I&apos;ve reached an age to just ignore people like that but today I was speaking to another tourist and she had a similar experience and so I decided to do this Yelp review.  The business is for sale and I think it could be very popular and a must do destination if the hospitality can be improved. And by the way, we did buy 4 bottles of wine but will NOT be going back.",

She needs a better fitting mask. We weren&apos;t comfortable taking our masks down inside so we asked to do a tasting outside, and she was nice enough to oblige- which she probably can&apos;t do when it&apos;s busier, but it was pretty quiet at 4pm when we visited. The wines were pretty sour I general, though the muscat and port were nice (and I&apos;m not normally a sweet wine drinker). Positive marks for customer service, but the slipping mask was a huge red flag for us. We realize that establishments can&apos;t always control what their customers do to take safety precautions for COVID, but there is never an excuse for staff to slack on this.",

It was $5 for a tasting of maybe six wines and it included a take home wine glass.  The tasting was very educational. We even got a chocolate kiss to pair with one of the wines.  Ended up buying two of the wines we tried, so the tasting was worth it. Don&apos;t pass this location by.",

So here&apos;s 5 of 7.\\n\\nKeels Creek is one of the newer Arkansas wineries and a bit outside the more &apos;traditional&apos; Arkansas wine town of Altus.  What you find here is something akin to a microbrewery of wine making as they focus on producing small batches of very high quality wines made from local grapes.  $5 allows you to taste six wines and keep the wine glass.  Only drawback is that, so far, they don&apos;t have any distributors so a trip to the winery is necessary when you need a bottle.  \\n\\nWorth stopping by for the excellent wines.",

We arrived after the listed closing time but were welcomed and given a full, attentive, knowledgeable wine tasting.   During the highly informative session, the nice woman who conducted the wine tasting was stung by a bee (No, I&apos;m not kidding) that had managed its way into the room.   Yet she continued the wine tasting without missing a beat.    The poor bee did not survive even though the kind lady had tried to capture it and set it free outside.     We bought several bottles of the wine after taking a short tour of the art gallery.",

Several of the white wines are acidic with a slight vinegar after taste.  Wasn&apos;t a bit hit with us as compared to Missouri wines.  The dessert wine we tasted was the best one we liked among the samples.  Owner helped on exchanging our bottle of wine for something different, which was appreciated, but one of the other workers was unwilling to assist.  Probably would not stop in again.",

However, I call it the hallway, where everything is done for registration and student debt. This &quot;hallway&quot; is full of difficulty and they make it hard to get things done. One person really helped me and she was able to walk me through every station. I realize everyone has their part in the process, but it gets tiring when everyone just passes you on to the next person over and over again. I feel bad because the lady that helped me I had a bad attitude towards at first, but she was literally the last person I spoke to after all the chaos. It&apos;s not an excuse to act that way and I feel bad for it. I just wish all the employees down that hallway were as proactive as she is. Hopefully things change next year and I can change my view on this school as a whole.",

I was super stressed out about it since all my experience in the field was with small animals, but they (Mrs. Black, and Dr. Wright) were great teachers and were very patient with us.  They are what all teachers should be like.  Sherry Hair, the academic advisor, was always very helpful whenever we had phone appointments, and you really feel like she cares about your success, just like the teachers do.    \\n\\nBut....  The school itself was difficult to work with.  These courses are very competitive to get into (which is understand). When the courses open up, you have to be by a computer to get a seat (especially towards the end of the program).  There were multiple clerical errors on my account that on 2 separate occasions caused me to not be able to enroll in the classes I needed on time. The system literally would let me put my courses in my &quot;cart&quot;, but would&apos;t let me enroll and told me to contact administration.  When I called them regarding the issue (the same day courses opened up), they told me that my mailing address was wrong (it wasn&apos;t, they&apos;ve been mailed me things in the past).  When I told them it was correct, they opened up my ability to enroll in the courses, but it was too late and the classes were full.  I had to monitor the seats every day until someone got dropped for non-payment.  \\n\\nTheir financial aid department messed up my aid EVERY semester.  FAFSA actually denied me aid once because they filled out the form so sloppily (that is actually when they told me, and they sent me copy of what they were sent).  Whenever I&apos;d called and no one answers, I&apos;d leave a message and never get a call back.  One week I called them three times and left messages every time, and I never got a call back.  When I finally got a hold of someone, they transferred me to someone&apos;s mailbox, and I&apos;d leave a message there only to be ignored there too.  Finally when I spoke with someone and told them that they messed up my paperwork, they told me to just come down next time to fill out the paperwork.  I live in Arizona.  The school is in New Mexico.  I shouldn&apos;t have to drive/fly 400 miles because they can&apos;t fill out a form correctly.  The last semester or two I didn&apos;t even bother applying for financial aid because of the hassle and put the tuition on credit cards because I&apos;d rather pay the interest than deal with them.  My last semester I had to call multiple times to get a hold of someone regarding my transcripts.  \\n\\nThe quality of this school (at least the veterinary technician program) is great, but forget it if you live in a different state.  You will have a hard time getting anything done if you have to call the front office for anything.  Whenever people ask me if they should look into this school for their certification, I tell them no and that the program is great, but the school itself is hard to work with and it&apos;s like pulling teeth to get anything done.  I have to give it 2 stars because if I had to do it over again, I wouldn&apos;t just because of the front office issues.",

However, there was one faculty member in particular (Dr. Tara Mishra in IT) who freaked many of us out and I have been wanting to complain about him for years, but kept my mouth shut, because he has this way of gagging people via subtle intimidation tactics. If he felt like you were under his spell, he would make disparaging remarks about woman, certain races and faculty members who seemed to be on his perpetual shit list. He would then add humor to his statements so it wouldn&apos;t seem too horrible. Regardless it was unprofessional and many of us lost respect for him. He was constantly making bizarre comments about how his computer is acting like so and so in the department, his ex - wife or how the system was as inefficient as the chancellor. Sometimes students heard him howling at people on the phone before he realized someone was outside his door. At times he would try to drag others into some drama he was instigating with other faculty or students. That was way out of line!! \\nIf you did not concur with him he would act like an over-inflated peacock and brag about his stellar academic history and position. This would be followed up by tales of his big shot professor brother from Australia who had powerful &apos;connections&apos; so he doesn&apos;t have to worry. I perceived this as if you don&apos;t play my game, I&apos;m going to seriously mess you up. \\nWell I will be leaving the country PERMANENTLY, off the grid for awhile so I am taking the opportunity to get this off my chest! If his big shot brother is that desperate to track me down for speaking my mind, he has more issues than &apos;Dr. Mishra&apos;. Dr. Tara Mishra, Its pathetic I have to use an alias to make this review, because I know he probably would track me down.\\nFuture students watch out for this guy! He will try to get to know you by finding out the troubles in your life and offering you saint-like assistance. If you make the mistake of telling him your problems or accepting help from him (I mean other than typical academic advising). He will carefully file all this information away and be especially nice to you. Gradually he will try to reel into some political game he is playing on campus. I have heard of him going as far as coercing people to outright lie for him (even in court). I believe he only does this to select people with whom he&apos;s been able to play on their vulnerabilities. I think that because many people who do deal with him have never heard or seen anything to give them a negative impression. If you want to have an academic relationship with him, your fine. He&apos;s pretty smart, but NEVER tell him about your sick grandma, your impoverished parents or ANY personal problems. If you do you will be the proverbial frog in water that gradually reaches boiling and become his puppet.",

During the corona virus pandemic they wanted to continue to charge all students full tuition ($1423 per month per child or $2846 total for our two kids). Our children are ages 2 and 4, and The New School essentially serves as an educational day care for our family. They would not offer a refund for the period of time that school was out so I got a lawyer involved. I have no problem paying for services as long as services are being received. They ultimately waived the payments in question, but I just found out today that they also cancelled our children&apos;s enrollment for the 2020-2021 year without our permission. We never asked to have the children removed from the school. The head of school (Nancy) will not even communicate with us directly anymore. When we reach out with questions about enrollment she simply says that only our lawyers can communicate going forward. \\n\\nWe have several friends whose children are there currently, and they are having similar issues. One couple in particular wanted to withdrawal from the school electively due to safety concerns surrounding the pandemic. Even though school has not officially started for the academic year, they were told that if they pulls out their children that they will still owe full contract price for the academic year (roughly $15,250 per child) because it is after July 1st. Hopefully, you are starting to get the picture. \\n\\nWe enjoyed the school itself and the teachers. I had no problems with the education component of the program. However, the money-driven nature of the school poisons the environment. It is not worth the ultra-high premium that they require for tuition. Maybe the K-12 experience is difference, but the contracts they have for the early childhood education is absurd. They are more interested in taking your money than doing what is right. \\n\\nI have since gladly taken my children elsewhere.",

Instead it hires people who graduated from their school in 2019 to teach! You will not be taught by experienced professionals, you won&apos;t be taught much that will make you a serious competitor in your field, you&apos;ll have to do that yourself here. If you only want to learn the most basic and OUTDATED concepts of hair, with little guidance, this is the place for you. Not to mention a few of the staff members could really use a lesson on racial sensitivity. A lot of poor behaviour is let slide in this place, a lack of professionalism, and an uncomfortable environment for students of color. The price of tuition does not reflect the quality of education at all. I was overall disappointed.",

There were students from all over the country and all over the world. There was a class where I knew two people from high school and another friend named Paul. Most classes were lectures, which I like because I sit there and take notes and there&apos;s so many people that it&apos;s hard to start drama. My government class was in a theater and the person that sat next to me was the security at the art gallery and he was so nice. Some classes were small but they were fine too and I met someone from Detroit and we did group activities in that class and they went well, no disasters.\\n\\nAn advisor told me that even though the zoology department was gone I could still go to school and then my degree would show that I graduated with a degree in zoology. The last time I saw an advisor she told me that it was untrue. I failed biology twice (I know zoology major fails biology, but trust me I&apos;m better at animal sciences) and then gave up which is sad because I wasted so much opportunity and the scholarship I received and fell behind to the point that I&apos;ve been in an out of school, well when I moved to a new state the University said they couldn&apos;t find my transcript and I did read about the University losing school records, maybe now that digital has been around for a while they can find my transcript. I don&apos;t get the Razorback thing but I&apos;ve moved around my whole life so I don&apos;t get school spirit in general. I felt that this school (I could be wrong) was moving towards becoming a sports school or training place for future athletes, which is ok.\\n\\nAfter the head of NORML came to speak the NORML Representative at the University was expelled and a lot of people thought it was because the University wanted to lessen NORML&apos;s power or get rid of the organization.\\n\\nThis was the last place where I had solid friends but some people can become violent quick without any provocation, the cops used to stop my boyfriend and I every time we would walk to the store- never got violent thank God but it happened so often that one time a cop waved at my boyfriend, my boyfriend couldn&apos;t get a job as a bagger at a grocery store because he has long hair, there&apos;s also the whole clinics are bad and make women promiscuous. There are some people in the area that still have old-fashioned beliefs and it&apos;s not just the older generation but the older generation passes it on to the younger generation. If someone is not used to this then it can be a real shock, it was for me. I was forced to move to the area by my dad so the negatives were probably ten times worse. If I had a choice I would have gone back to my birthplace to finish high school and lived with my Grandma, not that there&apos;s anything wrong when I went to Fayetteville High School but that&apos;s another review.\\n\\nSorry this is so long I do that on Yelp reviews, I wanted to write this review because I wanted to write about a good school experience because on my other school Yelp reviews I come off as some kind of nutjob.",

If you&apos;re like me and severely challenged in this area, do not be afraid.  The owners and the staff are more than helpful.  You can purchase beer, wine, soft drinks, etc which is a plus.  They have tons of items to chose to make, along with paint, stains, and all the other implements involved.  I was very pleased with what I made.  Will I be going back -- you betcha -- and more than once.  There was a sign I want in my kitchen, and another one for my bedroom, and then there was the clock .... Guess I&apos;ll have to move here.",

Of course when I started school......the federal BOE was not around to make things worse.  That being said:  My son attended the &quot;Government school system&quot; in this state from the 1st ( grade ) grade.  This was nearly equivalent to the Pre-K program  in N.Y.  \\n      We were so proud of his academic achievement, as his grades were all excellent.,  As he progressed through his &quot;Government&quot; education,he proceeded to fall behind my standards as a parent.  By the 5th (fifth) grade, it became so intolerable for me.  He could barely read, and his writing more closely resembled Egyptian Hiroglyphs ( ? ).  It was beyond maddening.  As if this wasn&apos;t enough, the bullying was horrendous.  And because my son is &quot;white&quot; he was labeled as a &quot;racist&quot; because his bullies were black ( African American -PC) we were informed that, that fact alone precluded them from being predudice ( what kind of mallarchy is that?)  That&apos;s when we found CCAT.  \\n\\n     Since the 6th Grade ( when they start to accept admissions ), my son has excelled in almost every subject, espescialy math ( thanx Mrs. Powers ), he has a love for history, and politics ( believe it or not ), and actually gets up in the morning without whining!!! imagine that.  An education that I can be proud of for my Son, without the grief of Government schools?  I&apos;m sold........I would even be happy topay for the education that my boy is getting........but the school wont let me.\\n\\n     Thank you Dr. Kathy, and the entire CCAT team.\\n\\n                                           Sincerely;\\n                                                           Mr. and Mrs.  Donald Vincent\\n\\nP.S.

The staff recommended a wilderness program because I was not doing well in their program. I was not able to do well because they didn&apos;t teach me anything and were less than helpful. The school is barely a school but the teachers are kind. Now I can&apos;t say how well the program is doing  now since it has been such a long time.

            "description": "I am a very private person that shuns social media and normally would not post anything on Yelp or any other site.  However, my wife and I read reviews regarding &quot;therapeutic&quot; boarding schools during a very stressful and troubling time when we had no answers at home (whatsoever) and seemingly no options with my increasingly troubled teen daughter.  The Yelp reviews (both positive and negative) about Greenbrier Academy were really meaningful in compelling us (as a family) to visit and consider the program as an option and so - after my daughter graduated from a year-long program a few months ago, I am writing this review during a Parents weekend at her new college-prep school where she is absolutely glowing and thriving.  My daughter&apos;s hard work and desire for a better life coupled with the Greenbrier Academy program and excellent staff (everyone at the school) made this all possible.  Worth every penny.\\n\\nAs you read these reviews, please understand that the GBA therapy curriculum focuses on the entire family dynamic (and not just the troubled teen girls).  This seems to be an unwelcome surprise to some parents who are simply unwilling to admit the part their behavior plays in an unhealthy home environment that is often the root cause of teen trouble.  If you are a parent and you do not love your kid enough to drop your ego and work just as hard via therapy to change your own destructive behavior then do everyone a favor and admit this up front.  Greenbrier can handle the rest if you do the work and admit that it&apos;s time to listen to experienced professionals construct a customized treatment plan to help your daughter figure things out for herself and set her on the path for self-reliance.\\n\\nThere are no shortcuts unfortunately.  You have to do the work.  But the Greenbrier program and Mike Beswick&apos;s excellent and experienced staff make all the difference.  You can sleep well at night knowing that your daughter is safe and that the most important things in her life at this moment are being addressed in the most fair and impactful way possible.  The results speak for themselves.  Worth every penny.",

            "description": "Our daughter&apos;s experience at the Greenbrier Academy has been truly life altering. Our 16-year old daughter suffered from anxiety and depression, self harm and suicide attempts that lasted 4 years and worsened over time, despite many interventions and therapeutic assistance. When we decided to enroll her in the Survival Skills Wilderness program at Trails Carolina, it was because we reached the end of the road. We were afraid she would not reach her 17th birthday. Our daughter graduated wilderness with a renewed sense of self esteem and a positive perspective on life and life&apos;s worth. Going from wilderness to the real world would have been challenging still so we decided to enroll her in the short-term program at the Greenbrier Academy for Girls in West Virginia. It was the best decision for us and for our daughter. The Greenbrier Academy offers excellent therapeutic and academic programs with experienced teachers and seasoned therapists, people who deeply care about the girls and their academic and therapeutic success. The program is headed by 2 amazing directors: Head of Guidance, Michael Beswick and Academic Director, Lowell Galford. I cannot begin to express our appreciation and gratitude to these 2 individuals and their teams. Their level of care, their expertise, their experience and the efforts they undertook on behalf of our daughter were tremendous. They succeeded not only in encouraging our daughter to turn her life around and change her misguided perceptions and beliefs, but they also assisted the whole family to heal and reconnenct. Mr. Galford&apos;s guidance throughout was invaluable, especially towards graduation. Mike Beswick&apos;s ability to get deep into the core issues at the 3-day Parent Program is extraordinary. Having experienced the Parent Program he leads one can easily see why he is a master at what he does. You could literally see how these young women are finally able to understand how their skewed perceptions of themselves are at the core of their struggle. And you could also see how parents are finally able to look deep into themselves and their actions and understand how it affected their children. From day 1 to day 3 the turnaround happening in front of your eyes is magical (of course it takes many months of hard work beforehand). GBA also offers the &apos;Village&apos; experience where the girls spend time away from the main building looking deep into themselves and their value as human beings. Paul Fowler, the director who runs the Village experience is a most amazing master therapist. My daughter said the most impactful experience she&apos;s had at GBA was Village, guided by Paul. She had experienced it 3 times and it was the primary experience that helped her finally realize who she is and believe there is a purpose to her life. GBA parents are also supported and guided by a highly experienced Family Therapist, Greta Lutman, who is very capable at bringing opposing forces - parents who perceive things differently - to work together in an effort to assist their child. With the assistance of all these wonderful people our daughter was able to reconnect with herself and change her misguided perceptions. And we, as parents, were able to better understand each other and our child. It was a remarkable experience that turned our lives around. Our daughter has been home for less than 10 days now and she is submitting her college applications. She is highly motivated and is looking forward to her future - which is so heartwarming. Of course not every girl is able to turn her life around in a short 4-month program. I also cannot pretend that everything at GBA was perfect. I feel the school could benefit from being better organized, especially if a point person could be assigned so parents can bring in non-therapeutic issues and concerns. We had to be persistent and highly involved all along, especially towards graduation. But GBA&apos;s ability to tailor specific therapeutic and academic programs to each and every girl is really the basis for its success and maybe a certain level of disorganization is the outcome of that... It&apos;s a small price to pay in light of the tremendous success that can be achieved. We are grateful to everyone at the GBA for bringing us our daughter back to us, strong, positive and motivated!",

            "description": "As other reviews have stated, Greenbrier Academy literally saved our daughter&apos;s life. A top student and athlete, her life suddenly began to unravel in 9th grade. Psychiatrists, therapists, even hospitalization did nothing to help her. After spending 10 weeks in an outstanding wilderness program (SUWS of the Carolinas), she spent a year at Greenbrier. There aren&apos;t enough words to describe the outstanding staff. John Grago, Mike Beswick, Lowell Galford, Kelly Beasley, Rachel Call, LJ, Paul and Greta, Sarah and Angel each played a role in our daughter&apos;s transformation, and our family will be forever grateful. The African drumming program, Village, overseas service trip, parent programs and aftercare coaching program are all part of the magic of this very unique and special school. Our daughter is now thriving as a junior in high school and has discovered the lasting treasures of joy, purpose and gratitude. Her experience was so meaningful, she is now looking ahead at becoming a wilderness therapist. I cannot recommend this school highly enough for any family in need of help and healing. Thank you Greenbrier!",

            "description": "You child would be better off in a prison.  The show they put on for our tour is NOTHING like the horrific life my daughter suffered there.  As a parent I made a mistake of taking advice from an education consultent and a 8 week program helping my daughter deal with anxiety and depression .  She was NOT at risk for alcohol  or drug abuse . She did not lie or steal and she did not harm herself or anyone else.  I have heard from others that these &quot;Wilderness &quot; programs have ties to theraputic schools.  I am starting to believe this more than ever because her so called &quot;caring &quot; therapist recomended this knowing she was not at high risk.  According to my daughters current therapist she is suffering PTSD because of the trauma she was exposed to at Greenbrier .  PLEASE DO NOT LISTEN TO EDUCATIONAL CONSULTENT or &quot;WILDERNESS PROGRAM &quot; unless you want your daughter to suffer .  I suggest you try everything to find a good theraputic school if you must after trying everything else.  I can tell you Greenbrier is NOT a good one at all. I had a gut instinct to get my daughter out of there before the year .    The food was horrible , verbal and physical assaults by other students  was a reoccuring theme , there is no real education ( be prepared for your daughter to lose a year of proper education ) , theft is as normal as going to the bathroom there ! i forgot to mention for $90,000 a year my daughters therapist was NOT licensed .  This place is a scam and so was the program that ecommended it.  They take advantage of parents that would do anything for their children.  It makes me sick that this DISGUSTING place still operates!!!",

OK, bad joke, and honestly, this is a terrific place that you should go out of your way to visit. In fact, it is quite out of the ordinary, and we think you&apos;ll enjoy and learn here. It&apos;s located on the Georgia Southern University campus just off Highway 301 south of Statesboro. \\n\\nIt is primarily a home for birds of prey: falcons, hawks, eagles, owls and the like, some of whom have been injured and are safe only in captivity. They are displayed in a 14-acre woodsy setting that somehow exists in the middle of a very busy urban campus with nearly 20,000 students. You can get up close and personal with an American Bald Eagle, a Snowy Owl (the Harry Potter owl), a Great Horned Owl, a Peregrine Falcon (fastest creature on the planet, capable of flying at 240 mph), etc. These are remarkable birds, and you are quite close to them and can see them fly in daily sessions with trainers. Really impressive, no kidding. The kiddies will love it, and so will mom and dad. There is a winding nature trail that takes you past the bird nests and enclosures as well as wetlands that show other kinds of birds. It&apos;s all most attractive and informative, and you can walk it on your own, take a guided tour or get a recorded ipod guide. \\n\\nThere&apos;s a lot more, plenty enough to fill a 2-3 hour visit. It&apos;s very cheap: $2 for adults and $1 for kids under 11 and seniors. We recommend a stop; it&apos;s about a 20-minute drive from Inerstate-16, so do plan a visit if you&apos;re driving between Savannah and Macon. Satisfaction guaranteed.",

The first exhibit we looked at was indoor with various animals in tanks. It was OK, except for the baby alligators-fairly small aquarium so I asked what happen when they grow? I was informed they swap them out for more babies from a breeder?! That bothered me somewhat. Then, I ventured out to where the raptors are displayed. Upon getting closer to the exhibit, I realized that the raptors were tethered with a maybe 3 inch tether. They kept picking up their feet and tugging at the tether..how is this humane, educational-what message does that send to impressionable young minds? This is a university affiliated center not a sideshow at the circus. I was told they are displayed like that all day. It has haunted me ever since. There has got to be a better way. Why not at least give them some sort of enclosure so they may move around freely all the time? I would not recommend visiting here...unless they choose a more humane way to educate the public.",

            "description": "Definitely one of the best schools in the state. If I absolutely had to rank them all on the merit of their academics alone, I&apos;d say #1 tied between Georgia Tech and Emory, #2 UGA, and #3 Georgia Southern.... followed by everywhere else. My sister attended both UGA and GSU though, and told me there was no difference in the quality of the education between them. The school is very progressive-thinking, and the professors tell it like it is, backed by solid science just like any top-notch university. What is different is the culture of these schools.\\n\\nFirst off, I am from Statesboro, and initially loathed the idea of going to school in my hometown. I thought that it would be a repeat of high school in south georgia... basically just camo everywhere and a low quality education, and that would be it. I was completely wrong! Sure, there&apos;s still a tiny bit of camo (like 4% of students) and some good ol&apos; boys and girls that are really closed-minded, racist, or bland (maybe 15%), but everyone else that goes here is basically the most awesome person that you will ever meet. Those are pretty good statistics, in my opinion. The people here will surprise you. If you never really found your niche anywhere else, my suggestion would be to come to Georgia Southern. The students here are really like family. \\n\\nThe campus is also absolutely stunning. 90% of the buildings are new construction and totally amazing. The technology here is top notch, in every field. The RAC is amazing, with tons of workout equipment, and gear that you can even rent and take with you! Eagle entertainment offers tons and tons of activities for the students, including de-stressers during exam time (ever wanted to pie someone in the face or smash up an old car?), concerts, food activities, and so much more.\\n\\nGSU is also located in a quiet town that has a surprising amount of fun things to do and lots of jobs for students. The life in statesboro just can&apos;t be beat. The attitude is very much &quot;work hard - play hard.&quot; GSU has a notorious party culture, sure, but what can we say? We&apos;re high achievers too. I had well above an A average when I graduated, and not for any lack of fun. That&apos;s because Georgia Southern is a school of balance. GSU students like to study their behinds off at Henderson library as much as they like relaxing by a pool with a drink in their hands, soaking up the sweet southern sun.\\n\\nAnd parents rejoice! The laws will be changing in July of this year, prohibiting all persons under the age of 21 from entering any of the bars, and making it much more difficult for students to drink underage. GSU is also located in a dry county, meaning no liquor is available to be purchased in any store here... and the nearest place to get liquor? Well, it&apos;s nearly 45 minutes away - more than far enough to deter most students from going to get it.\\n\\nAs an alumni, I feel really confident saying that Georgia Southern is a special place in this world. It is a lot of fun compared to other colleges, which is something that you should want for yourself if you&apos;re considering going here, and for your child if you&apos;re a parent. The experiences I had here were once in a lifetime, and I would not trade them for going to any other school. \\n\\nThere is also something about Georgia Southern that brings students together in a way that I have never seen again anywhere else. Maybe it&apos;s because all of the freshmen are required to stay in the dorms together, maybe it&apos;s the traditions like FYE, first night out, the lantern walk, etc... we all know each other. We all have been through the same experiences. Eagles love each other, look for each other, and stand by each other when they see another eagle in need. It was a great source of pride for me to have found friends that would stand by my side through anything at this school, and those friendships have remained intact despite the fact that we graduated several years ago.\\n\\nAll-in-all, Georgia Southern is a wonderful school and I&apos;m very proud that I went here for my undergraduate degree. Once an eagle, always an eagle!",

            "description": "Alex Hall\\nProfessor Greene\\nComposition I\\n2 July 2015\\n                                                          Restaurant Review\\n\\n Georgia Southern University enrolls thousands of students every year, each of them having their own acquired taste. There are two main eating facilities, the Dining Commons seems to be the favored one. In order to satisfy many different taste buds of students, the variety that they offer is unlimited. They have learned how to make the students feel at home again, by giving them a little taste of it. \\n The identity of the Dining Commons varies in many different ways. They have a variety of choices that fit many cultural backgrounds. Having to capture such a broad audience in the food world their taste has to be indescribable. \\n As you walk in, a sweet face that simply swipes your card and says, &quot;Hope you enjoy.&quot; The sweetness and strong smell of coffee fills your lungs. After staying up all night writing papers, this is where students all stop first hoping to get that needed boost of energy. Bright colors hit your eyes as you walk pass, another sweet face greets you at the smoothie station. Students love a refreshing smoothie after soaking up the dreadful heat from the long dreary walks to class. Walking past the smoothie you start to smell the food from the Traditional section, the little salad bar, Signature, the bar that serves a variety of pizza and pasta, Brick Oven, the Backyard Gourmet, and Mongos. \\n The Traditional bar is just like being at home, but they offer more choices. They provide home-cooked meals that bring back memories of grandma&apos;s house. The smell of fried chicken and hearing the sizzle of the grease it&apos;s just like being at Sunday dinner with my family. They serve things from mashed potatoes, fried chicken, green beans, black-eyed peas, and fried okra. Traditional has to be one of the most favored sections by simply providing the feeling of being at home in your heart. They also serve a nice breakfast. Walking to the back early in the morning smelling fresh bacon, sausage, hot simmering biscuits, two kinds of grits, eggs, and hot pancakes. Nothing feels better than filling up on breakfast right before class.\\n The salad bar isn&apos;t the most favored by the whole, but the athletes love it. They provide a variety of salad options. Including many different types of lettuce, toppings, fruits, and salad dressing. The sandwich and wrap station is also included in this section. This is set up similar to Subway, providing different choices of bread, meats, toppings, and sauces. Although not many people visit this part of the Dining Commons, when you do your taste buds immediately are satisfied. They also make hot fresh omelets for breakfast if you don&apos;t like scrambled eggs from the Traditions, where you get to choose between different cheeses and vegetables to go inside.\\n Brick Oven, is like our own pizza joint. There&apos;s nothing better than having 7 different kinds of pizza aligned with another table including, bread sticks, and 4 different pastas to choose from. There is also a special dietary section connected called No Whey. Even if you don&apos;t like the pasta dishes that they serve, you can instead make your own with separate noodles and a variety of sauces to chose from. These two are the second most favored. Who doesn&apos;t like a nice slice of pizza, a quick and easy enough to eat and make it to class in time. It isn&apos;t just called Brick Oven because they serve pizza, it&apos;s because they actually use a brick oven installed behind the stand. \\n The infamous Gourmet has all things fried and different salads. They provide hot fries, burgers, chicken tenders, onion rings, sweet potato fries, fried chicken sandwiches, chicken salad, crab salad, and potato salad. Being over by the Gourmet makes me think of a hot summer day at a barbeque. The smell of burgers and fresh grilled hotdogs makes my mouth water just thinking about it. They also provide you with so many different sauces, like ketchup, mustard, honey mustard, barbeque sauce, and mayonnaise. \\n Right behind the Gourmet is Mongos, where they have an Asian themed Mongolian grill station with made-to-order dishes. This part of the dining is where you can fresh eggrolls, bourbon chicken, salmon, shrimp, all things teriyaki, and sweet and sour chicken. Right behind this stand there is a big iron stove where they cook your food to your liking. Being in front of this stand is like being at a Miyabi&apos;s, if you haven&apos;t been to one it&apos;s very similar to Mongos. There&apos;s nothing like seeing your food being cooked in front of you, and steam reaching the top of the ceiling.\\n As you can see the Dinning Commons provides so many different options for everyone. They are able to fill everyone&apos;s acquired taste at any given time of day. I would say that their identity is pretty much laid out for them and fits perfectly in Statesboro, Georgia! They definitely deserve a 5 out of 5 stars!",

I appreciated the head heart hand motto of the school because it taught him to love the lord and act on that love. \\n\\nHe said the surrounding town is smaller than a button and sometimes the folks there give him a weird look because he has blue hair but in general he was treated well. \\n\\nThe school was very accommodating and helped him go through the trauma of my wife&apos;s and my separation. He went through a rough patch and we are so blessed that he had his friends to guide him through this stressful time. They loved the lord and loved him so well and Steven was so good to him, helping him with his studies and just being a shoulder to cry on. \\n\\nI cannot stress enough that this school is well worth the money, will teach you to love the lord and your fellow man. In fact we even got to welcome Steven into our family and it was unfortunate that Steven only got to spend 2 years there because he and the staff decided that there was a better place elsewhere for him after the wedding. \\n\\nBest 168k we spent on our boys.",

We had great community during my time there (08-12), and still have some friends to this day from there even though it&apos;s 6 hours from my home town. The spiritual emphasis there is unparalleled, as I felt like I was on a spiritual high for much of my time there. Many of the people there love God deeply, and it rubs off. I also loved the area; if you&apos;re down for adventure and beautiful scenery and prime locations for finding more to do, NWA is the area to be . Loved it.",

John Brown chooses professors who desire to teach in a way that will prepare their students to use their gifts to glorify God. They&apos;ve got the best art program I&apos;ve ever experienced, and everyone on campus is aware of how important each major is to serve in Gods kingdom and better the world. \\nHowever, if you are a person who wants to party in college, John Brown is not for you. John Brown only requires you to not participate in things like drinking, gambling, premarital sex, or anything that might lead you to participate in those things for the time that you are enrolled at John Brown. \\nI&apos;ve never seen a college like this. Everyone I&apos;ve talked to who has experienced public colleges says that they are relieved and refreshed by the JBU environment. It&apos;s very hard to find a place like this in the US. I&apos;ve had the best experience. \\nIf you have any questions message me!",

So much so that when their dad decided to go back for an engineering degree at age 52, there was no other place he would rather be. Their engineering graduates have a 100% job placement rate. The financial aid is top notch. It is a Christian school without the guilt but they do hold the students to a high moral standard. The oldest dorms are under refurbishment right now. The others are standard, basic dorm rooms with everything you need but not fancy. There are some town houses and apartments on campus for upper classmen and many rent apartments off campus. Siloam Springs is a wonderful Christian community. Alcohol sales were just approved a few years ago. Low crime. Nice Hispanic community. Lots of jobs. Beautiful scenery.",

Like Rebecca said, it&apos;s got it&apos;s faults, but it&apos;s got it&apos;s ups as well.\\n\\nIt&apos;s a Christian university, and that can be felt pretty much everywhere on the campus. They&apos;re starting to be more open to homosexuals attending the school, but still things like smoking cigarettes/drinking (even if you&apos;re of age) will get you into huge trouble. The thing is they have you sign a community covenant at the beginning of each school year, so you&apos;re agreeing to the rules. I&apos;ve been told that if you don&apos;t want to abide by the rules, then you don&apos;t really need to be attending school here. Makes sense to me.\\n\\nWhile it has it&apos;s downs the ups far outweigh it. I actually like that they don&apos;t allow drinking/parties in the dorms. Don&apos;t get me wrong, we still have plenty of laughs and good times, but we also get our work done. If there was alcohol flowing at all times I&apos;m pretty sure there would be a lot less studying going on. \\n\\nOverall a great school, and I would recommend it if you&apos;re looking for a solid education and don&apos;t mind not having a party within spitting distance every night.\\n\\nMessage me if you want more info.",

Having no idea what I was getting into with this new software program, I now feel I can navigate my way through the basics.  \\nIt was a long day, but the instructor, Chris, kept it casual but informative, gave breaks throughout the day and was very patient with everyone&apos;s very elementary skills.  I look forward to finding the time to go back to take the intermediate and advanced courses soon.  It was well worth the time and money well spent.",

I have NEVER been so disappointed in a business ever. To embarrass the students by sharing private information in front of the whole class, to teach them about drugs beyond what was technically necessary, to yell at the customer and not listen to the concern of the parent (I preferred NOT to have the male teacher be alone in the car with my daughter on drives, and I wanted to sit in the back of the class room for a few days to make sure we were comfortable with the class) was such a disheartening experience.  It turned out very badly for all involved.\\n\\nIf you, as a future customer,  would like more information - feel free to reach out to us.  We will be honest and truthful in our experience.",

At first I didn&apos;t know what to expect because I had never even heard of reiki. I was already dabbling in crystals, with sage, and meditation so I was open to the idea of reiki. After the first few sessions I knew that this was something I needed. I never expected what I would take from our sessions, but she has helped me to realize and allow myself to let go, allow myself to heal, love myself, loving others and just understanding more of my spirit and the journey that I am on. \\n\\nI also got my first ever acupuncture treatment from her as well. She made sure I was very comfortable because I was nervous about the needles. I had talk about how bad my anxiety was about travel as well as pain in my shins that I&apos;ve had. We did a treatment right before I went on a trip and it was the best vacation I ever had. I wasn&apos;t anxious one bit! There were times I couldn&apos;t even go on vacation because my anxiety was crippling or if I made it I was suffering. That trip was amazing, I had moments of anxiety but nothing I couldn&apos;t work through. I was also complaining about shin pain as well. I have had shin pain for as long as I can remember for the last 10 years of working in the restaurant buisness. I figured it was just me over working myself, or maybe just too long of a shift that day. I got an acupuncture treatment and I haven&apos;t had that pain since. 10/10 high recommend 5 stars \\n\\nErin is amazing at what she does. She&apos;s passionate, knowledgeable, hilarious, and comfortable to be around. Making sure that you understand that you as a person are amazing. Thank you for everything that you do, you deserve every bit of praise. May the universe be kind to you",

My first session I didn&apos;t know what to expect but she made the process so easy almost like I was talking with a friend I&apos;ve known for years. Any judgements about myself, the situation, or doing something new just floated away and I was finally present for myself. I even added acupuncture into my energy sessions which is something I never seen myself doing but she explained everything in detail and eased my mind and it was a beautiful experience. Through this time of knowing Erin we have worked on so many obstacles I felt like I could never tell or come out of. I&apos;ve seen such a transition in myself that I&apos;ve been certified through Erin for starting my own energy work journey. I feel like I finally have a way to give back to myself and have UNCONDITIONAL LOVE for myself.  Thank you so much Erin for creating a safe space and having a beautiful soul",

I brought my son here because the owner&apos;s husband/father, a vet, saw one of our horses and she wanted to be sure we knew they had a new driving school.  The husband was nice and very competent so I thought this would be the case in the operation of the driving school It was a newer small business, I decided to invite some other moms to bring their kids to a summer of driving instruction with Janet. It did not go as I had hoped. Listen, these boys are the cream of the crop at school. No trouble, never a detention, never an issue out of any of them and they are also involved in football together. \\n\\nToday I had to call the police on Midwest Five Star Driving School after my son was dumped in the dark for not having his permit for an observation, though the owner had a copy.  It was snowing, freezing and her words to him were, &quot;Give me your permit.. Then get out of the car.&quot;.   Period. He had no ride, she didnt ask him if he could call his mom, there was no place to wait and it isnt a populated or safe area.  The police had to wait with him while I arranged for emergency transportation. Thank God his phone had a charge.  I feel the school should make arrangements to call a parent in this situation.  My husband is also a vet and owns a small business. I can tell you if we left a client or patient abandoned in a dark parking lot in the snow in winter people would go CRAZY. Why would you do it to a 15 year old boy who lives down the road from you, Janet?  \\n\\nMy son was not happy on nearly every day of class or drives.  My son reported to me that he accidentally hit the gas and lurched the school car forward. He was embarassed and wasnt expecting that and apologized. He was used to driving a more powerful car at home.  His sister drives it to drop him off and he tells me the instructor, Janet, said to him that &quot;Yeah, we all know you drive a truck,&quot; as if he was bragging about it which would be out of character and was not his intent. He felt very degraded by Janet Kapraun that day and upset with the way she taught the classes, her interactions with his friends and her attitude toward them.  My son tells me he felt humiliated and degraded and angry when she spoke in certain ways to his friends at class.  I never had these issues at Top Driver.  There are many other Janet-isms to report but I am running out of space. \\n\\nThis seems to be a mother/son operation. So if you need to complain you could be met with no result which is what occurred with my complaints to their business. The son takes the complaints and was defensive.  The other mothers I took felt the same and I feel embarassed to have recommended Midwest Five Star Driving School owned by Jeff Kapraun and owner or employee Janet Kapraun of Harvard, Illinois. \\n\\nI am calling the police department back now...",
