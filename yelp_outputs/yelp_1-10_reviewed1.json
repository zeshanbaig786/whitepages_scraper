While my wife was dropping our kids off, the lady in the kitchen cooking came out &amp; told me that my youngest (2 years old) was being neglected in class &amp; that she would have to go in and take care of him all the time bc they would always ignore him &amp; leave him on the floor crying. When my wife was told this, she immediately told them that i would be calling corporate over this &amp; an hour later i received a phone call saying our kids were no longer welcome to go to Childcare Network. Then, i was forced to pay the rest of the time anyway even though they were kicked out prior to the months end. The Director, at the time of all this, was even there when my wife gave birth to our kids, so i think that speaks for itself on how much they&apos;d care about your kids. People working there and the corporate office are negligent and will stick it to the customer before admitting fault.",

THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A PHILOSOPHY.\\n\\nA review of any college is perhaps more a ridiculous proposition than reviewing other things because, in addition to the usual vagaries of opinion, a college of any size will not be experienced by two people in remotely the same way. Are you a student (whether traditional or not; whether serious or not -- I&apos;ll not say, whether intelligent or not), an office worker, administrator, instructor, or someone attached to the college in some cooperative capacity, or a combination of any of these? NWACC is large enough to encompass a plethora of experiences. So, a review that begins, &quot;My algebra teacher was a bore,&quot; wouldn&apos;t begin to characterize the potential of any community college.\\n\\nAs for me (who functions as an employee, one that has worked at other community colleges and universities), I enjoy the campus, which is nicer than many other campi (noun, Latin plural). That is important; I like clean lines. The library, which is always the clincher, will more than adequately support most any academic endeavor, for both student and professional, with friendly assistance. As for the education, accessibility is stressed, I have clearly seen, which is good news for many. And, out of the classroom, college culture is promoted in a variety of ways, for those who require that.\\n\\nWhat else can be said? Yeah, that one guy cut me off in the parking lot. Rotten teen drivers! And, they don&apos;t offer the Vietnamese courses I would like to take ... maybe even throw in a field trip to Saigon. Oh, well. Still, I&apos;m a fan.",

It is a children&apos;s theater aimed a creating productions geared towards children (and adults since I have loved every performance I have been too) and classes/camps/plays for children to learn about acting, singing, performing, etc. \\n\\nI recently signed up one of my kids to do a 6 week long class here and she is loving it. The staff are all great teachers and great with the kids. They have different classes/camps for different age groups. The six week courses each have a different theme. I also think the price is super reasonable and affordable. \\n\\nI have seen a few of the Trike theater plays performed at the Walton Arts Center in Fayetteville and they have all been great. They have a specific stage at the arts enter that is smaller (think a large movie theatre size) and it is really enjoyable. It is enjoyable because it is more intimate and the kids feel more involved and like they can participate and interact with the play in that setting. \\n\\nGreat theater and performing arts school/group!",

The teachers truly care and build a relationship with each child and family. The director is very flexible in regard to working with your schedule needs. I especially love the diversity of the students and teachers at the school and the focus on teaching kids about other countries and cultures.",

Therefore, my wife and I drove from another state to take a tour and were told by our daycare to do it unannounced to get a true feeling on how they interact with the kids and with you. We entered to building... Yes we entered the building and walked around for 15 minutes looking (without a code) and did not run into a singleness member. This should have been our first warning to run but I gave them the benefit and tracked down a worker due to no staff being in their offices either. The staff member said they were celebrating a event and said tonsit and wait and the director would come out and speak with us. So we waited for 15 minutes and subsequently I went and tracked down another staff member and asked if the director had time for us today. Finally the director came out of a room and seemed irritated to even speak with us. She said no tours could be given today. I asked if we could come back later in day to do a tour and her response was no I have to pick my kids up at 3. I then asked her if anyone else was available to give a tour and her response was no. After this attempt my wife and I left. Please don&apos;t bring your kids to this daycare due to safety concerns with anybody being able to walk in /out unannounced and the unpleasant staff that could possibly take care of your kids.",

There wasnt any  prior intimation, nor were parents concerns invited. I mean how can you demote a child to a lower school program, there is definitely some big difference between the two levels.   I observed that the children in early preschool were mostly exposed to television and showed stuff like Curious George ... \\n\\nThough we have relocated and thankfully out of the class otherwise i would have to wait for my child to go to Junior again only if there was any vacancy again.  So weird !!!\\n\\nThe teachers, esp Ms Becky, junior preschool was great... however the school management is not very friendly.",

I will speak for the infant/toddler rooms only for this is where my child was at during his enrollment. There is high turnover with the teachers, inconsistent structure, sporadic or sometimes no updates on child throughout the day on the &quot;daily connect app&quot;, dirty rooms, children sharing their belongings, etc. I had a Tylenol bottle come up empty after just buying it! Was this given to my child? Other children? Nobody seemed to know anything about it. My child came home with a huge scratch on his arm and there is still a scar from it. Again, none of the teachers knew what happened. I would not recommend this place for your child especially if you are like me and want to have good interactive relationships with your child&apos;s teachers and be informed about your child at all times.",

First off, yes I will agree with Rachel J&apos;s review below about the previous asst director, however since we started she left about a month after and things couldn&apos;t be any better!  I get updates on my little girl throughout the day and pictures as well!  I love all the art projects they do with the little ones and book reading, exploring, playing outdoors, etc.... No matter how young, they have a curriculum planned daily for your little one.  I don&apos;t feel like I could even come close to matching all the fun things they do here with my little one.  It seems like she comes home weekly learning and saying something new.  I just love it!  And the teachers and staff here are OUTSTANDING!  You can tell they genuinely care for your child and not sure how, but everyone knows her by name, office staff and other teachers she&apos;s never had.  \\n\\nI will add, no one paid me to write this, just an honest review because I know how hard it is to find GREAT childcare.  I think I toured over half of them in the area and if it&apos;s not the BEST then it&apos;s not for my little one.  Thanks Cadence staff for being so great!!",

Annalyn, the director has done a wonderful job getting to know all the students and families and making us all feel welcome and part of the Cadence family. Any questions or concerns I&apos;ve had have been immediately answered or addressed. \\nAll of the teachers have great attitudes and genuinely care about their students. They provide plenty of one on one time throughout the day, and even extra TLC when needed. Miss Abbie, the lead infant teacher does a fantastic job and is passionate about her babies. She has worked with my twins through several transitions already and continues to teach them new skills everyday. We would love for her to move to toddlers with them!\\n\\nOverall, Cadence Academy is a top notch school in Rogers and comes highly recommended.

In addition to several well appointed Montessori classrooms they also have a few unique features such as an outdoor classroom where children are learning life skills including gardening and caring for animals. The school also has a natural playground with features literally carved from the forested hillside.\\n\\nI see my little boy growing into a confident, warm, caring, and intelligent young man at Walnut Farm. He loves to read and do math. He is fascinated by and in love with every kind of animal. He loves his teachers and his classmates. \\n\\nWhen kids reach school age, we rely on the school to mold them into the people we want them to be. Schools have the kids from 8 to 3 most days, leaving just 4 or 5 hours with their parents. If they are going to play that big a role in the development of my child... then I feel strongly about choosing a school that not only does a good job educating my child, but also teaches him to grow up tolerant of the many differences in people around the world. \\n\\nThey take children from toddlers through around the equivalent of 6th grade.",

We absolutely love the school and it&apos;s staff. The teachers are truly special and amazing! They are witty, kind, knowledgable,compassionate, creative, and have such a wealth of experience. We have a lot of experience with having been through 6 preschools between both of my kids. We love the involvement with nature and the lack of electronics in the school. My daughter learned to read in the past year, and her confidence is amazing. She has also learned great conflict resolution skills (communication) and real life skills (ex: setting/clearing the table). This school has a great peaceful &amp; positive enviornment  that is very welcoming. I am so grateful that they are here!",

We wanted a place where his natural curiosity can be fostered. We wanted a place where tolerance, acceptance, and peace are just a natural part of the day. \\n\\nNot only is he receiving core curriculum (reading, writing, math, science), but he is exposed to rich extras such as Spanish, nature education, life skills, art, and music. Children learn to investigate and research from a very young age. The learning is sparked by interest - so the child is more invested in it. \\n\\nThe Montessori method truly is remarkable and Walnut Farm does a lovely job of presenting an authentic experience. The classrooms - both indoor and outdoor - are led by caring, passionate teachers where the students are encouraged to engage with the lessons. They are empowered to learn and given the necessary tools to do so.\\n\\nIf you have a child between 18 months and 12 years and want more than just a traditional education, consider a visit to Walnut Farm. It is my greatest hope that you see what my family saw the very first time we set foot on the campus.",

They have an outdoor classroom with a teacher outside at all times for instruction.  I think that is amazing!  There are two trained teachers in each room.

Nodin has been with this location for about 4 months now. He&apos;s 2 1/2 and an only child. We moved here from Denver in August and it hasn&apos;t been the easiest transition for him. Enrolling him at La petite Bentonville Ar. has been the one of the best choices as parents we&apos;ve made. We recently started potty training and genuinely had no idea how much work time and stress can accompany that life change. Our son who has always slept through the night started getting up multiple times each night as he curiously wanting to grasp this new toilet concept. I more often than not drop him off at La Petite Academy after having had almost no sleep  and every morning Whitney and I go over his progress and she gives suggestions and tips I would not know otherwise. She is completely dedicated to every child in the building and having someone to answer my questions, tactically make me aware of potential mistakes, while still making me feel validated as a mother has truly been a blessing. I trust her and the staff completely while my son is i their care  and to me that&apos;s priceless.",

The director and teachers really work together with the therapists to help our son get ready for kindergarten.  Joe was not speaking many words when he started, and his language has increased and his skills have improved where he can attend a general education classroom next year.  La Petite is truly a safe, fun, educational, and perfect place for our son to learn and make friends.

I highly recommend them.  Their website has a very detailed calender of when classes are held.  I will be using them for my renewals as long as they keep holding classes!",

They&apos;re essentially selling a product they don&apos;t have. Granted the place must be good if they&apos;re always full, but they completely lack integrity when it comes to getting new families to sign up. We paid the $100 registration fee and were told that they would have an opening in a few months. We&apos;ve waited for more than a year and still haven&apos;t gotten in. I tried to work with them on getting my money back before posting anything, but it doesn&apos;t matter that they blatantly sold me on something they don&apos;t have. The only thing that matters to them is the contract I had signed which protects them from their dishonesty.",

I know this firsthand, also the &quot;teachers&quot; love to take a nap with the children. I&apos;m sorry, but when is it ever ok to nap when the kids are? Who is responsible when they get up and there is not an adult to watch them? I would not recommend the school to anyone.",

This is the third college I&apos;ve been to and by far the worst. The biggest reason I am leaving such an awful review is the fact that the financial aid office has refused to process my fafsa unless my parents commit tax fraud. They were separate at the time but the school wants them to refile as married not separate. I also owe the school a bit of money since scholarships didn&apos;t cover enough and fafsa wasn&apos;t processed so I had to solely rely on that. So I got a loan but I was told it wouldn&apos;t be active until the first day of classes. That means yet again my attempt to relieve the hold and register for classes was a bust. Next up is the food, the cafeteria seems to constantly under cook food. More specifically the chicken is almost always raw. And third is the teachers, but most specifically an english teacher named Mrs. Carter. Who gave me numerous zeros for assignments I turned in without any explanation why causing me to go from a B to an F in the last few weeks of classes. All in all I do not recommend attending this university.",
