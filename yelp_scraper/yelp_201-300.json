We didn&apos;t have to rush. Just before his second birthday, and after about 6-7 daycare tours, I called NALC. They answered the phone the FIRST TIME. I spoke with a very friendly teacher that told me the director was out. I asked when I could stop by and she said ANYTIME. I went that afternoon and the afternoon assistant knew I was going to be stopping by. She took us on a tour and was very friendly. She gave me the information. I spoke with the director the next day and she was aware of me coming by and calling. My son started the next week! They truly care about him. The staff communicates and everyone seems to know what is going on. I&apos;m not sure how, but his teacher has taught him colors and shapes and several numbers in his three months there (he turned 2 in August)! His speech is more clear, his attitude and personality have also further developed. There is just a wonderful feeling at NALC. It&apos;s clean. It&apos;s secure. It&apos;s a fun environment. And each teacher really cares about their kids. I love that other teachers know my son&apos;s name and he tells them hey and bye and waves at them. NALC is much more than just a &quot;daycare.&quot; They do take the time to educate children. Price is extremely reasonable. And they communicate with parents so much better than I ever thought. Everything there is above my expectations. Highly recommend this facility. You should give them a chance to love your child(ren) the way they love mine!\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":5,\"reviewCount\":1}}"]},

I cannot even begin to express how much she has grown and how much she has learned in her time at this school. Her teachers Miss Candi and Miss Claire feel like family to us and are so loving and patient with our rambunctious, over zealous, sweet little girl. It is so heart warming to see Miss Claire hugging Shelby on the Watch me Grow web cam or to see Shelby laughing and playing with her friends on the play ground. \\n\\nHer teacher Miss Candi is so communicative and makes herself very accessible via the Shutterfly share app. She posts pictures of the kids every week on the app - which is 100% secure and only able to be viewed by the parents - and writes a summary of what the children are learning in the classroom. I know this must be time consuming for her to do every week but as a parent I appreciate it so much. \\n\\nShelby has mastered so many new skills in her year at Kids Town. She can count incredibly high, recognize most of the ABCs, and is SO MUCH more focused. She has learned about geography, botany, entomology, science, math, etc. She has developed a love of learning, a new sense of adventure, and made so many wonderful friends. \\n\\nLike I mentioned in my original review, the school offers so many extra circular activities for the kids. I have enrolled Shelby in Amazing Athletes and Mini-Kickers Soccer. Both are wonderful for her since she has a ton of energy. She loves learning about the sports and being apart of a team. Plus, the fact that these 3rd party companies come to the school is is huge bonus! Being a mother who works full time it is hard to make time for sports and such. The school also offers Zumba, music programs, and more. \\n\\nThe staff at KTMS is also incredibly wonderful. The owner Miss Mehrma and her daughter the assistant director Mahsa are beyond amazing. They are both so loving and kind to ALL of the kids enrolled at their school. I have seen Miss Mehrma in the nap room helping the children go to sleep, and Miss Mahsa comforting children who miss their mommies and daddies. The nap teachers Miss Shireen and Miss Denise are so very patient with the kids during Naptime. Miss Jessica and Miss Tammy who watch the early drop off kids are so kind and sweet. Miss Patricia who is Miss Mahsa&apos;s backup is also fantastic. \\n\\nI will be so sad when Shelby graduates from KTMS. As long as we can afford it, we will keep her there as long as possible!

I had enrolled my 1 &amp; 3 yo daughters in this program for just one week (my one year old was in the 3 day a week program and I pulled her out on day 3). There were several reasons I chose to stop taking my girls to this program.  But the one issue that drew the line for me was when I saw my one year old sitting for extended periods of time in the table that has chairs built into the center. On day 2, I asked the teacher why she had been sitting for so long and she answered by saying that I had put her in the wrong shoes that day. Even after I spoke with them, they still continued to make her sit in the table chair for extended periods of time. I listed some additional reasons I took her out below. \\n\\nThe cons:\\n- one year old class: one of the teachers doesnt speak English. The other teacher let&apos;s the kids sit down for extended periods of the day in tables with chairs in them. There is no structured play even though it&apos;s a Montessori school. The teacher would just put toys on the table for kids to play with while they sit in the table. \\n- 3 - 6 year old class: the teachers don&apos;t interact or show any emotion with the children. Not a nurturing environment. \\n- teachers don&apos;t seem to have any training \\n- when I would pick up my girls, there was no one to tell me how they did, if they napped, how many wet diapers. \\n- my one year old developed a diaper rash after only 3 days there...

Knew nothing about Montessori before beginning, and very impressed at all the skills my child has learned and their whole approach to early childhood education: it is not a daycare, it is a school. In addition to learning and development, the school wears out the kids, lots of outdoor playtime on their covered playgrounds and physical activities throughout the day. Teachers are all very easy to reach whenever you have questions or concerns about the class or your child. The work and &quot;gifts&quot; that come home are priceless and seemingly never ending, had to dedicate a whole wall to our childs assignments! They also make doing special things for kids birthdays very easy, and have special activities and projects for many, many holidays and cultures throughout the year; and lots of special summer activities. \\n\\nOnly negative:Parking can be tough when big events are going on, and traffic on Sycamore can be ugly.\"},{\"author\":\"Emily L.\",\"datePublished\":\"2019-02-07\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"I cannot say enough about KTMS. We have been bringing our twins here for almost 2 years and we have never doubted or been disappointment with our decision. When looking for childcare/schooling, we knew we wanted Montessori based educational program. We took our time touring and making sure we found the best fit for our boys. Out of the four different centers that we toured, KTMS was the only one that I felt welcomed and comfortable immediately upon entering. Ms. Ildi has been the boys&apos; teacher almost the entire time and we have grown quite attached to her.

The kids love learning in this environment. My 4 year old has learned numbers and letters and math and sight words and how to clean up after herself and how to take care of the materials.

It was a difficult choice for us to send her anywhere, but I have to say that I am so glad we did and that we chose Kid&apos;s Town. This school is a delight and an amazement. What could be more important than the welfare and education of one&apos;s child, particularly at so young an age? These teachers excel. They are family to us. \\n\\nI have seen my child grow in leaps and bounds. At three she is counting and spelling. She sings and plays with passion and joy. She interacts so effortlessly with others and so much of this is the direct result of her experience at Kid&apos;s Town. From her first day there, she has been treated with love, compassion, and care. This facility adheres to the Montessori passion and philosophy and has made me a believer. Children are such natural learners, and at this school, they will learn as well as can be hoped. The teachers and administrators are always available to discuss your child&apos;s progress, hopes, and challenges. I honestly love these people.\\n\\nThe facility has recently grown. It is beautifully constructed and always clean. I have been to other schools when I was looking for a place to send my child and their buildings and grounds were far and away the cleanest in appearance (not to mention smell). Seriously, how many other facilities just tolerate urine smell is beyond me. Not Kid&apos;s Town....always clean and fresh, and that&apos;s not a small matter to my mind.\\n\\nWe are moving out of state soon and we will be so sad to leave this place behind.

I got a dozen eggs and, let me tell you, they were maybe the best eggs I&apos;ve ever had. Bright orange yolks, rich and flavorful. I have been dreaming about these eggs ever since! I just haven&apos;t had a chance to go back and get more! \\n\\nThe staff running their booth was SO nice. Super chatty and really lovely. With my egg purchase, they generously gave me a lovely tote bag (which I&apos;ve been using regularly toting around my laptop!) and some literature on the farm itself. I learned so much! I discovered that they have a huge space in Chelsea right off M-52 (129 acres!) that you can tour, a garden you can volunteer in, they also offer classes, etc. They even have an amphitheater where they host events. Next week they&apos;re hosting a local theatre company&apos;s performance of A Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream. They also have a summer day camp for kids to learn about ecology, art, and science. \\n\\nTheir website explains that they,&quot;have an organic garden, a mushroom forest, a commercial aquaponics system located in our fully-automated greenhouse, 10 acres of pasture for raising happy and healthy livestock, and spring-fed ponds stocked with rainbow trout.&quot; But as far as I know you have to contact them ahead of time to take advantage of that, you can&apos;t just stop in. \\n\\nCan&apos;t wait to try more items from them and take a tour of the farm sometime very soon!\"},{\"author\":\"Alyssa P.\",\"datePublished\":\"2020-09-09\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"We were so excited that Robin Hills Farm opened up at the time that it did!

There are big mirrors, couches, tables, and plenty of outlets to use if necessary. It also has a nice overhang of the reception downstairs.

Located just a short distance outside of beautiful, downtown Chelsea Michigan the farm has plenty of parking.  They were, last time I was there, working on smoothing the entrance area for handicapped patrons but will assist in every way to get everyone up to the restaurant/lodge/headquarters.\\n\\nThe grounds are beautiful.  They have been recently carved out of an old farmstead that had been worked by a family of Michiganders for generations.  They now display various types of farmland landscapes that are common across Michigan.  They are sensitive to the environment and work to support and increase the wildlife in the area.  The work they do also involves ensuring that the plants and other creatures that inhabit the area are kept in stable and then growing populations.\\n\\nIn Spring you may be able to see the elusive Blue Bird nesting and flying about.  There are turtles, frogs and the deer sure like the grazing. \\nThere are beautiful locations for outdoor parties and weddings.  Plenty of space for other activities too.  \\n\\nRobin Hills Farm is not short on science either.  Their organic vegetable fields and their greenhouse which features cutting edge aquaculture as well as cold weather growing facilities is a wonderful sight to behold and learn from.  They were very kind to us when we were there.  My favorite part about the place is that everyone who goes there seems to belong.

We attended a Yelp event over the weekend, so I learned a lot about the farm and you should know this place is a work in progress.  They&apos;ve been around for 3 years and claim to be an Eco-friendly farm.  The place isn&apos;t officially open to the public, though they are hoping to be so as early as November.  It also isn&apos;t a full production farm, as it&apos;s geared as much to education and learning as it is to farming.  For example, they have a pretty cool vegetable garden which includes two full size green houses, but they aren&apos;t supplying the country side with produce.  You will be able to find their produce at local farmer&apos;s markets.\\n\\nI loved the place.  It&apos;s big and has several areas to visit (garden, animal pastures, an aquaponics building, ponds) but isn&apos;t like going to a working farm, so you weren&apos;t overwhelmed with anything.  The pigs and other animals were friendly (pigs were a blast) and the employees did a good job educating us.\\n\\nI had a geat vibe from the place, and I think as it opens up, it will be a great place to visit.

This is a review of that space.\\n\\nThe location is quite pretty, but be forewarned that it is, in significant ways, still a construction zone. The parking area is unfinished, as is the driveway that leads in to the complex. Ticket sales and vending (high-priced snacks, farm goods, and chachki with their logo) are done on the edge of the parking area under a temporary tent structure. The restrooms are also located here in a completed structure.\\n\\nThe performance venue itself is down a steep, grassy, uneven hillside from the parking area. I nearly tripped in a couple of significant holes. It had been some time since the venue was last mowed, as well. Clearly, this is not ADA-compliant in any sense, and was rather shocking that they thought this arrangement was OK, especially considering that the audience had a significant number of older members.\\n\\nThe stage is defined at its back edge by a parabolic concrete wall, meant clearly to reflect sound back toward the audience. The seating area consists of several tiers of grass with concrete walls at the back edge of each. The concrete wall behind the actors did reflect sound toward the audience, which was good, else it would have bene very hard to hear them. However, much of the performance took place off the front edge of the stage, meaning that the direct sound from the actors and the reflection off the wall were slightly out of sync with each other - rather distracting and confusing.\\n\\nThe tiered seating worked well enough, except that some people brought chairs and others sat on the grass, so that those sitting on chairs blocked the view of the grass sitters. This was problematical.\\n\\nFor some reason, a microphone on a stand was placed out in front of the stage. It was apparently connected to a single box speaker that was mounted on a tripod and placed to one side of the stage. It was never used, but did interfere with the performance. What they really needed was wireless microphones on each of the performers, with a proper sound system to bring those voices out to the audience. Such a system would likely include speakers to the sides of the stage and behind the audience.\\n\\nCuriously, staff at the venue seemed to think that what they did in the line of sight of the audience behind the stage was somehow magically invisible. One person stood with a large camera kitted out with a telephoto lens photographing the audience. (Did you ask our permission to be photographed? hmmm...) Other staff casually walked past behind the stage or, in one instance, drove a noisy vehicle past, all of which was quite distracting. What were they thinking?\\n\\nIn sum, this venue has potential, but it needs a considerable amount of work and investment in additional equipment. The staff also need to learn what it means to respect the performers whom they invite in and the audience that pays to be there.\"},{\"author\":\"Sheila Q.\",\"datePublished\":\"2018-01-18\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"The restaurant at Robin Hills Farm is finally open!

When things break down or need repair, don&apos;t expect them to come, because, they will not. Three years we have waited for windows to be replaced; they leak air horribly and every year we get told that it is on the list.  The bathroom water control, to turn the water on and off, or to take a shower broke months ago.  \\nThey insisted on a walkthrough in the midst of Covid putting our family at risk, but when I wanted to go to the office, they said that they would not let me in because of Covid.  Since then (over a month ago) they have not been back to repair a single issue.  We are still taking baths and showers with pliers (anyone that would like photo evidence of this feel free to email us).  Over three years ago when we moved in we asked them to replace the 15 year old carpet that was in disrepair, stained and honestly disgusting.  They have refused and even turned down our request to professionally clean the carpets.  All of this while still charging nearly $1600 per month.  Recently we logged online to our Sylvan Crossing account to pay our bill and saw charges in the amount of $100 for a non lease renewal fee (we have not had a lease in 2.5 years).  We were not given any notice of the increase. Just logged in and there it was. Nice business practices!\\n Or how about when our terminally ill son was home on hospice?\\n One evening we lost air conditioning in half the house, we called the emergency maintenance number and got a call back from management, where we were informed that they would address it in the morning.\\n Our son was sweating and couldn&apos;t breathe due to the heat so  I contacted a contractor friend of mine who called an HVAC friend of his and they came over and made the repairs that night.\\nManagement never called us back.\\nThe electrical wiring in the home is so bad that we doubled our renters insurance coverage due to fear of loss of property. \\nWould you like to have a very high sewage and water bill?

The weeks thereafter became increasingly uncomfortable due to my  assigned instructor, Ms. Leslie. I expressed my concerns to Ms. Margaret the Center Director. She listened and assured me she would address my concerns with the assigned tutor. Some of the actions that were exhibited towards me by my tutor were lack of interest in explaining things to me, eye rolls, arms folded and occasional raised voice. I literally felt as I was a bother. not a paying customer.  I was appalled and disappointed with these unprofessional behaviors, which was shared in great detail with the Center Director. On THREE different occasions, I was given assurances that I would no longer have to experience these behaviors from my  tutor. I signed a contract and paid in full by the specified date, however I did not get the service I expected. I was pacified, not heard and the tutor was protected. The experience at this location  failed to meet professional expectations and left me unhappy and uneasy coming to my sessions, which hindered my learning. I never knew what I would face from session to session. I was told there were no other qualified tutors to teach this particular course, leaving me at a disadvantage because I had no other resource with the Sylvan organization for tutorial learning. In addition to speaking to the Center Director, I also reached out to the Corporate office for advice, and learned that all decisions are made by each particular owner and location.

She was there from March 2017 - May 2019. She was in Ms. Lupe and Ms. Mariel&apos;s Spanish immersion preschool class. Before deciding to move out state we planned for her to be at CCDS through kindergarten. \\n\\nWe could not be happier with our experience at the school. The peace of mind we had as parents dropping her off each day and the love our daughter had for the school was priceless. The love and care her teachers provided was incredible to see. The environment at school feels like family. \\n\\nTuition includes breakfast, lunch and two snacks. You never have to stress about bringing food to school. The meal plan for lunches is unlike anything I&apos;ve ever seen. Definitely not your standard kids menu offerings. There&apos;s an on-site chef who prepares their meals each day. \\n\\nAnother awesome feature at the school is the webcams. You can log in it at anytime and watch what your child is up to from your computer or mobile device. It was especially great in the beginning when  we were leaving her with someone we didn&apos;t know for the first time. Then was just fun to sometimes peak in and see her in her school environment. \\n\\nThe last thing I will highlight is the parent/family involvement. They offer a monthly parents night out at a far less expensive rate than a babysitter and your child gets to be with their friends in a familiar environment. There&apos;s a bowling tournament for parents twice a year, a father/daughter dance, another one for mother/son and other fun events. They also have a spring and winter festival where the children perform. \\n\\nCCDS is really something special. The campus is immaculate. Everyone is so friendly/helpful, they really take pride in their work. Yes the tuition is on the higher side but it&apos;s worth every penny. You absolutely get what you pay for. A huge thank you to Ms. Melissa the director, Ms. Bailey and Ms. Nely the assistant directors. I cannot imagine all the work it takes to keep the school operating as it does... flawlessly! Ms. Lupe and Ms. Mariel, thank you for loving Miss V as your own. We will miss you both so much. Last but certainly not least Ms. Laura in the infant/toddler room.

He is our first, so it was really hard to hand him over to someone you just met. But Miss Melissa, Miss Laura and the rest of the infant teachers really made that transition for us amazingly easy! And our son LOVES it. We couldn&apos;t be happier with our choice. CCDS stood out for us for us in our daycare selection because of their curriculum. We seriously lucked out to have such great teachers as well! Miss Melissa would give me daily updates on how our son was feeling/eating/sleeping etc. and really take the time to reassure me of whatever new mom worry I had. Even in the infant area, they have structured reading/activities time which is amazing. You set the baby&apos;s feeding schedule which is really nice. \\n\\nThey helped my son transition to the toddler side at one year super smoothly and lucky for us Miss Melissa moved to the toddler side with our son (he happened to turn a year old during the transition) because he LOVES her. For a while she was the only one who could console him if something was wrong. Luckily he has opened up quite a bit! The curriculum on the toddler side is even better, jam packed with activities and outdoor play and set snack/meal times as well as a two hour nap midday. They track our son&apos;s milestones as well. They caught his first series of steps on camera for me and we get monthly updates on his progress at school. In the meantime CCDS has great perks for families as well. They host a monthly parents night out where they will watch your kids (for a fee) and they even have Moms night out (which is a great way for you to meet moms of all the other kids in your kids class!)\\n\\nThe last thing I love about CCDS is that they&apos;re really there to help the parents out and have since I am still breastfeeding my 15 month old, we even worked out an arrangement that now works for everyone! \\n\\nOur son comes home happy every day and that is a testament to the excellent care and curriculum provided by CCDS!\"},{\"author\":\"Bobbie S.\",\"datePublished\":\"2016-01-31\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":3},\"description\":\"In case anyone is wondering why so many reviews of this school all of the sudden it&apos;s because the director specifically  asked for reviews, and is tying teacher reviews to the number of mentions, see photo.

The school is run by Mrs. Manika who has taken pain staking care to ensure that the children receive an excellent education with authentic Montessori materials, while nurturing and loving them.  As mentioned, the school is run in Mrs. Manika&apos;s home.  She has converted her living and dining rooms into a traditional Montessori classroom with all high quality materials displayed on shelves placed at the children&apos;s level for easy access.  She also has a small playground area in her backyard for the children to play on, and the children eat snacks and lunch together at their child size table taking turns serving each other and practicing their manners.\\n\\nDuring the school year, Mrs. Manika hosts a winter celebration and a graduation party for families, where the children proudly perform songs and skits they have practiced, and share projects that they have made.  She also plans several field trips each year, which the children always enjoy and look forward to.  Over the years we have been to the pumpkin patch, the flower fields, the aquarium, and the Wild Animal Park to name a few. \\n\\nShalini is a caring and loving teacher who nurtures her students.  She not only guides the children to learn the normal preschool fundamentals, but also fosters compassion, acceptance, self-discipline, respect for others and self confidence in her students.  I personally find her easy to approach when I have any questions or concerns.  I also like that she holds parent-teacher conferences each year after the winter break where we can discuss in detail my son&apos;s progress, and she has even upon my request, shared suggestions to help my child grow not only in his education, but also emotionally and psychologically.  She is very tuned into each child&apos;s personality and uniqueness.  \\n\\nMy experience with Children&apos;s House Montessori spans the last 5 years and will continue for the next 4 years until my daughter completes preschool.

The entire staff knows my daughter by name even if she&apos;s never been a student in their particular classroom. The environment is fun, uplifting and genuinely shows a love for the Lord which is why we placed our daughter in a faith schooled environment in the first place. I&apos;m surprised to read a review discussing the lack of security involved because I&apos;ve always felt the school has gone above and beyond to place safety of high importance. My daughter was at school on the day we had the fires last year and the school stayed calm and organized while transporting all the children to a safer location and they communicated with each parent individually and I couldn&apos;t have felt better knowing my daughter was in good hands until we got to her. On a day to day safety issue ... they check all adults ID&apos;s when they come to pick up your child if they do not recognize that individual. Gates are locked, classrooms are looked after ... just because it&apos;s not a prison like security system by no means makes me feel like my child is ever in danger. This will be the last year my daughter attends as she moves to Kindergarten in September which they have greatly prepared her for. But with another one on the way ...

There are many teachers they have available and I took voice lessons with Jiyoung. I really loved them! As someone who&apos;s always been a terrible singer, I learned so many things during my lessons and I am a MUCH more confident singer than I am before. I&apos;m never going to be singing on Broadway, but I highly recommend lessons even if you have no intention of ever becoming a singer or even doing a live performance. Besides being really fun, I use to feel shy about singing in the car or trying to sing someone a song that I forgot the name of the song, but the lessons has given me confidence to be more expressive with my voice. I loved that Jiyoung challenged me and pushed me to improve my vocal technique. \\nSecondly, I found the CML billing platform very easy to use. They billed me via e-mail every month and it was simply a few clicks to pay and they sent a detailed invoice with every payment that was easy to save.\\nI can&apos;t speak on the other teachers, but for voice lessons Jiyoung is great. I will note though, that you can&apos;t just take lessons once a week and expect to improve much. Yes, just learning better technique can already dramatically improve your singing, but it also takes a lot of your own time and practice.

My son was eager to begin school after having his last school cut short, due to the pandemic. The director was seemingly pleasant when we met her &amp; the school had reasonable rates for what it was. My son was in the &quot;TK&quot; class.\\nWe realized soon after starting that a couple of moms in the class had it out for our son. He was a little too rambunctious for these kid&apos;s mom&apos;s and we realized later, that he was being bullied. Always labeled &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;naughty&quot; by the kids in his class &amp; he was always getting tattled on for anything he did. Naturally, my son began to act out; there were a couple of incidents that were normal playground type behavior, but we felt there was something more going on. We asked his teacher almost daily how he was doing, was anything going on, etc. and she would always say, &quot;i&apos;ll let you know if anything happens, he is totally fine. There is NOTHING to worry about. He&apos;s just being a normal 5 year old boy.&quot; Her words. Also, she let us know in a meeting we had with her later that she never uses the words &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;naughty&quot; in her classroom &amp; that those names must be coming from somewhere else (ahem, other kid&apos;s parents). Judging by my son&apos;s behavior at home, at how he used to cry at night before school, we knew there was something going on. I mean how, in a classroom of 10 kids with 2 teachers can you not realize what is happening??\\nAbout to get to the worst part about this school- THEY HAVE A 3 STRIKES POLICY FOR PRESCHOOLERS.\\nWe didn&apos;t realize this so called policy even existed until later- when we wanted to pull him out of this terrible place. There is nothing in the parent handbook, school policies, etc. It sounds like it was almost made up, so that they could push us out. We even had a sit down meeting with his teacher face to face, where she told us he was a perfectly normal 5 year old kid &amp; he&apos;s just learning- like the rest of the class. She wanted to make us feel like he wasn&apos;t a bad kid &amp; that she had his back.  She made zero mention about him having had 2 strikes at this point.\\nAlso during these incidents, my son was sent to the Director&apos;s office without notifying us first. Can the teacher&apos;s not handle the incident themselves?? That should have been a red flag.\\nIt seems that Redeemer is more worried about the opinions of overbearing &amp; non empathetic parents rather than trying to help &amp; improve the child.  There should have been some type of plan for my son, but I guess they lack the resources &amp; education on this front.\\nHad they wanted him to stay, they would have created a plan or let us in our their secret &apos;policy&apos; that he was almost at 3 strikes and that maybe we should consider looking at different schools/options we may have.\\nI only hope I can warn other parents in the area that if they have a typical 5 year old boy who is a bit active, they should probably steer clear of Redeemer.  As a Christian school, I would have thought they would have more empathy.\\nI was hopeful this school would provide the nurturing care that my son needed to grow academically, socially and emotionally. In taking the actions they have, they have failed him.\\nPartnerships between parents and teachers are imperative to a child&apos;s total growth. The communication skills to parents at Redeemer are severely lacking.\\nWe hope that maybe they will change their policy so another family doesn&apos;t have to go through what our son did &amp; crush our child&apos;s confidence &amp; well being.\\n*** As a follow up several months after pulling him from Redeemer, he is noticeably more happy, confident &amp; is now enjoying another school. His new teacher has even said this about him recently &quot;He is friends with everyone in class and has been such a great addition to our class. He is an absolute JOY to have in our class.&quot;\\nIt was clearly the wrong school for my son.

Seven days after her diagnosis, I specifically emailed the director asking that her spot be saved for her, as we were going to fight as hard as we could for her to get better, and return to her class. By the spring, I realized I hadn&apos;t heard from the school about fall enrollment, and when I emailed the director, she said our daughter&apos;s spot was taken and she could be put on a waitlist. Our then- four year old daughter had fought hard and bravely to be able to return to normal life and her class- she would have been devastated to not return to her teachers and friends- and after a lengthy email and offer to go to the local news with our story, her spot fortuitously opened up. After her treatment was done, we also heard from several parents in the school that they had tried to plan fundraisers and other events for our daughter, but all of those ideas were shot down by the director.

I chose afternoon because of the smaller class size since this was his first time in a school environment. In August when he started, the class had 8 children. After fall break, we came back to a full class of 15. This really had an effect on my son in a negative way. He no longer wanted to go to school. I think a big part of this was the noise. the class became VERY Noisy and he just didn&apos;t seem to like it.  it got to the point where it was a constant battle trying to get him in the car. He would scream and cry and kick etc. I contacted the school several times regarding this asking for advice. I spoke to his teacher a few times and the director a few times. In late February I spoke to the director again, at which point we both agreed to pull him out for the remainder of the year and try again the next fall. This was at the same time that the fall registration was due. We didn&apos;t want to lose his spot for next year but we were also struggling with what to do. We ended up submitted the $625 fee and registration a day late, which they were not pleased about.\\n\\n During his &quot;break&quot; I contacted my older sons former Preschool teacher to see if we could go and &quot;visit&quot; her school.( I would have chosen her school to begin with but we moved and she was much farther away. ) She has a very quiet preschool of 6 kids. he loved it from the minute we went to visit. She happened to have an open spot during the afternoons for the rest of the school year so we decided to enroll him through June.\\n\\nSeeing how much he enjoyed going to the new school, we decided to keep him there for next year and let Reedemer know that he would not be attending the next school year (which starts in August 2017) I then asked for our deposit back. ( $175 was the supply and registration fee and $450 was the cost of tuition for the month of June 2018. June 2018 is a full 15 months away! \\n\\nThey replied that I would not be getting any of my $625.00 back.\\n\\n I understand keeping the deposit and supply fee of $175 since we were &quot;holding his spot&quot; BUT I do not understand nor agree with them keeping the $450 tuition fee for a tuition that will occur 15 months from now.  When I brought this to their attention, they ignored my email for several weeks.\\n\\nYes, I signed a contract and i understand that. However, They made ZERO effort to work with us. Especially knowing we were having problems prior.\\n\\nIt gets better! \\n\\nToday i finally received a response. They had the nerve to state that I actually owed them March tuition of $280 AND a late fee of $25.00!. When I spoke to The director in February and she agreed that I should pull my son out, there was NO mention of owing  March tuition.  On March 7th, i was asked to send an email back stating my intentions to pull my son out for the remainder of the year for their records, with again, no mention of March tuition. I sent my intentions email on March 8th. \\n\\nHere was part of their response that I received today:\\n\\n&quot;Based on this information, the required 30 days written notice per your signed agreement ended on March 24th, therefore, the March tuition in the amount of $280 was due by March 5th.  It was not received by that date and a late fee of $25 was added for a total of $305 and as of this date, remains unpaid.&quot; \\n\\nI signed that agreement 10 months ago. it&apos;s amazing I didn&apos;t remember the part about the written notice! \\n\\nPlease note, my son did not attend a single day in March, which they were aware of in February.  \\n\\nOne more thing I wanted to add:\\n\\nIn our conversations, they thought a part of the reason for this behavior was because I was giving in to his tantrums of not wanting to go to school.  Honestly, a few times, yes. I felt bad that he screamed and cried about going. I wanted him to want to go to school. I didn&apos;t want this to be a punishment or a negative experience. They made me feel like I was not being a good mom and that he was throwing the tantrums because he knew he would get to stay home.  One day I dropped him off and he was crying and clinging to me asking to go home. The teacher just told me to walk away as she picked him up and carried him away. he was reaching for me and screaming and crying.  I felt awful about it but I walked away. \\n\\nFast forward a month of him being in the new school. ( he had about a week or two break between schools) Not ONCE has he thrown a tantrum about going to school. Not once has he kicked and screamed and begged to stay home.  This speaks volumes.  \\n\\nTheir mission appears to be aimed at making money. They are all about the fine print with no regard to our personal situation and how it may be affecting us.  I have three small children, one with medical issues,  to take care of and the last thing our family can afford is to pay money for something like this.   \\n\\nSo much for christian values and caring about families.

There have been recent changes that include a new school director. I have been compelled to withdraw my 2 girls who were in the Kindergarten program and in the 3&apos;s program. This new director is so rude and dismissive of parental concerns. It is obvious to me that she does not care much for the families at the school. This used to be a sweet, family orientated, nurturing school environment - not anymore. So sad. Miss Dee seems more like a stone faced, cold hearted prison warden than a nurturing preschool director. If you want your children to feel safe, secure and loved look elsewhere. I would imagine most of the teachers who have been there for years will soon be leaving working under this new director. They have already lost a kindergarten teacher and quite a few families have withdrawn from the school with similar complaints like ours.

And I found that in Redeemer By The Sea Preschool. Like many of you,  I toured quite a few preschools before we landed on Redeemer By The Sea Preschool. When my family needed the care, Ms. Dee the director and Ms. Rhonda were there to advise and provide what my family needed. Before enrolling, I toured the school twice. Every time I was there early, I observed that other kids seemed to enjoy being there.  My son James has been super-well-taken care of and taught by Ms. Bonnie and Ms. Nina. I just enrolled him in the Enrichment program ago since September, but so far it&apos;s been great and he learns to love art. I even sat and observe in both Enrichment classes (Art and Spanish) unexpectedly since I forgot I enrolled him in Enrichment program and I came to pick him up early. A few points I want to make. (1) For the lady who complained about the noise of the 15 children class. My son is extremely sensitive to noise. But so far he has no problem and he can&apos;t wait to go to school. Mind you, my son is in the AM class. My only guess is your son (who might have been 3 or 4 at the time) might need his nap/rest instead of going to the PM class. When kids that age get tired, they&apos;d cry and act out since they did not know how to express what they needed. (2)This school is very well-organized and the parents need to read the documents and the contracts of what we are signing. I knew I didn&apos;t and I missed out on important details. Fortunately, my overlook in the details did not cause me any monetary setback.  And I learnt from this mistake to always read carefully what paper/documents that come to my hands.  (3) Every preschool will always function as a business, regardless of if it is church affiliated since it will serve a variety of different parents and different personalities. Without written documents and rules, then chaos will definitely follow.  (4) I toured enough preschools around Carlsbad to attest that Redeemer By the Sea preschool is the best choice in this area.\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":2.5,\"reviewCount\":14}}"]},

During the testing, we found that our son&apos;s eyes weren&apos;t tracking and this was a huge issue for him. We knew we had to take action right way. Using Dr. Bloch&apos;s techniques we saw immediate improvements. He started without even being able to read the words for eyes tests and he had to read #&apos;s.  Within 2 months, he was already reading at his grade level. He was still slower than the norm but about 4 months later, he caught up and was reading at earlier 3rd grade level books. He still practices and he has learned to love to read. Any parent wants to see the best for their child. This is one thing we&apos;ve done that we can say has giving him the confidence needed to move through to the next grades. Thank you Dr. Bloch and your team, honestly couldn&apos;t have been able to do this without you!\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":5,\"reviewCount\":7}}"]},

Our son has been coming here for a couple of months now, and has been working on his interpersonal and social skills through the PEERS program, as well as continuing that training in the less formal LEGO club.\\n\\nEach program is designed to aid children who need assistance in developing and growing their social skills, and our son has been making leaps and bounds since starting here! Our son has Asperger&apos;s syndrome, and Anna has been wonderful in working with him. We did all of our homework, and her credentials all check out (which is something that we always do before working with a service provider.)\\n\\nBoth of our boys come for LEGO club, and both of them look forward to it each week, even though we get up fairly early each Saturday to get there. LEGO club proved to be an excellent starting point for the boys, and allowed them to really grow comfortable in the setting before we got the PEERS program set up for our eldest. \\n\\nNow, to the details: the facility is absolutely beautiful. Build inside a dual use location in Carlsbad, the downstairs is set up for the program. Tastefully decorated, it is fun, light, and airy, with plenty of slightly subdued colors that look delightful without being overwhelming. There are plenty of toys, and the collection of LEGO&apos;s is constantly expanding. There is a good mix of special needs and typical children, which allows for real interactions that are all supervised and directed by Anna and her staff. Everyone is incredibly friendly, welcoming, and accepting. We truly could not be happier!\\n\\nWould I recommend her to family and friends? Absolutely, and have already gone out of my way to do so. If you have a child that is struggling with social interactions, if you have a child who needs a boost, if you have a child who just doesn&apos;t quite get it, this is the place to go. We have already seen honest-to-goodness measurable improvements (which as an aside is something that is also done through the PEERS program.)\\n\\nIn summary, this program is excellent and Anna makes it all seem so easy. And, if I&apos;m honest, I&apos;ve probably picked up a pointer or two for applying in my own life as well.\"},{\"author\":\"Mooki H.\",\"datePublished\":\"2017-11-05\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"My child participated in Ana&apos;s summer camp for two summers.

Jerry was fantastic with cues and explaining dance steps to two non dancers. He even made sure to explain that our big dip at the end should be angled towards the camera and held for a few seconds to get the perfect photo. \\n\\nI was surprised by how much fun my husband had given how shy and reserved he usually is.

As another reviewer aptly points out &quot; All in all, the school is primarily focused on the French students and the French culture, and makes a poor attempt at being an International school.&quot;\\n\\nAfter relocating to Dallas from Washington State with a freshman high schooler achieving a 4.0 through Junior high, including pre=AP, we had high hopes for college prep that was promised in a private school education experience expanding her multi-lingual capabilities in an IB program.  \\n\\nI could go on an on about the horrific experience at DIS (high school IB program) , but will sum it up here in bullet points:\\n- the headmaster considers himself a &quot;CEO&quot; as in &apos;running a business&apos;.  This mindset is pervasive and reflected in the teachers he hires - few have the child&apos;s best interest at heart, they rarely make themselves available for after / during school hours access and all have second jobs or other outside priorities.\\n- the teacher turnover is virtually 100% in all subjects.  They all have second jobs or other higher priority interests.  A typical example are teachers that are there to get cost offsets for their own children.  Very few (if any) have IB training or experience.  Good luck trying to help your child navigate the syllabus, as often there isn&apos;t one because the teachers are winging it.  The headmaster seems to value teacher education levels (e.g. PhD) over and above any high school or educational teaching experience.  Just imagine your child having to deal with turnover in some of the more challenging subjects, such as 3 Economics teachers, 2 Biology teachers and 3 chemistry teachers in a three year time span.  The headmaster is bad enough, but the teachers are totally disengaged and often firing DIS and leaving, even mid year it was so bad.  And new hires (with other jobs, priorities) ended up making the children attend school from 8:30 to 5:00 pm to accommodate a teachers outside activities!\\n- No AP, SAT, ACT prep - None.  there was some feeble attempt at AP prep, but was made clear by the headmaster that this was not a priority (despite parent demands to incorporate into the curriculum).  \\n- Outside tutors required.  Because the teaching experience is so bad, you had better budget for outside tutors if you are striving for better than a C average grade for your child.  Same for AP prep, SAT and/or ACT prep.\\n\\nUnless you are a French Ex-Pat looking for a school to help educate your child for assimilation back into a Euro educational system, you are wasting your time and money and RISKING your child&apos;s future by going to this school (at least at the high school level).\\n\\nIf your child plans to attend a US college and you want them to be well prepared for college life and have the best chance of getting into the college of their choice - this is NOT the high school for your family.  If you want a private education, there are FAR better choices.  Public Schools in Plano are head and shoulders above this place.\\n\\nBottom Line: Educational Malpractice is how I would sum up DIS High School&apos;s IB Program.\"},{\"author\":\"DD S.\",\"datePublished\":\"2015-02-19\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":4},\"description\":\"We came from a sister school in Washington (FASPS), and as much as we liked that school, we like DIS better.

The French system is much more challenging, in terms of content and in terms of intellectual rigor, than the American system. \\n\\nSo if you have an academically challenged child,  or a child who really isn&apos;t interested much in learning, then this is definitely not the school for you.  \\n\\nIf you have a child who struggled to learn English as a first language, then this school is definitely not for you.  Children take not only French, but Spanish, and at 6th grade can take Mandarin Chinese.  So from age 3, all children are working in 3 languages.\\n\\nIt is not true, as stated another review, that the focus is primarily on French.  In the early grades,the school is 40% English, 40% French and about 20% Spanish.  The ratio slowly switches as children get older, such that there is majority French instruction by Middle School, but there is still a substantial amount of English (it&apos;s probably 60 to 65%  instruction in French by the Middle School level).  BUT this just means the content is taught in French; it doesn&apos;t mean they are learning French all of that time  (they are already pretty fluent by then).  They are doing math, biology, physics, computer science, history,  geography, etc. and they do many of these subjects in both English and French.\\n\\nI have two children at the school, one in Middle and one in Elementary school, and both started at age 3.  I have never hired tutors, and there is alot of homework starting in about 3rd grade.  There is homework help at the school for French, for those children who don&apos;t have anyone at home who speaks French. \\n\\nMost DIS kids are fairly fluent by the 4th grade or so, so they don&apos;t necessarily need help with language beyond that point.\\n\\nThere are teachers at the school who tutor if you need it (I think it&apos;s sort of reasonable to expect that if a child is learning a language and no one at home speaks it,you might need some outside help now and then).\\n\\nMy experience with the French teachers has also been nothing but positive.  The French teachers are excellent.  They are recruited from among teachers in France, where teaching is a competitive profession, where it&apos;s actually rather difficult to become a teacher, and where teacher training is much more extensive than in the US.\\n\\nI know some people sometimes perceive that the English instruction is sometimes not as strong as the French instruction, but what can I say, the American system academically just isn&apos;t as strong, so when you have the two side by side, it shows.\\n\\nDoes that mean the English teachers are not good?  No, it means the French educational system is stronger than the American one, and that, it seems to me, is an argument for putting your child in this school.\\n\\nMy children have excelled at the school. My son scores above the 95th percentile on American standardized tests.\\n\\nI know other parents of children who started at age 3 and went up through MIddle or High school who have the same experience.  I also know that  one of the DIS graduating Seniors last year got a President&apos;s Scholarship at SMU this year, and that is the most prestigious scholarship the school gives.   Given that it was a small graduating class, that is quite impressive.\\n\\nOther DIS graduates have gone on to other universities and earned the equivalent of a year of credit based on their IB scores; in many cases, they have gone right into upper-level courses, and this is especially true in languages.  Some children have gone to universities in Canada, where tuition is much lower than in the US, and where DIS students are more competitive than most American students.\\n\\nAs I said, this is clearly a school for academically-oriented children and families.  If you want your child to go to college on an athletic scholarship, you probably ought to look elsewhere, but if you want a child who comes out at 12th grade with a better education than most college-educated Americans have, this is probably the place for you.\"},{\"author\":\"Scott N.\",\"datePublished\":\"2015-06-12\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"I happened upon the below review by accident and felt compelled to respond.  Let me start by saying that my son has been attending DIS for two years.  He is now in first grade.  The below reviewer neglects to mention whether her review is based on a personal experience with the school or based upon feedback she has heard from others.  My review is based on my first-hand observations..  \\n\\nAt the outset, the assertion that communication is &quot;non-existent&quot; is untrue.  I have a daughter at Parish Episcopal, and I can say without reservation, that DIS does a better job of keeping me informed.  I receive multiple communications DAILY from staff and teachers at DIS.  Teachers will regularly update us on daily classroom activities, which sometimes include pictures of the children performing the activities being described.  Frankly, I love being at my computer at work and receiving a picture of what my child is doing at that very moment.  I&apos;ve never had a school do that before.  The assertion that communication is &quot;non-existent&quot; is simply false.  \\n\\nThe comment that there is &quot;some anti-American sentiment&quot; is equally untrue.  I am a gun toting, conservative Texan and a staunch supporter of our American military, and I assure you that if I EVER sensed any anti-American sentiment, I would whip my boy out of that school so fast that it would make your head spin.  I love this country, and I would never tolerate anything &quot;anti-American&quot; and surely would never voluntarily expose my boy to it.  \\n\\nThe reviewer further asserts that &quot;there are issues concerning the education of the non-French speakers&quot;.  I don&apos;t know what she means, but I don&apos;t speak French, and my boy didn&apos;t speak French before attending.  He is doing great, and his studies are on par with his similarly aged cousins, except that my boy is fluent in French.  And the school does offer a summer introductory course.  \\n\\nThe &quot;social issues&quot; analysis is ridiculous and shameful.  DIS has a zero tolerance rule regarding physical contact.  They are actually very strict.  The fact is that these children are very closely monitored and loved.  Today was my son&apos;s last day of school for the year, and the teachers and assistants were very emotional - some were weeping.  My boy actually says that he &quot;loves&quot; his teacher and her assistant.  I cannot recount the number of occasions that my boy was ill or was struggling with something, only to be comforted by a school staff member or teacher.  My wife and I regularly express to each other how fortunate we were to have him surrounded by people that love him.  The assertion that the teachers don&apos;t &quot;nurture&quot; is categorically, unequivocally false, and it saddens me that someone would characterize them in that manner.  These are simply wonderful people that love what they do.\\n\\nAs for the school&apos;s responsiveness, once again, I cannot give them higher praise.  The school and staff are extremely responsive. \\n\\nAs for the curriculum, my boy is only in first grade, so I don&apos;t have first-hand experience, but I do know that SMU awarded the President&apos;s Scholarship to a recent graduate of DIS.  Here is how SMU describes the recipient of this award:\\n\\n&quot;The President&apos;s Scholars Program is awarded to students who have shown exemplary academic and leadership skills. The award provides full tuition and fees as well as study abroad. Students who live on campus also receive a scholarship for room and board. For consideration for the President&apos;s Scholarships, the highest academic awards given by the University, students must have exceptional achievement on the SAT or ACT and in their high school curriculum.&quot;\\n\\nThe President&apos;s Scholarship is awarded to only 20-25 freshmen.  So, not only did this DIS graduate gain admission to SMU, but he also had what it took to procure a scholarship that was awarded to only 22 of its entering freshmen.  \\n\\nSuffice to say, I am 100% satisfied with from I have experienced with this school so far.  The high school students I have met seem incredibly well adjusted and talented.  It is simply a wonderful academic institution.\"},{\"author\":\"A.

Though the lower school was okay, the upper level teachers are abusive and have no compassion for their students or the subjects they teach. The school does have issues with physical abuse. Slapping, kicking, and punching are regular on the playground. Most of the teachers are washed up french teachers who could not get better jobs with their foreign degrees. Therefore, they seem to harbor ill feelings toward the school and with it, the students. The administration turns a blind eye to abuse from the teachers. A teacher who continuously verbally and physically abused enjoyed employment at D.I.S for over ten years despite parental complaints. Instead of firing the teacher, parents were pressured to move their students elsewhere ( Three during my time at the school).   \\n\\nAs for the psychological effects on the students, most of my peers who stayed ended up socially awkward. I currently work with some current students from D.I.S. At even their young ages, I can see the crippling effects of the school. \\n\\nAcademically,The French-centric nature of the school can cause problems in later years. Students leave D.I.S with limited, if any, knowledge of American History or tradition. I strongly suggest a traditional private or public school. If the bi-lingual track is a must for your child, consider sending them for their formative language years. No child should stay at the school past 3rd grade.

We&apos;ve been overjoyed with the education they&apos;re receiving and with the friends from all over the world that all of us have made through the school.

We&apos;ve actually been inspired to get Rosetta Stone for French as a Christmas gift for each other so we can keep up with them as they start to speak (and perhaps conspire) with each other more and more in a foreign language. Everyone at the school has taken a genuine personal interest in our children&apos;s development. Amazingly, one of the teaching assistants who moved to California when her husband transferred jobs still emails us regularly to check on our younger son&apos;s progress since he had a bit of a challenge starting school so young (at 3 years and 2 months). Thanks to her help and the attention of his teachers and other teaching assistants, not to mention all the friends he&apos;s made, he now looks forward to school and it&apos;s sometimes difficult to extract him at the end of the day.\\n\\nSince my wife and I both work full-time, we were especially gratified that DIS offers excellent after school care until 6 pm, with great activities for the kids. Our boys have been exposed to karate, yoga, circus (taught by ex-Cirque de Soleil performers!), gymnastics, soccer, and drama, with the opportunities only continuing to expand as they get older. And, for what we would argue is a much more interesting education, the price at DIS is still significantly less than most other Dallas private schools. If you&apos;re looking for a school with a great football team and lots of Bentleys in carpool line, this is not the place for you. If you want your children to be in a challenging yet nurturing environment that prepares them to value and understand the world outside of the provincial Dallas establishment, DIS is a great choice.\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":4,\"reviewCount\":13}}"]},

I didn&apos;t realize how good Clifton School was for my son until I moved to another state.  Clifton School is truly a one-of-a-kind experience.\\nThings I loved:\\n1)Smaller class sizes- My son was first in one of the infant classrooms and then transitioned to a toddler classroom.  There were about 8 kids per one AM or PM teacher and an additional assistant.\\n2)Reggio Emilia approach to teaching- You can check out a better definition on Wikipedia.  \\n-Basically, the approach believes in discovery learning through exploration and creativity.  Each child is allowed his or her own learning style.  Group learning is important too (my son at 20 months could say the names of his classmates).  There is a curriculum coordinator who goes classroom to classroom to see how the kids are learning.  At a point in the year, the coordinator/team calls you to let you know how your child is doing.  Also, there are sit down meetings with teachers.\\n-It&apos;s actually much bigger than just a way of learning.  The approach also believes in an open curriculum so that teachers can change plans based on children learning.  \\n-The physical environment is important too.  Reggio schools have open areas with piazzas.  Kids aren&apos;t just shuttled between a small classroom and an outdoor playground.  The infant classrooms, for example, are clustered together into a &quot;village&quot; with an open indoor gross motor play area called a piazza.  Each village has an outdoor play area as well.  This is very unique.  I&apos;ve toured multiple daycares in Kentucky and most are not this open with natural lighting.  You might not think this is important but if you were in a small classroom day in an day out you would start feeling cramped too.\\n-The approach believes in parent involvement.  Clifton School has a PTA that meets on a regular basis and generates money through fundraising.  Each class has at least one class rep.  Parents for each classroom are put on an email list, so concerns can be addressed.  There are multiple ways in which you can submit concerns from the classroom to the administrative level.  This is unique too.  Again, multiple daycares in Georgia and Kentucky DO NOT allow this level of parent involvement (eg kindercare, primrose, clarian place).\\n3)Great use of resources\\n-Each classroom has a digital camera.  The teachers take pictures of the kids during the day and write a small one slide powerpoint that goes out to the parents&apos; email list.  You really feel connected to what the kids are doing that day.  It gave me a smile at the end of my day to see an email with a picture of my son playing a drum.  I used to send the email attachments to grandparents to let them know how my little one was doing.\\n-The Clairmont Campus now has access to fresh fruits and vegetables from a local farm.  Parents place orders and pick up their produce at the Clairmont location.  This is a great sustainable living initiative.\\n-They hire real photographers from the community to come take pictures of kids for class picture day.  They have a music teacher who sits down with individual classes.  My son got to see someone play a harpsichord when he was 18 months old.\\n4)Great teachers- great education backgrounds and they love the kids.  When my son was about to move, tears were shed by teachers and administration.  I really felt like I lost a second family.\\n\\nWhat I didn&apos;t like:\\n1)It&apos;s been mentioned on Google Reviews that the administration isn&apos;t responsive to parent concerns.  I did have an issue with the closure-due-to weather policy and didn&apos;t get feedback.  I&apos;m not a pushy parent and ended up not caring.  The truth is that there are multiple ways to communicate with the administration, unlike other day cares.  If I were pushy enough, I could&apos;ve brought it up at a PTA meeting.  I remember the parents got upset that the teachers were only sending out daily word ppts instead of ppts with pictures, and someone posted a complaint to the parent email listserv.  The problem was resolved that week.  \\n2)Clifton School is only open to Emory and CDC employees.  I&apos;m not entirely sure of all the reasons for this but it&apos;s really not fair to keep this great school confined to a small group of people.  Clifton School will now be receiving a Georgia lottery funded pre-K and enrollment has to be open to the community.  Maybe this will change their opinions.  \\n3)The price!  This school is expensive and I&apos;d like to believe it&apos;s worth it.  The school grounds, technologies, and equipment are really kept up nicely.  Parents of infants have Similac available as an optional part of the program.  We cut down on formula costs after the switch to Similac.\\n4)Long wait list- I applied in late Summer of 2012, delivered Sept 2012, and my son didn&apos;t come off the wait list until May 2013. \\n\\nBoy, I could write more but it looks like Yelp won&apos;t allow it.  I hope this gives a little more info than the angry reviews out there.\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":5,\"reviewCount\":1}}"]},

They sincerely practice what they preach. My son has ADHD, and the teachers were exceptional in identifying his needs, using targeted strategies to assist him, and communicating with me about ways to support him. Despite his challenges, they never lost sight of his unique strengths. Now that he is in first grade, he is thriving. And, the beauty of it is, because it&apos;s a small school, his current teachers already have some familiarity with him and have been able to give me great feedback about his improvement. \\n\\nThe focus on ensuring that kids are well-rounded citizens is also a real asset for FSA. My son is courteous, kind, and socially aware. He talks about helping the homeless, eating healthy foods, and caring for the environment. He gets adequate exercise and sunlight during the school day (which research shows is linked to greater energy and concentration). He is learning conflict management skills, mindfulness, empathy, and how to be a good member of a team. As someone who works with business leaders, I know that these lessons will be invaluable in his life. I once told the headmaster that he radiates warmth. His demeanor is so kind, upbeat, and positive - he never looks like he&apos;s going through the motions. I believe that he sets a great tone for the rest of the school.

The teachers are very good and I believe her level of learning and exploring out paces her previous local day care center.  I&apos;m writing this review to point out a few items for prospective parents to consider before selecting TSS.  Food is not included with tuition, so packing lunches is a requirement.  They&apos;re strict about no peanuts, so no PB&amp;J&apos;s at this school.  They&apos;re also fairly particular about monitoring how you prepare the food (slicing round things to avoid choking hazards, etc) and making sure it&apos;s nutritionally balanced.  We received some &quot;coaching and counseling&quot; (soft approach) on this topic.  Also, the hours for &quot;full time&quot; are 830am-330pm.  For working parents this can be tough since it does not coincide with conventional work hours.  There&apos;s no extended care option (currently) at the EL campus.  If you&apos;re a stay-at-home parent looking for some time to yourself, then this may work.  Also, you pay tuition for the month.  (Full disclosure, their calendar is published.)  We had wished we&apos;d reviewed it more closely.  We feel we pay a lot in tuition while they seemed to be closed quite a bit or pop the random 130pm pick up for staff meeting.  I don&apos;t understand why they can&apos;t schedule their staff meetings after 330pm to avoid additional inconvenience to those paying for &quot;full time&quot; care.  As working parents we&apos;re often scrambling for supplemental care or taking lots of time off work to accommodate.  They don&apos;t pro-rate the tuition to reflect all the time they require early pick up or all the closed time they incorporate into the schedule.   The EL campus follows Decatur school&apos;s calendar, even though many of our older kids are on the APS schedule (Drew).  We have found ourselves with 1 child off for a break (spring/winter etc) 1 week and the TSS child off the next.  We&apos;re paying lots of $$$$ for camps, sitters etc to cover childcare while we work.  Also, they spend a lot of time outside in a muddy, dirt (not much mulch) play area...so we&apos;ve thrown away lots of trashed kids clothes.  In summary, when they  ARE open....the learning opportunities and staff are good.  This is not the place to send your kid if you work full-time or have other kids in the APS school schedule.  It&apos;s roughtly twice as much per month as our old pre-school, provides no food, opens 2 hours later than our and closes 2.5 hours earlier than our other center, and is probably closed/closes early an average of 4 days per month more.

If you pick up late, there is a $1 fee per minute. That is fine by me. So sometimes I was late and happily paid the fee. Then I got an odd phone call about it, reminding me of the fee. So i responded that I knew about the fee and was happy to pay it. (i am very direct). But I asked, are you hinting that i should not be late? Is it a problem? (I don&apos;t speak in code). The person said it was fine to be late as long as I paid. Later I found out from my child, he was being separated out from the &quot;staff kids&quot; and made to stay indoors with the teachers. While this first explained to me as a staffing issue, my kid was completely incorporating this into his self-image, and moping around saying he wasn&apos;t a staff kid, if he couldn&apos;t complete a challenging task. When I asked again about this, another staff person told me this was a deterrent. Not a punishment, but a deterrent. Look these words up, a deterrent IS a punishment, they were trying to deter ME from being late, by punishing my kid, instead of just telling me straight out! The administrator who told me this was aggressive in her body language and her tone, to the point where i actually sat down, to make myself small and relaxed to defuse what was becoming an ugly situation. This is unacceptable and has never happened to me in the business world.  Then to make things extra fun, they called my *EX husband to ask him for MY credit card number within minutes to get my payment for pulling my kid out. I believe that is illegal, let alone unethical. This place has an amazing philosophy, but some of its administrators are willing to let children be hurt, and are willing to raise their voices, over simple policy matters they could just be straight about.

You get to participate in a smattering of circus acts, which is cool-- but none of them are exceptionally unique or fun. For example-- you get to walk on a wire that&apos;s a foot or so off the ground. You juggle some scarves. You climb a rope. You do some basic gymnastics on a static trapeze that&apos;s just barely high enough that you don&apos;t hit your head when you hang from your knees. Cool-- but I didn&apos;t feel very circus-y, frankly. Also, I see this class listed as an awesome &quot;alternative workout&quot; in various places, and it&apos;s really not much of a workout, unless you are very very out of shape.\\n\\nI will say that the owner, Carrie, is very kind and clearly passionate about her studio. The place is charming and home-y, and the cats that roam around are delightful. That said, I was never really sure who was teaching the class?

While I was there, the instructor ran across his room to answer his cell phone; BUT, I&apos;ll hand it to Carrie, she was ON THAT and clearly unhappy with him.

If you thought a trapeze looked easy... think again. The amount of upper body strength required for that is insane! Amazing, amazing work out, though, and fantastic instructors to boot.\\n\\nYour first class is all about teaching you the ropes: literally. Rope climbing, trapeze, tightrope walking, juggling, and balance board or a special little class like I was treated to last night. Most of the activities require a lot of core and upper body strength, though you&apos;ll be using every part of your body. Juggling wasn&apos;t too difficult as you&apos;re using fabric... and it&apos;s certainly easier when you don&apos;t have a physics teacher grading you for how many reps you can do (true story).\\n\\nBest part of class was the special session our group had. One guy, Steve, was more than happy to show us acrobatic basics. Imagine me, a little five foot thing, being able to lift up my 6 foot 3 inch boyfriend off the ground with my legs. No, really! Steve taught us how to do that as well as a few other basic moves, and within a few minutes I was not only lifting my boyfriend, but he had someone stand up on my boyfriend so now I&apos;ve got two people relying on me 100%. Amazing feeling to be able to do that!\\n\\nThis is so fun! Even if you only come once, it&apos;s certainly a positive experience to have. Everyone here from student to instructor is encouraging and helpful, always ready to show you something new you never thought you&apos;d ever be able to do.

Before going here, bear in mind that this is not an aerial yoga class nor is it a circus-inspired cardio workout. You will execute actual circus moves and techniques, with particular care paid to your safety and the safety of those around you. I know someone who was disappointed in the structure of the class because they wanted to jump right in and start flying, but that just cannot happen in all practicality.\\n\\nWhen you take the intro class, you will be assigned to a group and you will rotate between various stations. One is the Spanish web (which most people would probably describe as rope climbing), another is the stationary trapeze (no flying here), then there&apos;s the tight rope and juggling, and finally human pyramid building. At each station, everyone in the group gets to try the routine there, and you can repeat it if there&apos;s enough time. I&apos;ve been to two classes and at the end of one of them, the instructors did demos on the high trapeze and the Spanish web - very cool.\\n\\nEven though this is not an aerobic workout, it is definitely a strength and balance workout and will likely work some muscles you haven&apos;t used for a while. It&apos;s also really fun to do things I don&apos;t normally do in my workouts.\\n\\nThe instructors are really nice and they keep track of whether you&apos;ve been there before so you can start with something more advanced the next time you go.

Circus Arts Institute was the complete opposite of that. The room itself is small and dark with only one trapeze and one Spanish web. The class said it had room for 20+ students, but felt cramped with just 7 of us. The instructor was a complete waste. He was cocky, a show-off, and unprofessional. He made myself and my girl friends feel very uncomfortable, kept complaining about how hungry and tired he was (I am a full-time student and work full-time, you don&apos;t have to tell me twice what tired is like), and spent more time showing off his own skills than actually helping us as students to improve our own. We each got one chance to climb and one chance to do a series on trapeze. In an hour and a half class we spent at least 50 minutes stretching (yes stretching is necessary, but this was just ridiculous), 2 minutes on trapeze, 2 minutes on Spanish web, and the rest of the class throwing around scarves and calling it &quot;juggling&quot;.

She made herself available to the students and did a lot of one-on-one work.\\n\\nAlthough we all made the same project (a ring), Wendy made sure there were many opportunities to customize it. You determine the band size of your ring, decide to have a patterned or smooth band, whether or not to have a stone set in the ring, and the color and shape of the stone. I left Amalgam with a beautiful handmade and custom ring! \\n\\nThe 10am class went until 2pm with many opportunities for snacks and bathroom breaks in between. The way the class works is Wendy explains each step as you go along and floats around the room to help people complete that step. For the complicated steps (i.e. Soldering), Wendy works with students one by one to ensure safety and correctness. When you&apos;re waiting for your turn or letting your ring sit in the &quot;pickling solution&quot; as Wendy calls it, you can relax and do whatever. I snacked (bring food or buy it at the cafe right outside), socialized, and studied for an upcoming exam I had; so, bring things to do or not - just a heads up. \\n\\nRemember to wear close toed shoes, and be ready for an easy, relaxing Saturday at Amalgam if you take the 4 hour workshop, which I highly recommend. It&apos;s a fabulous activity for mom/dad and daughter/son dates, a girl/guy&apos;s day, or plain ol&apos; self care. \\n\\nLocation and parking: The studio is situated in a grouping of buildings that kind of look like bungalows.

Her teaching style is very hands on, which is great. But she&apos;s anti-note taking, which didn&apos;t work well for me. Basically she explains the next 8 or so steps (which include using a torch and a saw) and then whenever you forget what&apos;s next, you&apos;re supposed to ask her for the next step. I (and the other students) spent half the time waiting in line to ask what&apos;s next. If I just guessed and moved on because it was taking too long, she inevitably let me know I had messed up. She saw I was being really careful with the torch and started getting impatient, just doing the torch work for me when I had asked for help doing it. Wendy has a very strong personality which you will might love, but I found a little grating after a while. I ran out of time to finish my project and asked if I could pay to come finish it at open shop hours (which she had previously said we were welcome to) but then she told me that was only for more advanced students and I should really just sign up for the next 8 week class (I really just needed an hour or two to finish a couple things). I really wish I had just take notes anyway, and had chosen a different instructor whose style and personality matched mine better.

We emailed the principal about the situation and she straight-up lied to us, even though she wasn&apos;t present for the incident. She told us she knew for certain that our son brought that snack to school worker and told her she could throw it away. When asked for video footage from the cafeteria during the time of incident the school superintendent emailed us directly with snark that they &quot;don&apos;t eat in a &apos;cafeteria&apos; because of COVID mitigation.&quot; Which was not remotely the answer we were looking for. To paraphrase: &quot;Hey did your employee put their hand on our child in the cafeteria?&quot;  &quot;Well...

Inquiry is taken as immediate attack on the establishment. Read further for experience.  \\n\\nFor the first two weeks of school at Maria&apos;s Montessori, pick-ups and drop-offs were alarmingly abrupt. The door is opened long enough for kids to enter, then closed again. So with no view into the school, these were the things I did witness:  full lunches returned every day (except one day when his homemade empanadas went missing, even though he said he&apos;d only taken one bite. I will let the reader consider what happened there). My son would say he drank no water, no &quot;work&quot; done (Montessori language), movies, marshmallows for snack, crying and describing kids punching each other, no books read, teachers hitting kids on the head.  Any concern I had about academics went out the window in comparison to my son&apos;s physical well-being.  \\n\\nMy son had never had issues before this school. But, understanding that every story has two sides, I gave some benefit of the doubt and reminded my son and the door contact each day that he needed to eat and drink water. Thursday and Friday of that first week, stomach pain started. My husband and I decided that without any way to see into the school or avenue to ask questions, it was time to follow her procedure for communication and schedule a conference to see if Maria (owner) could shed light on our son&apos;s reports. We could also offer them some Montessori-based solutions that his prior school and I used to get him to eat and drink, plus seek some system of transparency.  \\n\\nWe emailed Monday of the second week requesting a conference with a suggested time - no details about our specific concerns. After a followup email to Maria Wednesday evening asking if I could expect a call at the suggested time, the response I got at 6am Thursday morning was alarming. Maria stated that I was expecting immediate results in my son&apos;s academics, that I should choose another preschool, and that I could come collect my son&apos;s things that day.  Review: I had not spoken with Maria about any of my concerns, seeing as her handbook clearly states that issues require a scheduled conference. In my attempt to follow policy, her response was to kick my son out.  \\n\\nMy husband said we needed to go see her immediately. When we pulled up to the school Thursday morning, I tried to establish a shared purpose (we both want a contract), explain my intentions for a solution, and ask if the email she sent was a formal cancellation of the contract. However, she immediately launched into how her history as a business woman, and that I was not going to question her establishment. Not once did she seek to hear what my son was struggling with, her concerns were in no way child-centered, and always included how much she is having to work. When my husband came up and tried to mention that it was physical nutrition, she LAUGHED! and said they don&apos;t &quot;force feed children&quot;. Maria kept repeating that our relationship was not going to work. On the third time, I realized she was right.  In seeking a partnership around how to best serve a child to understand how my child is being treated within the school, we were told that we had no place there. She also accused me of not bringing up the issue at pickup and dropoff, when I was trying to respect HER clear guidelines.  \\n\\nMy son is now in a different daycare, and the transparency there is like night and day from Maria&apos;s. We met his teacher, we get to meet classmates, we get a letter each day with concrete evidence of what our son worked on. Maria&apos;s Montessori is not a safe environment for children if those children are not allowed to voice how they are being harmed. If anything, the incredible defense in response to any attempt at questioning Maria should serve as an immediate warning to any parent considering the school - tell-tale sign that transparency is her enemy.\"},{\"author\":\"ML G.\",\"datePublished\":\"2016-02-23\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"I love Maria&apos;s Montessori School!

Wings of Water is straight forward in their mission - it&apos;s a swim school. Some parents told us they move at a snails pace and that was also our experience. That&apos;s likely part of the business model. \\n\\nAfter signing up for classes nothing here is straightforward and I don&apos;t really know how they run the business, because you have to continually do the leg work. Whomever owns this place isn&apos;t involved in how it&apos;s being managed. We initially had one teacher and then after one class were told that she was double booked, so we&apos;d have to be flexible and get another teacher instead. Fine. Our regular teacher was engaging and I wouldn&apos;t give her 1. \\n\\nOver the course of several months there were so many cancellations and the subs ran the gamut from somewhat involved to preoccupied. \\nWhat I really don&apos;t like about Wings Over Water is the way they treat clients. At Summer&apos;s end, we had the last lesson of the month and the instructor then told us she was no longer offering private classes, so we&apos;d have to get that sorted. There&apos;s no continuity. \\n\\nWhen we inquired at the office the woman rolled her eyes, stressed they be on a break for several weeks, and she could add us to the wait list. The utter lack of communication and care for informing people is just shoddy business. Every interaction with the front desk felt frazzled. \\n\\nI&apos;m happy to invest in my children learn skills, especially swimming, but after a complete $1200 Summer program my children are more content in the water and eager to learn, but not full swimmers. I&apos;d look elsewhere and now understand the discontentment of other parents. \\n\\nAlso, there was no enforcing of the current city issued mask mandate, despite hanging signage.

If your lucky to get a slow day or a time the pool is dead that&apos;s when your kid can get attention without chaos.

We love Melissa/Edie, the owner of the place and the teachers we have had, except for one and he has left.  One of my girls developed a sudden fear of jumping in after she&apos;s been there for a session and had been doing so with no issue.  Melissa not only guided her out of that phase, she did so gently, though firm with her request without making my daughter feel afraid or bad.  For weeks, Melissa thought out of box and came up with really creative solutions for my daughter to try until they figured out something that worked and after that within a lesson or two, my daughter was back to water loving self.\\n\\nPositives:\\n* facility - awesome heated pool in a warm room so kids don&apos;t get cold coming out of the water; separate viewing room at a comfortable temp\\n* cleanliness - I know they are strict with their swim pants request, but the facility is spotless and their strictness with the policy makes me feel comfortable knowing my kids may swallow some water\\n* awesome instructors and really amazing teaching methodologies\\n\\nI completely disagree that they keep your kids in a level longer than necessary just to make money.  I know that it&apos;s hard to see your kids in the same level a few times when you think they can swim really well.  But they really evaluate your children accurately based on their techniques and needs.  Just because your kids can &quot;swim&quot; around, it does not mean that they are doing it with the techniques that WOW is looking for in the next level.  Why does this matter?  Well, in the next level, they would be looking to build on that technique, if your kid doesn&apos;t have it down, it would slow down the whole class while the instructor works with him/her on it.\\n\\nCons:\\n* definitely VERY expensive, but not more than penguin and some other high end swim schools that don&apos;t even have their own facility\\n* some of the front desk staffs.  While we love the original front desk staff, the new ones have not been of equal quality and some are down right rude or incompetent.

The front desk was very encouraging and attentive to my needs. Even though I live in Stamford, they suggested I enroll right away (but my class was a peak-traffic time--that&apos;s a whole other story).\\n\\nI was suggested to enroll in the adult beginner class. I believe this was the wrong call completely. Even though the class size was small, each adult was on different levels. One student had already begun lessons a semester or two prior, one was an elderly woman who had much more experience with water than I clearly did, and one other adult, who was late to register had picked up on what I was having trouble with for a week on her first day. Needlesstosay, this really affected my self-esteem.\\n\\nThe instructor was not personal, and was not able to give me the attention I needed during class. Our interaction was simply, awkward and uncomfortable, and I do not think he took the time to establish a sense of understanding between him and I, and for something I felt completely skeptical and unsure of, that is, the water. I already didn&apos;t trust the water, or find my own strength, and he never allowed me to trust him either.\\n\\nEarly on, I considered switching to private lessons, and wondered if one-on-one would be better for me. Upon multiple attempts to bring up my concerns either by speaking to someone at the front desk (before or after class), making phone calls or filling out request forms, my needs had not been met. Ultimately, I ended up spending extra money on a private lesson in addition to the class. \\n\\nAfter feeling as though my performance was not sufficient for the school, and that my needs were not important enough to be met, I decided to simply quit, and not show up. There was no follow-up from the school, so I ended up calling, finally, to inform them that I did not want to be a part of the class. I did not even mention a refund, since that is against their policy. \\n\\nI believe there were many things I learned as a young adult in the real-world of service. I was a customer--a nervous, uncertain and confused one at that--but one who paid in full--and A LOT of money, to have the opportunity to be supported in something that is one of my greatest challenges and fears. W.o.W sort of...ruined the idea to ever learn how to swim and did not give me any attention. I felt terribly alone and unsupported. I did not feel as I was part of a team that encouraged me. I understand they were busy, and primarily serve their younger learners; I also understand I was discouraged and insecure. But for adult swimmers, be sure you know what your needs are, and be smart on where you choose to go.\"},{\"author\":\"Melissa S.\",\"datePublished\":\"2014-11-24\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"My daughter has been at WOW since she was 2 years old. Their method of teaching is really one of a kind. It&apos;s not the same old routine you find at your local pool. They teach swim safety before your child is even learning strokes etc. Because, really that is what every parents wants don&apos;t they? ...for their child to be SAFE in the water? \\nCase and point 2 summers ago my daughter was 3 years old. We were at a friend&apos;s pool and she was playing on a floating mat. She wasn&apos;t a STRONG swimmer but Melissa taught her how to be SAFE in the pool. As she was floating and playing with her cousin, I knew in the back of my mind that she as going to fall in and I was ok with it. I actually wanted her to fall in because I want to see if she could react properly while I was safely watching. Within minutes she flipped over and was in water over her head. Now it&apos;s one thing to see your child do the safety drills in class but, it&apos;s another to watch it in action with no instruction. She fell off and did EXACTLY what she was taught and swam to a safe place and held on until I could pull her out. She has been taught safety in the water which to me in invaluable. The comments about the staff being rude are simply not true. Melissa and her staff are firm yes. But, this to me is imperative in swim instruction. Children need to know while swimming is fun we have to always be safe and listen to instruction. I couldn&apos;t imagine having her being taught anywhere else. My now 16 month old is enrolled and loving the water. The owner Melissa is incredibly passionate about swimming and she is just amazing with the little ones.

She was in charge of running the party but I&apos;m pretty sure she doesn&apos;t like kids.  She didn&apos;t smile once, acted like everyone there was in her way, and rudely shushed the children when they were chanting in excitement over cake.  Is this a library or an art studio that hosts child&apos;s bday parties?!  I watched her be rude and unfriendly to outside customers picking up their pottery as well.  After reading another review it seems the owners really need to be more careful with who they hire.  If I were the paying mom of the party I would&apos;ve been furious that that&apos;s who I got.  Try being a little pleasant if you&apos;re going to take a job that interacts with kids.  The second girl working may have been a nice girl but I can&apos;t say for sure, she stood silently waiting for something to do most of the time.

When we arrived it was very confusing, not much in the way of direction from anyone that worked there. They were having a birthday party in the back and clearly that was the priority. We wandered around with the rest of the clueless parents for someone to actually explain to us the way things work. After picking out the pottery we then went up to pick out paint colors, which was also very disorganized.  There was no explanation of what was available to us, we had to wander around and find stencils and stamps only after seeing other people using them. All of the brushes have seen their day, and there were no new ones to be found. And then after cashing out we find out that not only do you pay for each pottery piece but there is an additional &quot;studio fee&quot; of  $8 per person per hour, for a total of over $100.00.

In my forties I thought it was too late to go back, I was so wrong, and glad that I did.  Online schooling is a challenge as one needs to think outside the box and sometimes be a mind reader of what their professors might be looking for.  I recieved both my BS and MBA at Columbia Southern University and learned confidence in areas and schools of thought that I did not have before.  The courses will challenge you and the college is at a great price.  And before any of you go running away at the challenge, remember that the challenge is what you learn from and need to overcome.  In many of the programs you will learn more than your education, and will find a staff that has your success in mind.  The extra things I learned were patience, professionalism, and the courage to seek clarity like a pro and within academic policies and chains of command.  They are flexible and even had life flexible terms that you can choose from.  Although only a nationally accredited institution and a member of the Distance Education and Training Council, they are as of 2022 under review for being regionally accredited. \\n They also have an alumni association that students can be recommended to.

I have to disagree with the person who said that this college is as easy as or easier than high school. Yes, most of the work you submit is essays; however, that is the challenging part.  The coursework is very rigorous. I have attended both a b&amp;m college as well as CSU, so I can attest that this college is definitely harder. You can&apos;t plagiarize essays because they use Turn It In for many of the classes and major points are deducted if the redundancy rate is too high. I have had this happen, even when none of my material was plagiarized. So, I had to learn to use more of my own words and and not quote so much material. If you can easily write essays, you might consider this university easy. However, if you struggle with writing and thoughts don&apos;t come as easily to you, like me, then you might have a different view of this school. In one class alone, I had to write 18 essays. It would be much easier to have multiple choice, like I did in high school or like I did when I went to my b&amp;m college.  However, I will say that I have retained more information through my coursework at CSU than I have at any other school. I retain more information when I have to write than when I have to just memorize information for a short term. There is no extra credit or making up assignments. If you don&apos;t do the work, you will not get a good grade. I would recommend this university to any working adult who does not have time to go to college the traditional way. If you enjoy independent learning and don&apos;t have to be in a classroom,  you will like CSU.  I am a senior at CSU, graduating this year. I do not feel like my degree is being handed to me; I have worked hard for the degree that I will receive.

I have been taking my kids there for 3 years and they love it. My first born started as a baby, and my other child started at 6 weeks old. The staff is incredibly helpful and takes the time to get to know each child and their needs. I get a hand written report daily that lets me know what times their diapers were changed, how long they napped, and what they ate. Sometimes when I come to pick my kids up they don&apos;t even want to leave because they are too busy playing with the other kids and the teachers. They have excellent playing areas. The &quot;big kid&quot; playground has plenty of jungle gyms, swings, bikes, etc. as well as a lot of grass for them to run around and play tag. The teachers are always out there playing with them games such as duck duck goose, and red rover. The little kid playground has lots of smaller toys for the toddlers and the teachers are always pushing the babies in the swings. The meals are included in your tuition and my son always talks about how good the food is. He especially loves when they have corn dog nuggets. The center even has a K-4 program that my son will be starting next year that I am so excited for. Overall, I have seen a huge difference in my children compared to other peoples children who do not go to Kid Plus. My children are far more advanced due to the hardwork and dedication the teachers put into each child. They don&apos;t just sit them down in front of a TV or send them to the playground to do whatever they want. Every day is structured with a schedule which helps us out at home because my son has a routine, which helps his behavior out a lot. The teachers always do crafts as well, my fridge is covered in a million different pictures my kids have done over the years. They always bring home sweet little poems with handprints for mothers/fathers day. The teachers also try to have parties for the different holidays and nothing makes my kids happier than bringing cupcakes to school and getting to share them with their friends. I would reccommend Kid Plus to every parent out there. I could not imagine having a better day care facility to take my kids to. In fact, I will be sad when my oldest has to leave day care to go to the elementary school. I will probably leave him in their after school program so I can pick up both my children at once.\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":3.5,\"reviewCount\":3}}"]},

They offer studies in the fine arts and in the Italian language, and I only studied art, so I have no idea how the Italian education was.  The school&apos;s art &apos;curriculum&apos; is very misleading, seeing as they actually have none, and a lot of the &apos;subjects&apos; they supposedly had only exist if you bring it up to the teacher yourself.  I think that the only redeeming quality about the school was the very dedicated teacher at the time, who was very knowledgable, pushed his students to do better, and clearly loved art.  Two out of three of the people who run the school didn&apos;t seem to care very much about the students nor their experience at the school, which is probably why some students were unhappy with the structure of the school if they were studying there long-term.  I&apos;m not sure who the main art teacher is right now.  This very tiny school is a good option if you want a very simple and basic experience in Florence and in the arts, because you do get a lot of freedom to just study whatever you feel like doing.  In that case it&apos;s really nice, and a great option for people who want to learn art basics!  Also, they&apos;ll provide very, very basic art supplies if you need them.  However, I would not recommend staying there longer than 3 months at the most -- any more than that would be repetitive and the certificate in the fine arts that they offer doesn&apos;t seem to be very official.  If you want a long-term study look into another school or even better, a university!

Because I studied Italian before, I didn&apos;t want to learn the language from the very beginning. This way I could start at my own level, together with students who where as far as I was. It wasn&apos;t hard for me to get along with the other students, because they would make the same errors as I did. I was in a class with Rafaella and she is very sympathetic. She includes everyone and even though we only spoke Italian, she made everything very clear.  If someone makes a mistake, she takes the time to explain. This also makes lessons very intense. One lesson, that takes about four hours, can maybe consist of only the grammar of one aspect. We could talk about irregular verbs and tenses very extensively. Because of this I wished I could follow the course longer than two weeks, because not everything of my level, B1, could be covered. But for me, because I study Italian at home, it gives me the opportunity to ask questions whenever I do not understand something. I like the fact that there is enough room to make mistakes, I didn&apos;t feel &apos;stupid&apos; at any time.  Rafaella will help you if you have a hard time putting sentences together. \\n\\nPractically: the school has a great location, in the heart of the centre. It is nice to walk to town when lessons are over. Also the school doesn&apos;t feel very &apos;crowded&apos;. Its groups are small. When you are alone, the school provides tours with a guide and cooking lessons and aperitivi, which are great to do if you don&apos;t know the city and you want someone to tell you where you should go ;-) I really felt like the teachers and the staff in general know what they are doing, making everyone as comfortable as possible.

I am also an educator. I must say that this administration, as far as European administration goes, is superior in its customer service.  They are sensitive, efficient, and genuinely kind even to difficult students.  Specifically, there was a clerical error with my tuition. I was panicked as I didn&apos;t speak the language fluently and realized how difficult this situation could be.  Fortunately I saved all the necessary documents (as one should) showing that I had already payed.  As I approached the desk asking about the notification, documents in hand and ready to &apos;prove&apos; my case, the director simply stated that he was sorry, and that it was a filing error on their end, and there was nothing to worry about.  No questions, no proof needed, and nothing but smiles and relief on their end. \\n\\nAlso they have a &apos;welcome&apos; package all ready for their new students.  It&apos;s full of little tidbits that will help you get through the first few weeks on your own. So thoughtful!  They make you feel welcome, are very sensitive to any anxieties you may have about being there, and can manage different levels of fluency in Italian seeing as the administration speaks a great deal of other languages fluently. (I personally witnessed, not only English, but Japanese, Spanish and Hungarian.) \\n\\nSecondly, the scaffolding of the educational system is very well done.  There were classes for beginners of all levels, intermediate studiers, and even for those who wanted to master the language.  Outside of grammer and conversation, are myriad classes to take, I chose the COOKING class with Signora Fiammetti. I have to say that this cooking course was far superior to any of the cooking courses I attempted to take in France.  When I tried to do my research to find a place in France to do this, I found that either the prices were outrageous OR the skill level of the educators in the kitched were disappointing either in the language pedagogy OR in the skills/products used or made in the kitchen.  Neither of these were true about the cooking course I took.  Signora Fiammetti is a professionally trained chef/caterer, raised in Tuscany/Italy and trained in Paris.  Her organization was unbeatable, exceptionally well paced, and her tips on cooking were among the top I have ever seen.  I am no stranger to the kitchen, but she was able to give me a very wide range of tips, even on the basics of cutting an onion, or tearing basil.  The 4 course meals we prepared were unbelievable in the subtleties of flavors and the colorful presentation of food.  If you are a lover of food and cooking, I highly HIGHLY recommend this as an option.  I also have to say that our course had about 3-4 people in it, and of different levels of fluency in Italian. No matter!  We still spoke whatever level of italian we were equipped with, and her patience and teaching skills still helped us learn while we were cooking!  Incredible!\\n\\nLastly,  the teachers were so well adapted for their subject matter.  One member of my family was in the beginners level, while I found myself in the advanced group.  The instructors for beginners had, for people just getting used to the language,  teachers with an unparalleled amount of patience, kindness, organization and genuinity.  The advanced group had teachers that were of university-level brilliance in their subject matter (literature, language, etc.) and while at times their pedagogy seemed unfamiliar, I found myself challenged not only on a linguistic level, but an intellectual level as well. The extra tours with Caterina were fantastic!!!\\n\\nAreas of improvement:  \\n\\nAir conditioning:  During the hot months (and I imagine the same of the cold months) the lack of air conditioning made the learning particularly difficult for everyone in the class.  \\n\\nPedagogy (differentiated instruction for different groups taught) schoolwide is probably needed on a small level.  Therefore it might be a good idea for the administration to sit in on all classes from time to time to comment on style of instruction and just to provide feedback.  Also, perhaps all the teachers get together periodically to discuss methods. I feel that it would improve the solidarity of the school and increase the available methodologies of instruction between teachers. Strengths of each teacher can benefit the entire school in this way.\\n\\nIn summary, I would easily go back to this school.  The school is unbelievably rewarding for anyone wanting to learn about not just Tuscany, but Italy in general!

It&apos;s great to see growth.  I&apos;m going to give an un-biased report:\\n\\nI scored around a 2300 through prepping here, back when the &quot;new&quot; SAT was new.  I took the SAT once on my own and prepped through 2 more SATs here, and after prepping with them, obtained a perfect score on the Writing.  I also ACT-prepped here twice and got a 34 (out of 36).\\n\\nThe Academy helped plan my academic path early on and naturally, I used their college prep services, and got into Columbia University, University of Chicago, Northwestern, Georgetown, etc (oddly enough, I was waitlisted at University of Washington in St. Louis, though lol).  It came down to Columbia and Northwestern, but I ended up going to NU.\\n\\nOne thing I must emphasize about their college prep program is that it is truly comprehensive.  Like, they help you from A to Z and beyond.  Their philosophy is &quot;Let me help you get your kid into his/her Harvard,&quot; but they don&apos;t stop there.  They aggressively focus on scholarships.  I got a full ride merit-scholarship into Northwestern (whereas, ivy league schools don&apos;t usually give scholarships but are great with financial aid if you need a lot of it).  So, at first, I was a bit sad not to go to Columbia, but in the end and looking back, I was really pleased that I walked out of college debt-free AND got a stellar education.\\n(P.S.- back in the day, Columbia was ranked #9 and Northwestern was #11, so it made little difference ranking-wise where I chose to go.  In 2013, Columbia is at #4).\\n\\nSo, even though I may SOUND biased, I mean, I did walk out with fantastically improved scores, a fantastic college prep package, and got into my absolute top choice schools.  I got results--and not just any, but the ones I wanted.\\nI am not writing this because I work here, or because I was asked to.  I try to be a very honest person in life, and I would never have chosen to work here if I didn&apos;t think their services or philosophy was up to par.  The truth is, I decided to teach here because I agree with the philosophy and practices.  They truly care about education and each student.  I&apos;ve seen the founders help less privileged students by writing off hours and giving them scholarships, and I saw them do this before the company became bigger--usually the time of initial &quot;company growth&quot; is not the time most business people act so generous.  They&apos;re not in it for the money, they&apos;re in it because education makes the world a better place.  Their kids both went to phenomenal undergraduate and graduate programs but are working/will be working in the public service sector.\\n\\nTrust me, and not just because I work here (though, it should encourage you to come, as I did score in the 99% and am one of their best tutors), if you are passionate about your education and being/becoming successful, you want to be here.  There is no other place you&apos;d personally want to be, or send your kid.

It&apos;s true. But what is it that makes them a disgrace? Why do they deserve such a title?\\n\\nLet&apos;s examine their academics. Often a freshman-level class is remedial in nature. English classes center around basic grammar, middle school-level vocabulary, and the basics of writing a paper. These are the things one should have learned prior to college. And while a review of the basics can be a good thing, students and their parents are paying thousands of dollars for these remedial courses for the first semester or two! The jump in difficulty after the first year is not something to be ignored either. The average student has to suffer through intensely difficult classes after taking a year to settle into an easier pace. And students soon discover that the grading system used is more of a measuring stick for how much you failed.\\n\\nYou see, students are not treated with respect at this school unless they have proven themselves to the faculty. There are many students who deserve respect at Bob Jones, but unless you&apos;re a suck up or a tattle tale, you often are regarded as nothing by the school. I&apos;ve seen students work extremely hard throughout the year only to be humiliated during class by the teacher. And I&apos;ve seen students glide through semesters because they were suck ups of the worst kind. Now, don&apos;t get me wrong, not all the teachers are bad. But in my experience, there were three kinds of teachers. There were the GAs, which were students working through graduate school. The GAs were pretty much all friendly and helpful. Then there were a handful of good teachers, Dr. Ormiston is an example of a tough but caring teacher. And then you have the rest of the teachers who looked down on most of their students. \\n\\nIn the end, those who manage to make it through to graduation, will find that in most places, their degree is worthless. Because despite what BJU advertises, they aren&apos;t actually accredited. Sure, they&apos;re &quot;accredited&quot; by a group of southern religious schools, but that doesn&apos;t mean anything outside of Christian circles. That&apos;s four years (at least) and thousands upon thousands of dollars wasted, unless you plan to get a job with Bob Jones. And that would probably work out, since those that make it through are trained to think just like the school wants them to think. Students are not prepared for the outside world. The students are trained to fear the secular world, and jump at the mention of something unbiblical. One might call this level of conditioning &quot;brainwashing.&quot; And that wouldn&apos;t be too far off.\\n\\nYou see, despite claiming the Bible to be their foundation, the school actually wrote their own book of authority. This handbook claims to be inspired by the Bible. But that is an outright lie. While other schools might have rules like &quot;Don&apos;t run in the halls.&quot; or &quot;Don&apos;t bring drugs to school.&quot; BJU&apos;s rules are &quot;Don&apos;t be outside your dormitory past 10:30 PM.&quot; and &quot;Don&apos;t bring an iPod on campus.&quot; In a dystopian fashion, the lives of all the students, be they on or off campus, is invaded by the school&apos;s rules. Regulations cover everything from the kind of music they can listen to all the way down having to ask permission to leave campus. Students actually sign a contract that basically states that they will not exercise their first amendment rights.In fact, the school is so paranoid, that they reserve the right to revoke a graduate&apos;s diploma within the first three months after a student graduates. There is no appeal process for this. The school can literally make all those years worthless if they decide that you are not the kind of person they want you to be. Of course, they&apos;ll keep all the tuition they took from you.\\n\\nFinally, BJU ignores the concept of grace, while flaunting the concept of judgment. Students have to fear for their safety, lest they break a rule. Students are forced to fill out forms about what they did over break. If they broke any of the rules, they are subject to discipline. If a student is struggling with sin in their life, they cannot seek help. Because the most help a student is offered is mandatory therapy sessions. And that can still come with a side of demerits bringing them closer to suspension or expulsion. They practically thrive on punishing wrongdoers. Unless  the wrongdoer is on their board of directors, as was the case a couple of years ago. It was then that they virtually threatened the entire student body to be silent about what happened. \\n\\nBJU is a disgrace. I urge you to stay away.\"},{\"author\":\"Austin A.\",\"datePublished\":\"2018-02-14\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":1},\"description\":\"Beautiful campus, there are some lovely people there.

Founded in 1826, Furman is the oldest private\u00a0university in South Carolina. The school is named for Richard Furman, a clergyman considered the most important Baptist leader before the Civil War. Furman was pastor of the First Baptist Church in Charleston, S.C., and became the first president of the Triennial Convention, the first national body of Baptists in America. The South Carolina Baptist Convention established Furman&apos;s original campus in Edgefield, S.C., but over the next three decades, the campus changed locations three times before arriving in downtown Greenville, S.C. in 1851. Originally founded as a men&apos;s academy and theological institute, the theological school broke away from Furman in 1858 to become the Southern Baptist Seminary. In 1924, Furman was named one of four collegiate beneficiaries of the Duke Endowment. The Duke Endowment grants sustained Furman through the Great Depression, helped the university coordinate with Greenville Woman&apos;s College in the 1930s, and bolstered the university&apos;s effort to pursue a new campus location. Furman broke ground on its current location north of its home city in 1953. The school would also become independent in 1992, breaking ties with the South Carolina Baptist Convention. It is a wonderful campus the RASMAN says go there and just walk around. Go watch a game.\"},{\"author\":\"Amanda O.\",\"datePublished\":\"2014-02-10\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":4},\"description\":\"Beautiful and welcoming campus with great walking paths.

(See picture, had I not been in a hurry that day I think I would have indulged in a full line of services and took many more pictures of the mottos on the walls).\\n\\nThe students and instructors, most of whom I did notice were younger and female, had well put together looks...ranging from conservative to alternative/experimental. The clientele that day were like myself: ranging from middle aged women up to the elderly. \\n\\nThe young lady who did my hair consult seemed to immediately understand my hair type and I opted to get wash and waves similar to what she was wearing that day. I was going to get a trim but it wasn&apos;t necessary and I like that she didn&apos;t talk me into unneeded services, something I have unfortunately experienced at many salons.\\n\\nWe had a good chat about a variety of topics as she worked on my look. \\n\\nI left there feeling more confident. I should have took a before picture, as my hair was a complete humidity-trashed messed when I had arrived. \\n\\nThe only downfall to the experience is despite a light dusting of hairspray, my look didn&apos;t last two days as I was hoping; it lasted twelve hours. I don&apos;t know whether to attribute that to my hair or maybe it needed the humidity-proof hairspray I have used in the past, but all in all, I give Kristen and the others a 5 out of 5 and will definitely return when I am in the area again one day.\"},{\"author\":\"Kelly C.\",\"datePublished\":\"2020-09-11\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"Here&apos;s an update!

The courses will challenge you and the college is at a great price.  And before any of you go running away at the challenge, remember that the challenge is what you learn from and need to overcome.  In many of the programs you will learn more than your education, and will find a staff that has your success in mind.  The extra things I learned were patience, professionalism, and the courage to seek clarity like a pro and within academic policies and chains of command.

I have to disagree with the person who said that this college is as easy as or easier than high school. Yes, most of the work you submit is essays; however, that is the challenging part.  The coursework is very rigorous. I have attended both a b&amp;m college as well as CSU, so I can attest that this college is definitely harder. You can&apos;t plagiarize essays because they use Turn It In for many of the classes and major points are deducted if the redundancy rate is too high. I have had this happen, even when none of my material was plagiarized. So, I had to learn to use more of my own words and and not quote so much material. If you can easily write essays, you might consider this university easy. However, if you struggle with writing and thoughts don&apos;t come as easily to you, like me, then you might have a different view of this school. In one class alone, I had to write 18 essays. It would be much easier to have multiple choice, like I did in high school or like I did when I went to my b&amp;m college.  However, I will say that I have retained more information through my coursework at CSU than I have at any other school. I retain more information when I have to write than when I have to just memorize information for a short term. There is no extra credit or making up assignments. If you don&apos;t do the work, you will not get a good grade. I would recommend this university to any working adult who does not have time to go to college the traditional way. If you enjoy independent learning and don&apos;t have to be in a classroom,  you will like CSU.  I am a senior at CSU, graduating this year. I do not feel like my degree is being handed to me; I have worked hard for the degree that I will receive. This journey has been more time consuming and stressful than I could have ever imagined, but well worth it!\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":4,\"reviewCount\":20}}"]},

Telling parents to come pick up their child cause they are sick when in fact they are not, gives them 2 days automatically out of the week to not have to care for your child.

Apparently, they were really excited about trying it and it seems like it was the first time they were performing this technique. I understand that students are working on our hair and am open to improving their learning experience, but I did not like the job done on my hair at all. The teacher seems to know what she was doing, but the student messed up a few times. I did not think anything of it at the time because I knew she was still learning while working on my hair and I thought that the teacher was fixing it as she went. Anyways, long story short, there is so much damage to my hair and I have to cut 3 inches off now despite putting oil on it everyday along with taking really good care of it. It&apos;s not my first time getting my hair dyed, so I know how to minimize damage. Also, she did not ombre it. It looks more like highlights starting at one point on my hair and does not blend into a gradient at all. It has a lot of chunky pieces and some parts of my hair near the roots are really light and my ends is really dark. I didn&apos;t noticed it at the salon because of the lighting, but it&apos;s very noticeable. Anyways, I would not go here again because all of the hard work I put into growing my hair out just to get it ombre is completely ruined. I&apos;m basically cutting off what I paid Winonah to do. That&apos;s a waste 70 dollars that I could have used at a normal salon that would have done a better job.

Children who were mild mannered were often paired with children who were aggressive and out of control because &quot;they could handle it&quot; even though they were only children. My child specifically was paired with an aggressive child because my child was mild mannered and they considered him a &quot;good influence&quot;. While I understand that helping out others should be encouraged, 8 year olds are not counselors and certainly should not be responsible for dealing with aggressive children. When our children left that school, my youngest was a full year behind in math when we transferred to another local school. I was never contacted about there being a problem at all. I also volunteered to be at the school for special events or whatever, but was never called. As a matter of fact, I felt parental involvement was highly discouraged instead of encouraged.

I took my 9 year old son there for an assessment. While he was testing I had the opportunity to listen (because he is very loud, and never shut the door) to him talking to another parent and child. The way he describes things is very &quot;dumbed down&quot; almost like he thinks people other than him won&apos;t understand what he is trying to say. I also heard him tell a child that &quot;if they are bad, he puts them in a room in the back and locks the door and turns off the light&quot;. Of course he said he was kidding, but something in his demeanor maybe question if he really was. Nonetheless, I went back the following week to get my sons test scores. I had to bring my two year old daughter because she had a doctor appointment immediately prior.

It is co-located with a library that is only accesible to Troy students. They have metered street parking right out front and within a reasonable walking distance.\\n\\nThe site of the museum is significant because it is where Rosa Parks was arrested on a bus for not giving up her seat. It has a historical marker out front marking the location. It has a neat sculpture outside that can only be viewed directly, any other angles and you are looking at some posts in the group.  There is also a very nice sculpture of Ms. Parks sitting alone in her seat on the bus. It makes for great photos.\\n\\nThe museum is small and offers self guided tours. There are no pictures allowed in the main exhibit area. The tour begins in a small room with benches around it. You watch a movie about segregation in Montgomery, the bus system and the boycott. Once the movie is over, some doors open and leads you to the next area. The next area is a pretty neat reenactment of Rosa Parks being arrested on the bus. You view the action as if you are viewing it from outside of the bus. It is very nice and really makes you feel like you are in the action. \\n\\n After the reenactment on the bus, some doors open up to a gallery that has exhibits, videos, artifacts, and pictures. You move at your own pace from this spot until the end of the tour. You will see a replica carpool vehicle over there, you will also hear stories told by people that were there during that time via videos and you will see a display of leaders riding the bus after the boycott ended. They give you the option of using your phone for an audio tour in a few sections of the museum. It provides you some information about what you are looking at. I did not use it because it seemed like more effort than what it was worth to me. Some type of push button audio kiosk would be perfect in its place. Anyway, as i mentioned, the exhibit area is not a very big area. We went through it in about 15 minutes.. The entire tour took us about 30 minutes. Even though thee is not a lot to it, it was still a nice visit and I  learned a bit. It does a good job making you feel as if you are back during that time.\\n\\nNo museum would be complete without a gift shop, this one is no exception. They have a small gift shop where you not only purchase you museum admission, but you can buy souvenirs like shirts or bags.\\n\\nAll-in-all this a decent museum. I love that it is located on the historical site where the bus incident occurred. It is small, but still makes a great impact. It&apos; is definitely worth a visit if you are in downtown Montgomery. I would recommend checking out some of the other nearby museums, like the Legacy Museum and Civil Rights Center to maximize your trip.\"},{\"author\":\"Penny S.\",\"datePublished\":\"2022-04-18\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"This museum is two parts - our family of five just did the museum experience.

On the second floor is a photo timeline of Civil Rights events and informational columns highlighting the important faces of the movement and their story.\\n\\nBack in the main building is a gift shop, exhibition art hall and a self guided tour highlighting the famous story of Rosa Louise McCauley Parks and her defiance to give up her seat on that faithful day. What I never knew about the history of this event was that it wasn&apos;t altogether random. Rosa Parks planned to do this with the help of other civil rights leaders so they could use it as a launching point for a federal case against the unconstitutional segregation laws in Alabama. It was only an idea, but Rosa fulfilled it when she found the opportunity, because it couldn&apos;t be staged. That takes nothing away from Rosa Parks. The danger of such defiance was deadly real, as witnessed by the Freedom Riders in the same era.\\n\\nOddly, the case was not brought to court using Rosa. Instead they used the first person to actually defy the bus laws, young Claudette Colvin, whom was 15 and pregnant at the age of her arrest. Her arrest happened on March 2nd, 1955, a full 9 months before Rosa&apos;s arrest on December 1, 1955.\\n\\nThe story is told using a full sized model of a Montgomery bus as you stand outside of the bus looking through the windows (which utilize TV screens). The bus is set in a room that looks like a small movie set with buildings, a faux street and streetlights. Here is a link to a Youtube video of this exhibit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h82ajl69iy0\\n\\nOVERALL it is a great experience, especially when coupled with the other Civil Rights museums in the downtown area. Not far away from the RP Library the City of Montgomery is working to construct a park and monument @ the site of the famous bus stop where Rosa boarded. Not sure when it will be ready as digging was underway during our May 2019 visit. The Library is actually the location of the arrest. Both the Time Machine exhibit in the Children&apos;s Annex and the Bus Arrest exhibit in the main building are must see&apos;s when visiting Montgomery Alabama and the Freedom Trail.

Inside a big room sat an over-sized replica of a bus surrounded by used computer parts and lights that were intended to make the place look like you were traveling back in time. I don&apos;t know if I would have called it creepy - but with him being the only person in the room, I can see why he wanted me to hurry up and get there so they could start. That&apos;s right.. it was just the two of us along for the trip through time.\\n\\nThe feature started and Mr. Rivetts, our &quot;bus driver&quot; (which looked like the robot from the movie Short Circuit) took us on a trip through time starting in Cincinnati meeting a young boy named Jim Crow and ended up in the 1950&apos;s after being introduced to Mrs Parks. While definitely geared towards children, it was worthwhile to go through. There were TV&apos;s throughout the entire room and the walls became projection screens, so even if the room was packed with students on a field trip, everyone would be able to see.\\n\\nAfter going through the Children&apos;s part, our admission also got us into the 1955 and beyond part of the exhibit. A much smaller room was waiting on us with very few seats, but we sat down and watched interviews on three projectors and learned more about Rosa Parks specifically. After about 15 minutes of watching this, the automatic doors opened and we were outside on a street corner in 1955 watching and listening on the city bus when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat. \\n\\nThe rest of the tour was a self-guided walking tour of the bus boycott, church meetings, police reports and historic memorabilia. As I walked through the museum, I thought to myself many times &quot;I can&apos;t believe this happened only 50 years ago!&quot; \\n\\nLearning about this in the history books is one thing.. walking the streets of Montgomery and seeing it unfold on a likelike tour is something completely different.

After a trip to the Civil Rights Museum, we stopped by here.  Without a doubt, the Rosa Parks tour features the most interactive and engaging setup that I have ever seen.  After passing the ticket gate, visitors are invited to watch an opening video on a three-panel television display mounted high above.  Given that we were a large group, seating was insufficient, but we didn&apos;t seem to take issue with plopping down on the floor.  In retrospect, it gave the video a drive-in sort of feel.\\n\\nThe next stop was an audiovisual tour of the Montgomery bus boycott.  A facsimile of the bus appeared against a wall.  Audio recordings simulated Ms. Park&apos;s refusal to vacate her seat; though Rosa&apos;s voice actor&apos;s speech was a bit slow, I appreciated the accompanying voices&apos; authenticity until the moment of her arrest.  This part of the museum was very dark, so I would urge visitors to be careful navigating this space.  The doors opened to reveal a walking exhibit of the planning and aftermath of the bus boycott.  The guide continued to walk among the exhibits and ushered us through them.  When we got to the end of the walk, double doors featured an audio recording of a MLK sermon; at its end, visitors were invited to walk through them, simulating a church revival service.  The tour ended shortly thereafter.\\n\\nI think the only thing I have to recommend is being told what else is in this building.  I suppose it worked out well since we had additional stops planned.

We traveled to  Birmingham and Auburn researching schools and neighborhoods. After a number of area visits, meetings with real estate agents and tours of homes, nothing seemed to fit.  So at one point  we looked upward and ask God, &quot;this isn&apos;t working out, do you have other plans&quot;?\\n\\nHe then began to unveil His plan. That was to look at private schools in the Montgomery area. The cost would be significant, however, after running the numbers, we realized the cost of moving coupled with the premium for housing, we would actually save money over five years. \\n\\nWe began to reach out to private schools and narrowed our search to two. One a Christian school and the other, Saint James, a secular school. We then began communications with the admission office. \\nThey were amazing. Their processing of new applicants was as well orchestrated and professional as one could have imagined. \\nNext came the course selection process. Once again, this team was very engaged in guiding us along as we chose the academic course levels and electives. \\n\u00a0\\nDuring the open house event, we heard from the head of school, Dr. McLemore, and the middle school principal Dr. Taylor. They deftly handled the power outage that evening and carried on without the use of lights or PowerPoint. They didn&apos;t miss a beat. The handout materials they provided during that meeting were well thought out and very useful. \\n\\nFinally, after meeting with each of the teachers, we gained so much confidence that God had led us to the right school. We had scoured Birmingham and Auburn in our quest to find the right culture and environment best suited to prepare our son for college and life. As it turned out, that school was Saint James. \\n\\nEveryone we have met has been so helpful, communicative, responsive, and professional. Even the parking lot attendant is a great guy! \\nThe consistency, professionalism, courtesy, communications and passion to the education, emotional and psychological well being of our children has been such a constant theme throughout our Saint James experience. \\n\\nWhile we initially had some reservations over choosing a secular college preparatory school over a Christian school, as it turned out, Saint James is staffed with teachers and administrators who lives are marked by Christ.

Dave Gaines who is the Board Chair, the Chief Executive Officer and of course the only paid employee of SASSNA (per his website) was almost 20 minutes late for my sons IEP and wanted me to leave the IEP meeting to meet him in the parking lot and walk him in; I kindly declined as we had already started the meeting. When Mr. Gaines finally got there he all but demanded the Wi-Fi password, stating he needed the Wi-Fi to take notes, unfortunately the Wi-Fi wasn&apos;t strong enough. Then he insisted we start the meeting over by getting him up to speed and repeat everything we had talked about. He repeatedly asked us to stop and go over the same information over and over. Mr. Gaines was very aggressive and rude to the entire IEP team, even saying how much more of a professional he was than them. I was very pleased with the services and accommodations that the school was offering and I really felt that they were going above and beyond, but Mr. Gaines was not happy. He was talking over us, interrupting us and disagreeing with the services and accommodations that I wanted for my son. It was to the point where I felt my &quot;advocate&quot; was against me and I was embarrassed to have a brought an advocate that wasn&apos;t listening to me in my own child&apos;s IEP meeting. I even had to tell him to stop, that I was happy with where the meeting was going and I wanted to try the services they were offering. His response to me was that my child was not an experiment to try things on. His justification for his behavior was that he thought we were dealing with my son&apos;s previous school in which there was a formal complaint made, however I had made it clear this was our first year at this school, and in any case, I don&apos;t think his aggressive and unprofessional behavior would have been any less embarrassing at any school, in any situation.\\nSecondly, before I had accepted Dave&apos;s offer for &quot;help&quot; I was registered as a volunteer with his organization and had donated money to SASSNA. Since August of 2016, to this date I have donated $550 to SASSNA. During my last fundraiser I partnered with another non-profit that helped families through the holidays. I had solicited sponsors and donations for this event along with a partner from the other non-profit. From this event I was able to donate $250 to SASSNA with another promised donation of $125, which I never received. Mr. Gaines become absolutely irate and belligerent with me as the time passed and the additional $125 was not donated to him due to me not receiving it. He began messaging me, cussing at me and calling me names like moron, unintelligent, scum, inappropriately sensitive when I expressed myself, a dumb arrogant child and dumb on numerous occasions, to which I still have all the messages. I told him I no longer wished to volunteer for his organization he began messaging my husband as well, even telling him not to bother responding in my defense and &quot;don&apos;t get dumb on me now too&quot;. Mr. Gaines has stated he is going to sue me for being unable to DONATE the $125 to him, in which he has since received via cashier&apos;s check and mail, but since we did not send it via certified mail or personal check; he says we have no proof and good luck proving it(we also have this message). The woman who partnered with me on the last fundraiser is my sons step mother and the one who sent the cashier&apos;s check on my behalf to get Mr. Gaines to leave me alone; she didn&apos;t want to send a personal check because she doesn&apos;t want him knowing where she lives. I have had to block him from my phone and social media sites but he has now started emailing me on my Gmail account. It&apos;s so bad that my husband and sons step mother have had to block him from all methods of contact due to the continuous calls and belligerent messages. I now have legal representation if he chooses to summon me to court, which my attorney has assured me he has no grounds for a law suit. If the harassment continues I am considering a police report, which I have told him that if he doesn&apos;t leave me alone I will do; his response was &quot;You&apos;re a comedian. File a police report. They won&apos;t care&quot;.\\nFor someone who works with children and special needs children at that, I find his use of language very offensive. How can you work with intellectually challenged children but throw around words like &quot;moron&quot; and &quot;dumb&quot; so freely? Also I couldn&apos;t be more concerned that he even works with children at all considering his explosive temper and the way he lashes out! I also don&apos;t recommend adults to do business with him either considering the treatment I have received from him.\"},{\"author\":\"Shasta T.\",\"datePublished\":\"2016-10-15\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"I would like to acknowledge Dave Gaines, the CEO of Sacramento Autistic Spectrum and Special Needs Alliance for generously r planning to me my rights in regards to my son and his he could help me if I need it.

But I think this time is worth it. \\n\\nWe love this day care!!!! Moving from NY to NJ without knowing anyone or the area was hard for the entire family and having to find a daycare for our 1 1/2 year old was even harder. It was his first time in daycare, so it was a big decision for all of us. We tried looking at the reviews but there weren&apos;t many and some were useless and ridiculous. We visited a couple of daycares in the area, but TLE Union was our favorite. We liked it since we set foot on it. The tour was very welcoming and the people were nice. The entire place was clean and organized. We all loved the decorations, even my baby, who stopped on every wall to contemplate the pictures and colors and he didn&apos;t want to leave. So we decided to enroll him in the Toddler class. His teachers were Agatha, Catherine, Melanie and Jasmin. We can&apos;t thank them enough for all the patience and care they had with our baby. He cried every single morning for the longest time, but no matter how much he cried, they welcomed him every morning with a smile, a big hug and love. Eventually he stopped crying and started asking in the morning if he was going to go to school that day, because he wanted to go!!! Also the front desk girls are amazing, specially Jessica, who had to take my multiple calls to check on my baby for the longest time until I had to learn not to call because he was fine. He moved to Twaddler class at the beginning of this year and he loves it! His teachers are Rebecca, Melanie and Wendy. They also are amazing and give him so much love and care. He is learning so much, counting numbers, days of the week, colors, months of the year, telling us stories, and all his classmates names. It&apos;s been a year now since he started and we are as happy as we were at the beginning. They make lots of activities during the day, each month they celebrate something different so lots of activities related to it, each week there&apos;s something fun for the kids like wacky hair day, pijama day, crazy socks day, battle of colors between classrooms, and many more. Food is good (snacks, lunch and afternoon snack), a party here and there with pizza and goodies, tuition is not cheap but not expensive, it is fair and after seeing the way they take care of our baby, we are happy to pay it. Halloween was awesome with the &quot;trunk or treat&quot; in the parking lot. Another amazing thing about it is the app where we get live updates of what our kid is doing, pictures of him during activities, lunch, nap time, daily reports and important notifications such as future activities, school&apos;s closures, etc. \\n\\nI hope this review gives you the help I didn&apos;t have when I was looking for daycare and gives the school an idea of how happy they make the parents because of their great work. It was hard to leave my baby to go to work and even harder and scary to have to leave him with strangers, but that feeling didn&apos;t last long because I realized the good hands I was leaving him with.

The contract stated dessert plates , we didn&apos;t have any.\\nI didn&apos;t understand why the party helpers / assistants stayed in the back room the whole time after the slime activity was completed. We had no help with the photo booth ,Pinta activities and giving out cake . I was very disappointed and exhausted after the party . When we spoke prior to the party  I recall asking if we can arrive early to set up(1/2 hour) and you stated yes, I don&apos;t recall you stating there would a $30 fee , only a fee if party went past the time.The party did not start on time , and I felt rushed to get out at the end . No engagement from Staff , Myself or other guest had to open the door when guest arrive  . Not you or any of your staff even said happy birthday to my child. I never saw a smile from you or your staff during the slime activity. During the face painting, my daughter was next to last to get her face painted!! I thought the birthday child goes first!!

But most times we are not aware of the location or the upkeep of the studio... Express yourself studio is pretty good with all the cosmetic part of the studio.  It is clean, pretty much organized.  They have a clean restroom for it&apos;s clients,  a coat hanger.  It&apos;s BYOB and they also provide cups,  wine opener and tissue for ur wine. \\nI purchased groupon for wine glass paint afternoon with few girls celebrating a birthday. Instructors and her daughter we&apos;re setting up the tables for the class when we walked in.  They greeted us and showed us where to out our coats and where the bottle opener and cups were.  The instructor also showed us where to sit as we we&apos;re group of 9 girls. They provided us with brushes,  water,  paper towel,  paper,  colors and pencil.  Because this was her first wine glass paint session she wasn&apos;t sure what will work most effectively , so she asked us to choose our own design. I was prepared but some others were not. I think next time they should be prepared for students who a don&apos;t have designs for their art work.  Some student who don&apos;t known how to paint or bad at painting,  may be they need to help those students out and be more interactive with the clients.  It&apos;s a class that means instructor is there to help if there is any difficulty with getting art from mind on to the glass or canvas. So they need to be more interactive. Also it was my first glass paint class I wanted to learn more technique or paint on the glass.  Instructor needs to teach students proper techniques to paint on glass,  canvas, paper anyclass. \\nOverall it think they still need to develop some strategy before class to better assist their clients,  because people take these classes for fun but to learn the techniques or these different work of art.

SJKP offers curbside drop off and pick up.  If this is convenient for you, great.  If, however, you are like me and enjoy walking your child into his/her classroom and getting them settled before hugging and kissing them goodbye for the day, you will be discouraged from doing so.  Although I was told during my tour that &quot;parents are always welcome in the classroom,&quot; I was asked by the teacher to say my goodbyes outside the door and not come in (this was also later formalized in a memo from the director to all parents).  When you pick up and drop off your child this way (in a rush at the curb with a line of other parents waiting), you get no feedback from your child&apos;s teacher(s) about his or her day and no real opportunity to communicate your own questions, concerns or comments.  I felt alienated and found it very dismaying and distressing.  \\n\\n2. Nap time policy is that children do not have to sleep, but if they do not sleep, they are expected to rest quietly on their mats with no toys, books, or other distractions for approximately two hours (I don&apos;t know any adults that could do this with no phone, book, tv, etc, let alone a two-year-old).  My child is not a napper.  We struggled with this the whole time he was there.  If I didn&apos;t ask if he napped, no one told me.  They waited until it was so bad (he was yelling, kicking walls, and causing a major ruckus) to tell me on a Friday that he would not be welcome back for naptime starting Monday.  There is no alternative available to a non-napper.\\n\\n3.  During summer session, they rotated teachers every couple of weeks so leadership was very inconsistent for my child.  They were loose on the &quot;rules&quot; so when the school session started in August, we had to overcome two and a half months of letting certain things go, then backtrack to reestablish what would be expected of him.\\n\\n4. Because I was discouraged from entering the classroom, I had no idea who my child&apos;s classmates were, and I rarely had the chance to meet any other parents.  \\n\\n5. This school&apos;s philosophy is very centered on obedience.  When a child is &quot;disobedient,&quot; he/she is sent to the director&apos;s office.  My son told me once (and remember, this is a two year old!), that &quot;Mrs. [director&apos;s name] was very angry to me.&quot;  I found this attitude to be very unrealistic for such young children, and that it limited creativity and independence.  \\n\\nI removed my son from this facility after approximately four months.\"},{\"author\":\"Kalle C.\",\"datePublished\":\"2018-03-22\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":1},\"description\":\"This school was recommended by another good school so I figured it would be ok. I went for a walk through &amp; it appeared to be a nice looking school. I was told my daughter would be able to attend the school &amp; they had plenty of room. The next couple weeks following about two weeks to be exact I completed the application and tried for a couple days to get in contact with someone. Which I find very odd that I called this school, their main phone number and always went to voicemail. I&apos;ve never seen a school that doesn&apos;t answer their main phone literally throughout the whole day. I even emailed and still till this day no response. I finally got in contact with one woman and she gave me some excuse as to why the phones were never answered. I then told her i had filled out the application and was trying to give the enroll deposit. I was told the school was full.... weird that when I came just two weeks prior they said they had all the space available. Mind you I am a South American man of color &amp; of course my child is also of color. Now I kind of see why they weren&apos;t an abundance of &quot;minorities&quot; in their school.

An example is if we are in a school for beauty and barbering I expect nothing more nothing less, the school seems to try to involve themselves in personal lives of students. Further more the teacher does have great intentions for the students and she is amazing BUT the favoritism still does exist. An example is if a barber or stylist brings a Cilent to preform a service they should be TAUGHT not given to a student that is almost done with school and already has the knowledge of the service the principal of the school is clearly a scam artist when given the opportunity and cannot seem to contain his emotions outside of the school which can lead to many dangerous things. Further more this school has been given a one star review due to the fact favoritism will always exist in this school. Favoritism will decrease the performance of the students morals and leadership, in the end leaders who bluntly show favoritism is a trait that they have no respect for the people they work with and or the students this will have a effect on everyone involved which is why I give it a 1 it&apos;s best to treat everyone equally regardless of past , race , sex , gender , love for other human , current life situation etc. if interested in more details on my experience at this school I recommend sitting and observing the class for the first two weeks and decide if these statements are factual\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":4,\"reviewCount\":4}}"]},

I attended Calhoun when they had satellite campuses all over the place. The main campus was (and I guess still is) in Decatur, and yes you had to attend a lot of classes there; however, they also had satellite classrooms on Redstone Arsenal, Huntsville High School and in &quot;THE Mall&quot; - yes where Barnes and Noble is now, only further down the mall - you had to hang a left at the western themed bar and it was on the east side of The Mall where Picadilly used to be. We always joked that if you leaned in closely enough to the cinder walls you could still hear the servers saying &quot;Serve you, Serve you please?!?!?!&quot; :D\\n\\nBecause high school was such a breeze for me and really did not prepare me for college, I started UAH with a whopping 1.0 and yes, academic probation my first semester. I had no idea you could drop a class and really did *not* think the professors meant what they said when they assigned voluminous amounts of reading/coursework with only a day or so to accomplish it, and I paid for it with terrible grades my first semester.\\n\\nEnter Calhoun! Calhoun to the rescue! I took classes all over north Alabama or at least it felt like it with part time college professors and full time ones, too. Anyway, it was still hard work; however the staff were friendlier than UAH, more accommodating to those of us who worked, and had more of a smaller, diverse group of students. I still learned and I learned a LOT at Calhoun!\\n\\nI managed to pull my grades up to graduate with two associates at cum laude and transfer back to UAH to do the same with 1 BA cum laude.\\n\\nThe tip for anyone planning to do a similar approach to getting a degree is to stay in touch with UAH and ensure each class and associated credit *will* transfer from Calhoun to UAH. To me, and I&apos;m sure to any college student, these hours are pretty much worth gold and you don&apos;t want to lose them! Also, don&apos;t be afraid to take any issues where a credit is denied to the Dean (or higher if necessary) to argue your case.

It was a huge disappointment. I decided to move to Leeds for the BA in Popular Music course at LCM, having come from a music college in London. First of all, offering no class in music theory and harmony is rather an odd thing for a specialist music institution. My first guitar workshop was held in the basement of a pub across the street?! And that workshop, for 1st year students, were to teach us how to recognise notes on the fretboards while they were expected to have at least grade 8 in their playing skill, but can&apos;t recognise what notes they&apos;re playing on the fretboard??!! I had 3 days of school per week, only 3 hours out of those 20, I get to use my guitar at school. For the first couple of weeks, the task for the weekly band practice session was just to come up with random riffs which the supervisors don&apos;t even care, and then go home without even remembering a bit of it. Tutors are inexperienced. One of the guys I had didn&apos;t seem to know much more than I do. 1-to-1 lessons are completely directionless with no specific curriculum. To make it short, I did not get what I expected, I did not get to learn any theory and harmony, I didn&apos;t get to improve my sight reading skill, I didn&apos;t get to practically learn to play the guitar, I didn&apos;t get to improve my aural &amp; transcribing skills, etc. All you&apos;d get there is endless boring lecture about different songs, how to analyse songs by listening to them, and how to successfully make money in the music industry, which the assignments are all about. Nothing is specifically designed for your chosen instrument except for the workshop and the 1-to-1 lesson which takes up no more than 15% of the hours each week.  \\n\\nSo I ended up quitting within the first 3 weeks. I have heard disturbing rumours that they had seriously dire money problems, and I could clearly see for myself, upon enrolment, that they had certain policies that are set up to rip students off. It&apos;s a common thing for universities in the UK to charge non-EU students a higher tuition fee than that EU students have to pay. So when filling out my personal details on the enrolment form, I told them that I was holding dual citizenship, and then they insisted on the fact that I have to pay higher tuition fee because one of the citizenships I was holding is non-EU, despite the fact that I do have British citizenship and grew up here. I ended up having to pay almost two grants more than the EU fee. And for my case, being considered an &quot;international student&quot;, the school had a policy for such students that they are required to pay 75% of one-year tuition fee before enrolment and there would be a no-refund policy applied if they decided to withdraw. With that no-refund policy, they obviously want to rip you off by demanding that much money before enrolling you just to make sure they could still keep a large amount of money and wouldn&apos;t lose a lot if you decided to withdraw. I was so determined and certain that it was definitely the right uni for me, so I decided to pay the fee in full upon enrolment instead of just 75% as required. \\n\\nSo they wouldn&apos;t give me a refund for those stupid reasons. They made that decision of not giving me a refund a couple of days after I handed in the withdrawal form. I was so angry and frustrated. I thought I had no choice but have to continue with the course, so I asked them to disregard the withdrawal request but then they said they&apos;d just enroll someone on their waiting list so they had no more space for me to come back then, wtf??!!!\\n\\nAt the end, I tried to negotiate and only managed to get back 50% of what I&apos;d paid, and they called that &quot;a gesture of goodwill&quot;??!! What really pissed me off was that the head of school even said to me that it was a very &quot;unfortunate&quot; thing that I paid the full tuition fee upon enrolment while I was only required to pay 75% so that&apos;s why I would lose the entire amount. So does that mean THEY are the ones who&apos;re in the &quot;fortunate&quot; situation?! Yeah, that&apos;s right, I lost over 5000 pounds to them for nothing!! \\n\\nTheir money problem can be easily seen by looking at the way they try to cramp too many students in this school. All the seminar-type classes I was in never had enough chairs.\\n\\nAgain, to make it short, I would not recommend this school at all, absolutely not!! I can&apos;t speak for the entire school, but at least for the BA course in Popular Music, just don&apos;t!!! It&apos;s completely crap, just stay home and spend about 1 to 2 hours of practice by yourself every day then after 3 years you&apos;d be way more better than those graduates from LCM. And I mean it, I seriously mean it, it&apos;s not an exaggeration.

We were wasting our lesson time, he said. He then compared our meeting to a ride on Disneyland while patronizingly refuting he wouldn&apos;t &quot;argue with a teenager&quot; when I attempted to clarify the contract.

This includes a discount for 10% if payment is not electronic (Visa, Mastercard, etc). Additionally, there is 18$ worth of discounts for three lessons. The discounts are as follows.\\n\\nIn section 2.2 of the agreement, it is stated: &quot;A price reduction of four dollars ($3) per lesson ($9 total) for scheduling three WEEKDAY lessons (lesson one and two more) by 7pm the night prior to lesson two and prepaying all three WEEKDAY lessons not later than the start of lesson two.&quot; And section 3A reads: &quot;Prepay for three scheduled lessons, do not miss any and receive a $9 rebate at the start of lesson three.&quot; \\n\\nWhen he only mentioned the rebate and the 10% reduction, I attempted to bring up the other $9 discount. This is when he began to get upset and attempted to deflect by saying we were wasting our lesson time. \\n\\nKeep in mind he charges $155 (without discounts) for 70 minute lessons. Compare to lessons in more populated cities where they will charge $300 for FIVE (5) 90 minute behind-the-wheel driving lessons. \\n\\nI had come with my mother and we both left in horrified awe, astounded by the lack of professionalism and lack of basic manners. \\n\\nSave yourself the trouble and do not waste your time.

To start, we had to enroll very suddenly when we moved from Boca Raton to Palm Beach Gardens, and there was basically one spot left at the school for her age.  I placed a deposit a few months before our move, and the school worked with me to make sure I would have no problems having my daughter start mid-month.  The teachers were very welcoming and made sure she felt comfortable in her first week.  We liked that Miss Udeshika (sp?) is involved in most of the day-to-day, because she is never out of the loop.  Miss Mary-Beth is also fantastic, and I never feel uncomfortable asking them questions or making any requests.  Additionally, our daughter LOVES her teachers, to the point where I don&apos;t have to feel bad leaving her in the morning when I see how sweet they are to her (big hugs and kisses each morning).  She&apos;s attached at the hip to Miss Kristen in the Preschool class. I love knowing she&apos;s happy there.\"},{\"author\":\"Stephanie M.\",\"datePublished\":\"2017-04-06\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"The Learning Experience in Palm Beach Gardens is one of the best things that&apos;s happened for our family! Udeshika (the owner) is the baby whisperer! She is such an incredible person and truly cares about her business and every single child who attends her TLE! She makes my son feel special and safe and that is the MOST important thing. I was so worried about going back to work and having to be away from my son, but he is thriving there! When I pick him up he is all smiles and sometimes doesn&apos;t want to leave! All the teachers are fantastic and they all know my son&apos;s name (even teachers of different classes, which might not seem like a big deal but it is to me because I know how many children there are to keep track of!). They give him special attention when warranted like if he&apos;s not feeling well and always keep me in the loop. I feel at ease dropping him off every morning because I know he&apos;s getting the best care! There are a lot of TLE&apos;s but I feel so lucky because this is the best one by far!

Poor costumer service, poor management, unprofessional and disorganized. Shame, it looked like a great school and I was looking forward to enroll my kids here. Moving from another state and not having the chance to visit a place is already disheartening, but this place showed us even more lack of consideration and that they do not need our business.

Now that he&apos;s few months into it, i feel I can truly review the center. Center is located behind the church (not affiliated with church) and has a huge fenced outdoor play area away from the road, has a big indoor run-and-play area too (great for active kids!). It is run by women! (Literally except owner&apos;s dad and sometimes cook I saw no other men here - hooray to women power!). It has personality that I wouldn&apos;t change for any other daycare. Everybody are caring, and nice and very personal. A classroom would usually have 2 main teachers, but you may end up dropping off your kid with another teacher if it&apos;s early in the morning, until there is enough kids to split them (I am not talking infant with toddlers, but like 2 toddlers groups may be merged until 8 or 8:30 am and then separated), which I kind of like because if something happens to my son&apos;s main teacher he is already familiar with any other potential substitute. All teachers (owner too) know all kids names (literally all in the center, not only their own group) and everybody feels like family. It feels more like I am dropping off my kid to some aunts than daycare. Our son is small so I can&apos;t say for certain whether he&apos;s learning much but he definitely is, he comes every now and then with a new word, learned shape, color, or habit. He&apos;s making new friends, and whenever something out of the ordinary happens (he gets a fever or gets hurt), someone from the center calls us immediately and/or sends pictures and details. As a cherry on top, center is very diverse, in teachers and kids. Our son is bi-racial and that is something that was very important to us, for him to grow up in diversity. He&apos;s happy and sometimes when I pick him up he doesn&apos;t run to me straight but shows me some friend, or stuff/toys around the classroom, which tells me that he&apos;s comfortable and likes it there.\"},{\"author\":\"Annie C.\",\"datePublished\":\"2018-02-13\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"Little Explorers is amazing.

They helped to prepare and make sure that my older daughter was beyond ready for kindergarten, which she began in Sept of 2018 and she was ahead of many of her peers in many different aspects and I have Little Explorers to thank for that. I&apos;ve never felt so comfortable or so trusting of anyone watching my children as I do with the Little Explorers team. They treat every child as if it&apos;s their own and all of the kids absolutely adore them. The school itself is clean and they have many different classrooms for different ages. They prepare all different kinds of food for breakfast, lunch and snack on sight for the kids and I can honestly say my kids loved the foods they make, even being picky eaters! There&apos;s always fun projects that they do in relation to the theme of the month involving art, cooking, games, etc. They make learning fun in a way where the kids stay interested and still learn so many different things in the process.

I have been taking my kids there for 3 years and they love it. My first born started as a baby, and my other child started at 6 weeks old. The staff is incredibly helpful and takes the time to get to know each child and their needs. I get a hand written report daily that lets me know what times their diapers were changed, how long they napped, and what they ate. Sometimes when I come to pick my kids up they don&apos;t even want to leave because they are too busy playing with the other kids and the teachers. They have excellent playing areas. The &quot;big kid&quot; playground has plenty of jungle gyms, swings, bikes, etc. as well as a lot of grass for them to run around and play tag. The teachers are always out there playing with them games such as duck duck goose, and red rover. The little kid playground has lots of smaller toys for the toddlers and the teachers are always pushing the babies in the swings. The meals are included in your tuition and my son always talks about how good the food is. He especially loves when they have corn dog nuggets. The center even has a K-4 program that my son will be starting next year that I am so excited for. Overall, I have seen a huge difference in my children compared to other peoples children who do not go to Kid Plus. My children are far more advanced due to the hardwork and dedication the teachers put into each child. They don&apos;t just sit them down in front of a TV or send them to the playground to do whatever they want. Every day is structured with a schedule which helps us out at home because my son has a routine, which helps his behavior out a lot. The teachers always do crafts as well, my fridge is covered in a million different pictures my kids have done over the years. They always bring home sweet little poems with handprints for mothers/fathers day. The teachers also try to have parties for the different holidays and nothing makes my kids happier than bringing cupcakes to school and getting to share them with their friends. I would reccommend Kid Plus to every parent out there. I could not imagine having a better day care facility to take my kids to. In fact, I will be sad when my oldest has to leave day care to go to the elementary school. I will probably leave him in their after school program so I can pick up both my children at once.\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":3.5,\"reviewCount\":3}}"]},

My 7 year old daughter sat in the front with him she was so excited it was her first time flying and it was a surprise birthday present for her. I&apos;ve went on a helicopter ride down here a few years ago and it was great the guy talked to us the whole time asked where we were staying so we could fly by and wave I&apos;ll be taking her there if we ever want to go again. When we got done she was like why didn&apos;t he say hi how are you or bye have a nice day i hope you enjoyed it when we got out that was awkward. i asked which way we were going and he told me left down the beach and across state park and thats the only thing he ever said. The lady that walks you to the helicopter was super nice and friendly.

I was very disappointed and have noticed a pattern they tend to make. Telling parents to come pick up their child cause they are sick when in fact they are not, gives them 2 days automatically out of the week to not have to care for your child. After Making weekly doctor visits and paying a copay amount each visit, just to give an excuse to the daycare to prove your child is not sick will start to add up and also cause a strain at work.

Small workbench and 2 stools to sit on during demo with a spot in the corner to hang your coat. Plenty of space to work in.\\n-During creation, you will be standing in front of the blow torch. I don&apos;t think you&apos;re allowed to sit, due to safety: proximity to the fire and gasses.\\n-One stop shop for some people. Curious place for those new to functional glass art.\\n-Small private class for 2, special request for bigger groups. Good idea for a date night, everyone walks away with something cool!\\n-During introductions, Adrian showed us a tray of the things we could make (pendants, stir sticks, ornaments) to showcase beginner class techniques we would learn.\\n\\nCons:\\n-Location is a little bit hidden, the shop is in the basement of the white house looking establishment NEXT to State Street Brats on N. Frances St. watch for the small street sign next to the sidewalk.\\n-The CBD Store has a lot of locked displays on the floor, so it can get pretty cramped in there.\\n-Originally made our reservation online, the site said it was confirmed but I never got the email confirmation. I had to email them to verify the reservation (48hr response), by the time they replied my chosen time was booked by someone else so the shop gave me the next available time slot which, luckily, turned out to be a better option for us. But still, when you register online take a screen shot of the preliminary confirmation page before you exit the page, then double check your inbox for the confirmation email. There are penalties for cancelled reservations and no shows, read the MGA policies.\\n-No restrooms in the shop. If you need it, go to State Street Brats: use the closest entrance from MGA, go through the door on the left, and the ladies&apos; room will be immediately on the left.\"},{\"author\":\"Emily W.\",\"datePublished\":\"2018-03-11\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"Extremely friendly staff, and very informative.

There are a variety of professors, classes and times / dates available for all types of students. The campus is beautiful. The pool is nice m, clean, big, and heated! They have a clean gym providing different classes as well. There is a lot of parking if you don&apos;t mind walking but they could benefit from a parking structure. I&apos;ve been here for 2 years and I don&apos;t know where most of the offices are; such as security , nurses station, and barely the administration office. Its extremely hard to talk to anyone in the office and I&apos;ve been redirected as well as misdirected several times. Plan to plan ahead and make an appointment with all of your questions so you don&apos;t have to come back. My first couple semesters here I talked to different counselors who gave me completely different advice on what classes I needed etc. Needless to say quite frustrating and did hold me back from being able to apply to a certain college prior the deadline. The school has a great fire academy and EMS program. They have beautiful hiking trails all around the campus for beginners as well as experts with well labeled and paved trails. The library is big and provides the tools necessary. The tutoring center is often a hit and miss. Sometimes the group sessions are helpful , other times they are not. I&apos;ve also done one on one tutoring and would have to say it just depends on the person selected and once you find someone you like, matching their availability. A friend has experienced multiple tutors being late or not showing up at all for scheduled appointments. There is a lot of construction on campus that seems never ending and always ongoing which effects parking and walking. The hold many activities on campus during the week and hold marathons as well as the festivals on the weekend giving plenty opportunities to be involved. The campus also provides a student kept Garden and provides a program where any student without explanation or reason can go get fresh food, snacks, and a drink for no cost. There&apos;s a Queen Bee Cafe which offers a variety of hot/cold foods and drinks! Right next to it is the student store, again having just about everything one might need.

The professors here have a lazy approach and poor attitude towards students and administration is even worse. Students must work extra hard at teaching themselves due to the poor teaching skills these professor. I recommend saving time by taking classes online if you choose to attend classes here. By doing so you will be saving time and gas by not having to actually attend a class because the professors here are really not worth your time. I found myself being more confused when attending class than when I was at home or in study lab, reading, studying myself or with tutors. The teachers here truly are lazy or just carry bad interpersonal skills. I feel the tutors deserve the income the professors receive because tutors actually teach and help students learn. The professors here are getting paid to show up. The regulations here are also slightly twisted and the student panel are incompetent at making the common sense choices or decisions, which could help the progression of a students education in a more accelerated pace. This college creates unnecessary prerequisites that other community colleges do not require in a attempt to keep students enrolled couple semesters longer, which in the end is for their own capital gain. There are many politics students dont care or understand but these poor teachings are keeping these lower income students at community colleges longer rather than moving them quickly to a university in order to finish education. Financial aide and Administration here are also mis managed. My paperwork has gotten mixed up multiple times, costing me money! Its insane how mistakes like this happen, making students victims rather than successful graduates. If there is anyway to avoid community college take it. Even with all the financial aid, coming here will waste your time.\"},{\"author\":\"Hannah R.\",\"datePublished\":\"2015-10-01\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":3},\"description\":\"&quot;Let me put you on hold&quot; is code for &quot;I have no idea but I&apos;m gonna try and get rid of you&quot;\"},{\"author\":\"Brenda W.\",\"datePublished\":\"2018-09-24\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":1},\"description\":\"Horrible, horrible experience.

There are numerous teachers there that are extremely transphobic and uncaring including students as well who have outed me where it brought bullying from other students. If you try to confide in someone - watch out for the dance people there. Desyah - a student there had no care for my life what so ever when I confided in this person about feeling extremely depressed due to bullying and personal family issues in which this person was treating me differently as well for being trans. I ended up saying how uncomfortable it all made me feel as this student had a very &quot;oh well ok then we will be replacing you in the dance show&quot;. and was driving me into a deeper depression and isolation.. as time went on I made the fatal mistake of telling this student that I would tell the school how inappropriate it was all handled a week later - (ironically near trans day of remembrance). I had no idea what hell would be in store for me next as I was clearly retaliated on by this student.. as I  was to be placed in a mental hospital a WEEK LATER after mentioning feeling suicidal. I was pulled out of my class and handcuffed even after explaining to campus police. Obviously I would be a little upset. I was treated as if I was a criminal for being bullied and harassed instead. After being put within the mental hospital which was a traumatic experience in and of itself - I was made fun of by staff and treated horribly for being transgender. The campus police who escorted me tried to comfort me but she also lied and was very misleading while also telling me I must not love myself if I feel suicidal. Something that I felt extremely inappropriate to tell anyone. When telling the school about all this afterwards - the dean of student services Joe Cabrales mentioned in retort to me telling my story &quot;I got up early for this..&quot; at our meeting on me trying to find ways to making crafton a more LGBT friendly place and which he and also Rebeccah Warren-Marlott proceeded to tell me &quot;maybe you should just leave&quot; and that is where I&apos;m at. Humiliated and degraded and never wanting to place foot on this unwelcoming campus again. Numerous students have shared with me also their sadness and the apathy this school shares towards making complaints on this student Desyah and her unwelcoming behavior - to transphobia to slut shaming other people it&apos;s a mess if you ever step into their sad excuse for a dance program. It&apos;s funny because that person isn&apos;t even an enrolled student - as I was actually paying and enrolled to be there. So much unnecessary pain and drama with this place and extremely misguided and uncaring staff. You&apos;ve got some students who will physically harm and bully you for being trans and out you so beware because the school won&apos;t give a rip. I did not feel suicidal a week later during my class - but if you&apos;re a minority and people don&apos;t agree with your lifestyle ..be prepared to be discriminated against. Some of the teachers are just as rude.. confiding in Snezana Petrovic about feeling suicidal? You&apos;ll get nothing - not even a direction to help. She has made so many transphobic and cissexist comments as well as Colleen Maloney Hinds - who also apparently commissions students for drawing sexual imagery for her.. she literally told a student who outed me to draw her porn. I wish I could be making this shit up. Also wanna be made fun of and extremely rudely and sexually inappropriately talked to? Go chat with Mike Bedoya - he&apos;ll appall all your senses. The school doesn&apos;t give a shit - until a student is dead on their watch it seems to be the only case things would actually matter and change. I didn&apos;t find any truly helpful resources given to me by staff. I was just simply told &quot;well.. your karate class was just an elective.. maybe you should leave...&quot; amongst other atrocious gaslighting commentary and so I felt I had to. Some teachers have been kind to me I will say but they retired and said it was everything to get out of this school alive. I will never step foot on this extremely transphobic campus ever again. :) Good riddance to you all. Learn compassion and respect please and I can assure you will change the world.

This review is of the Irwin location....and is long past due!\\n\\nMy sister-in-law has been wanting to try one of these painting classes and I saw that they had just opened a new place in Irwin. So, we decided to check it out. The class was on a Friday night in June and was supposed to be from 7-9pm.\\n\\nThe class was nearly full....since there were several small groups of ladies, as well as a bridal party of about 10. Luckily, we got there before most people and were able to get seats up front. This is a BYOB event, and it appeared mostly everyone (including us) brought a bottle of wine (or several) and snacks. \\n\\nThe instructor was very nice. At the beginning, she gave us her credentials so we knew she was an actual painter with experience and not just someone they pulled off the street. She reviewed what we were going to paint and went at a nice pace. Actually, probably a little slow for me but it&apos;s better than her rushing through. She also gave us free reign and &quot;artistic liberties&quot;, so the paintings didn&apos;t all have to look exactly alike. \\n\\nIt was a fun event and I would love to go again. Biggest pro...the class was only $20! And I&apos;ve seen other places as high as $35 or $40. \\n\\nThe only reason I didn&apos;t give this event 5 stars is the following: It was waaayyy too long. Supposed to be over at 9pm; we didn&apos;t leave until well after 10:30. The biggest cause for this was when we got there at around ten minutes til seven, the instructor was just starting to set up. She did state that she had everything set up, but then a last-minute birthday party booked, so they had torn all of her things down, and she had to get them all back out. Not very professional of the company. We didn&apos;t really get started until about 7:35-ish. Plus, with a big class and people asking her questions, I think it just took longer than anticipated.\\n\\nAlso, it was a bit unorganized, which I do give leniency to since it&apos;s a new gig. I signed the two of us up online and also paid online. But, really, how was the instructor to know? We could have just strolled in from the street and said we paid. The site offered no receipt or confirmation number to take with you to the event. I asked the instructor if she received our payment, and she stated that she gets paid from the company, and frankly has no idea who paid and who didn&apos;t. \\n\\nOverall, a fun night out.

My sons pediatrician kindly reassured me, and reminded me some people like to give their opinions, even when it&apos;s not needed.

Woodlawn, Henley and Powell were known as the oldest white public schools in Birmingham, the others having been built after 1900.Actually, the school that occupied the site of the old Powell School that burned yesterday, was called The Free White School, and a picture of it appears in another article featured in the Birmingham City Archives&apos; digital collection. \\n\\nHISTORICAL MARKER READS:\\nBirmingham&apos;s first public school was named for Colonel James R. Powell, the city&apos;s first elected Mayor. This energetic promoter also served as the first President of the Elyton Land Company (now Birmingham Realty). which founded the city in 1871. Two years later, Colonel John T. Terry led the fund raising to establish a &quot;free school for white children.&quot; The school was &quot;free&quot; only of ties to a religious institution for fees were charged according to grade level. Mayor Powell donated his salary, police court fines and other city fees to support the school.\\nThe present red brick Victorian Gothic style structure, designed by S. J. Hall of Cleveland, Ohio in 1888, is the third Powell School. Until 1918, the school accommodated grades one through twelve and for a time served as a training school for prospective teachers\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":5,\"reviewCount\":1}}"]},

It is co-located with a library that is only accesible to Troy students. They have metered street parking right out front and within a reasonable walking distance.\\n\\nThe site of the museum is significant because it is where Rosa Parks was arrested on a bus for not giving up her seat. It has a historical marker out front marking the location. It has a neat sculpture outside that can only be viewed directly, any other angles and you are looking at some posts in the group.  There is also a very nice sculpture of Ms. Parks sitting alone in her seat on the bus. It makes for great photos.\\n\\nThe museum is small and offers self guided tours. There are no pictures allowed in the main exhibit area. The tour begins in a small room with benches around it. You watch a movie about segregation in Montgomery, the bus system and the boycott. Once the movie is over, some doors open and leads you to the next area. The next area is a pretty neat reenactment of Rosa Parks being arrested on the bus. You view the action as if you are viewing it from outside of the bus. It is very nice and really makes you feel like you are in the action. \\n\\n After the reenactment on the bus, some doors open up to a gallery that has exhibits, videos, artifacts, and pictures. You move at your own pace from this spot until the end of the tour. You will see a replica carpool vehicle over there, you will also hear stories told by people that were there during that time via videos and you will see a display of leaders riding the bus after the boycott ended. They give you the option of using your phone for an audio tour in a few sections of the museum. It provides you some information about what you are looking at. I did not use it because it seemed like more effort than what it was worth to me. Some type of push button audio kiosk would be perfect in its place. Anyway, as i mentioned, the exhibit area is not a very big area. We went through it in about 15 minutes.. The entire tour took us about 30 minutes. Even though thee is not a lot to it, it was still a nice visit and I  learned a bit. It does a good job making you feel as if you are back during that time.\\n\\nNo museum would be complete without a gift shop, this one is no exception. They have a small gift shop where you not only purchase you museum admission, but you can buy souvenirs like shirts or bags.\\n\\nAll-in-all this a decent museum. I love that it is located on the historical site where the bus incident occurred. It is small, but still makes a great impact. It&apos; is definitely worth a visit if you are in downtown Montgomery. I would recommend checking out some of the other nearby museums, like the Legacy Museum and Civil Rights Center to maximize your trip.\"},{\"author\":\"Penny S.\",\"datePublished\":\"2022-04-18\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"This museum is two parts - our family of five just did the museum experience.

On the second floor is a photo timeline of Civil Rights events and informational columns highlighting the important faces of the movement and their story.\\n\\nBack in the main building is a gift shop, exhibition art hall and a self guided tour highlighting the famous story of Rosa Louise McCauley Parks and her defiance to give up her seat on that faithful day. What I never knew about the history of this event was that it wasn&apos;t altogether random. Rosa Parks planned to do this with the help of other civil rights leaders so they could use it as a launching point for a federal case against the unconstitutional segregation laws in Alabama. It was only an idea, but Rosa fulfilled it when she found the opportunity, because it couldn&apos;t be staged. That takes nothing away from Rosa Parks. The danger of such defiance was deadly real, as witnessed by the Freedom Riders in the same era.\\n\\nOddly, the case was not brought to court using Rosa. Instead they used the first person to actually defy the bus laws, young Claudette Colvin, whom was 15 and pregnant at the age of her arrest. Her arrest happened on March 2nd, 1955, a full 9 months before Rosa&apos;s arrest on December 1, 1955.\\n\\nThe story is told using a full sized model of a Montgomery bus as you stand outside of the bus looking through the windows (which utilize TV screens). The bus is set in a room that looks like a small movie set with buildings, a faux street and streetlights. Here is a link to a Youtube video of this exhibit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h82ajl69iy0\\n\\nOVERALL it is a great experience, especially when coupled with the other Civil Rights museums in the downtown area. Not far away from the RP Library the City of Montgomery is working to construct a park and monument @ the site of the famous bus stop where Rosa boarded. Not sure when it will be ready as digging was underway during our May 2019 visit. The Library is actually the location of the arrest. Both the Time Machine exhibit in the Children&apos;s Annex and the Bus Arrest exhibit in the main building are must see&apos;s when visiting Montgomery Alabama and the Freedom Trail.

Inside a big room sat an over-sized replica of a bus surrounded by used computer parts and lights that were intended to make the place look like you were traveling back in time. I don&apos;t know if I would have called it creepy - but with him being the only person in the room, I can see why he wanted me to hurry up and get there so they could start. That&apos;s right.. it was just the two of us along for the trip through time.\\n\\nThe feature started and Mr. Rivetts, our &quot;bus driver&quot; (which looked like the robot from the movie Short Circuit) took us on a trip through time starting in Cincinnati meeting a young boy named Jim Crow and ended up in the 1950&apos;s after being introduced to Mrs Parks. While definitely geared towards children, it was worthwhile to go through. There were TV&apos;s throughout the entire room and the walls became projection screens, so even if the room was packed with students on a field trip, everyone would be able to see.\\n\\nAfter going through the Children&apos;s part, our admission also got us into the 1955 and beyond part of the exhibit. A much smaller room was waiting on us with very few seats, but we sat down and watched interviews on three projectors and learned more about Rosa Parks specifically. After about 15 minutes of watching this, the automatic doors opened and we were outside on a street corner in 1955 watching and listening on the city bus when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat. \\n\\nThe rest of the tour was a self-guided walking tour of the bus boycott, church meetings, police reports and historic memorabilia.

After a trip to the Civil Rights Museum, we stopped by here.  Without a doubt, the Rosa Parks tour features the most interactive and engaging setup that I have ever seen.  After passing the ticket gate, visitors are invited to watch an opening video on a three-panel television display mounted high above.  Given that we were a large group, seating was insufficient, but we didn&apos;t seem to take issue with plopping down on the floor.  In retrospect, it gave the video a drive-in sort of feel.\\n\\nThe next stop was an audiovisual tour of the Montgomery bus boycott.  A facsimile of the bus appeared against a wall.  Audio recordings simulated Ms. Park&apos;s refusal to vacate her seat; though Rosa&apos;s voice actor&apos;s speech was a bit slow, I appreciated the accompanying voices&apos; authenticity until the moment of her arrest.  This part of the museum was very dark, so I would urge visitors to be careful navigating this space.  The doors opened to reveal a walking exhibit of the planning and aftermath of the bus boycott.  The guide continued to walk among the exhibits and ushered us through them.  When we got to the end of the walk, double doors featured an audio recording of a MLK sermon; at its end, visitors were invited to walk through them, simulating a church revival service.  The tour ended shortly thereafter.\\n\\nI think the only thing I have to recommend is being told what else is in this building.  I suppose it worked out well since we had additional stops planned.

We traveled to  Birmingham and Auburn researching schools and neighborhoods. After a number of area visits, meetings with real estate agents and tours of homes, nothing seemed to fit.  So at one point  we looked upward and ask God, &quot;this isn&apos;t working out, do you have other plans&quot;?\\n\\nHe then began to unveil His plan. That was to look at private schools in the Montgomery area. The cost would be significant, however, after running the numbers, we realized the cost of moving coupled with the premium for housing, we would actually save money over five years. \\n\\nWe began to reach out to private schools and narrowed our search to two. One a Christian school and the other, Saint James, a secular school. We then began communications with the admission office. \\nThey were amazing. Their processing of new applicants was as well orchestrated and professional as one could have imagined. \\nNext came the course selection process. Once again, this team was very engaged in guiding us along as we chose the academic course levels and electives. \\n\u00a0\\nDuring the open house event, we heard from the head of school, Dr. McLemore, and the middle school principal Dr. Taylor. They deftly handled the power outage that evening and carried on without the use of lights or PowerPoint. They didn&apos;t miss a beat. The handout materials they provided during that meeting were well thought out and very useful. \\n\\nFinally, after meeting with each of the teachers, we gained so much confidence that God had led us to the right school. We had scoured Birmingham and Auburn in our quest to find the right culture and environment best suited to prepare our son for college and life. As it turned out, that school was Saint James. \\n\\nEveryone we have met has been so helpful, communicative, responsive, and professional. Even the parking lot attendant is a great guy! \\nThe consistency, professionalism, courtesy, communications and passion to the education, emotional and psychological well being of our children has been such a constant theme throughout our Saint James experience. \\n\\nWhile we initially had some reservations over choosing a secular college preparatory school over a Christian school, as it turned out, Saint James is staffed with teachers and administrators who lives are marked by Christ. While Saint James doesn&apos;t have required Bible study or verses displayed on their marketing materials or on the school walls, it&apos;s clear the presence of the Holy Spirit is in this place.\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":5,\"reviewCount\":1}}"]},

We couldn&apos;t be happier with our experience with Brooklyn Learning!\"},{\"author\":\"Kristi S.\",\"datePublished\":\"2011-09-30\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"My son has been working with Ms. Jo-Ann Kalb over the last year and in that time we have seen incredible growth in his academic work and his confidence as a reader and writer.  Ms. Kalb has a clear and supportive way of working that my son responds to. I know this because we have tried another tutor in the past and it did not go well.  I also know that Ms. Kalb has been taking workshops in order to have an additional specialization in the Orton-Gillingham Method of instruction.  We appreciate the time Ms. Kalb has taken to discuss my son&apos;s learning issues.  Although he has undergone a series of tests with an Educational Psychologist, Ms. Kalb has given us insight to his learning issues that we did not get from this extensive testing.   We have the highest recommendation for Ms. Kalb.\"},{\"author\":\"Jennifer M.\",\"datePublished\":\"2011-11-04\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"I HIGHLY recommend Craig Selinger as a speech therapist. He has worked with my son Ethan for nearly 18 months now and has helped Ethan make amazing progress - in speech, joint attention, social skills and much more. Craig has also been an invaluable resource to our family in researching and recommending various types of therapies for Ethan&apos;s specific needs. He answers all of my questions and takes the time to explain everything he is working on with Ethan. He is punctual, professional and - most importantly - my son loves him. He runs to the door to greet him and talks about the session after he leaves. We were so lucky to find Craig when we were researching therapists. We highly recommend him!\"},{\"author\":\"Margaret L.\",\"datePublished\":\"2012-03-18\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"I highly recommend Suzanne Kipervaser as a speech therapist.  My daughter is very sensitive and prone to anxiety; Suzanne was both in tune with Rose&apos;s emotions, and skilled at keeping the sessions focused.  To me this is no small feat with a 3 year old.\\n Suzanne always came prepared with a game to play, a project (such as arts and crafts, cooking) or a book, or a combination of these activities.  She worked with Rose on a variety of language issues, as well as making choices, taking turns, listening.  She used a visual (picture) schedule each time which seemed to help Rose feel more organized and in control.  This was before Rose was in school, and it was with Suzanne that Rose learned to &quot;read&quot; a schedule.\\n In addition, Suzanne was exceptional at communicating with us as parents.  She actually listened to our concerns, and addressed them head on.  We have had our share of therapists, and have found that this is not something you can take for granted.\\n Suzanne is attentive, sympathetic, and dedicated, fun, kind, and knowledgeable.  \\nShe challenges the child at the right level---not too easy, not too hard.  I highly, highly recommend Suzanne.\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":5,\"reviewCount\":16}}"]},
