Last week I had to take a day off because she had contracted pink eye. Now today I was phoned at work to find out she had &quot;tripped&quot; and she has 2 chipped teeth. I chose a center over a private home for safety issues and this is NOT what I paid extra for! Her clothes are always stained, she&apos;s always very hungry when she is picked up and I&apos;ve had to call into work 3 times now, add that to what I&apos;ve spent in Dr&apos;s visits and medication...",

NO - The last month we paid for, my child never even went - Now I get it we paid for that month so I didn&apos;t expect anything back - However, we were then charged for another month because we didn&apos;t give written notice - On top of that, we were never notified of the charge and they sent us to collections 6 months later - When I called them I was told that it wasnt their problem and they called us - I would NEVER recommend you take your child to this establishment",

From elementary to high school, I was able to soar in education  (AP Calculus, AP Chemistry, SAT, ACT, etc) with the help of Dr. Park&apos;s Academy. In my senior year of high school, I received tremendous help applying to college (Northwestern University, which I will attend this upcoming fall) was difficult but made easier with the help of Dr. Park.\\nThe SAT prep helped me achieve a score of 1530 and a  34 in ACT. Furthermore, I was able to participate in group study sessions and private sessions that helped me tremendously in all subjects. Without the help of Dr. Park, taking numerous AP classes in addition to participating in sports and other after-school activities, all while maintaining a good academic performance would not have been possible. Overall, the academy greatly helped me stay on schedule with school (all throughout high school!), test prep (ACT, SAT, other school tests), applying to colleges, and scholarships.",

Despite helping you with SATs, they also were able to help me and give me ideas on how to apply to colleges. The academy wants to help you get into the college that you want to get into and truly care for your education. \\n\\nAlthough I did not end up attending my top choice colleges due to their high tuition fees and not enough scholarships, I was able to get a very good financial aid packet at Creighton University with a 2-4 Pharmacy program which allowed me to be closer to my goals of going to Pharmacy School. \\n\\nI truly recommend this company. Without their SAT prep class, I don&apos;t think I would&apos;ve been able to get into the college of my choice or get a good scholarship. They stress a good education and prepare you to become a successful person inside and outside of school.",

            "description": "I prepped with this company back in the early days before it was a bigger company, and now I tutor here.  It&apos;s great to see growth.  I&apos;m going to give an un-biased report:\\n\\nI scored around a 2300 through prepping here, back when the &quot;new&quot; SAT was new.  I took the SAT once on my own and prepped through 2 more SATs here, and after prepping with them, obtained a perfect score on the Writing.  I also ACT-prepped here twice and got a 34 (out of 36).\\n\\nThe Academy helped plan my academic path early on and naturally, I used their college prep services, and got into Columbia University, University of Chicago, Northwestern, Georgetown, etc (oddly enough, I was waitlisted at University of Washington in St. Louis, though lol).  It came down to Columbia and Northwestern, but I ended up going to NU.\\n\\nOne thing I must emphasize about their college prep program is that it is truly comprehensive.  Like, they help you from A to Z and beyond.  Their philosophy is &quot;Let me help you get your kid into his/her Harvard,&quot; but they don&apos;t stop there.  They aggressively focus on scholarships.  I got a full ride merit-scholarship into Northwestern (whereas, ivy league schools don&apos;t usually give scholarships but are great with financial aid if you need a lot of it).  So, at first, I was a bit sad not to go to Columbia, but in the end and looking back, I was really pleased that I walked out of college debt-free AND got a stellar education.\\n(P.S.- back in the day, Columbia was ranked #9 and Northwestern was #11, so it made little difference ranking-wise where I chose to go.  In 2013, Columbia is at #4).\\n\\nSo, even though I may SOUND biased, I mean, I did walk out with fantastically improved scores, a fantastic college prep package, and got into my absolute top choice schools.  I got results--and not just any, but the ones I wanted.\\nI am not writing this because I work here, or because I was asked to.  I try to be a very honest person in life, and I would never have chosen to work here if I didn&apos;t think their services or philosophy was up to par.  The truth is, I decided to teach here because I agree with the philosophy and practices.  They truly care about education and each student.  I&apos;ve seen the founders help less privileged students by writing off hours and giving them scholarships, and I saw them do this before the company became bigger--usually the time of initial &quot;company growth&quot; is not the time most business people act so generous.  They&apos;re not in it for the money, they&apos;re in it because education makes the world a better place.  Their kids both went to phenomenal undergraduate and graduate programs but are working/will be working in the public service sector.\\n\\nTrust me, and not just because I work here (though, it should encourage you to come, as I did score in the 99% and am one of their best tutors), if you are passionate about your education and being/becoming successful, you want to be here.  There is no other place you&apos;d personally want to be, or send your kid.  I&apos;ll be using their services again for graduate school entrance prep.",

We were two of four people on the excursion and had FAR less photography experience than the other two people on the tour. Our photo guide Eva was incredible, patient, and an amazing teacher. She taught us how to take amazing photos on the phones that we brought. At no point during discussions of lighting, framing, color, and shutter speed did we feel neglected or talked down to, both of which are easy to do when teaching a mix of novices and and experienced amateurs. We came away from the excursion with some of the most amazing photos of our trip and the memory of an incredible end to the best day of our Alaskan vacation. I cannot recommend Denali Photo Guides, and our guide Eva in particular, enough.",

My kindergartener at the time was being heavily bullied at this school. As far as I am aware of this mostly happened during the breaks. The noon duties are too busy chatting, so they are unable to properly supervising our children. I am still a young parent, so I have lots to learn. I didn&apos;t know that elementary kids are that mean.. nor was I sufficiently involved in the whole school thing.. I am too consumed into work and being stresses and tired.. I lost out of sight what really matters. Looking back, that is a huge regret! I thought my son was in a safe place. He was not. Beyond being bullied, he was assaulted more than once. He was pushed off the equipment on the playground and nobody noticed. My son had a concussion. Nobody noticed. The noon duty did not apologize. The principal did reach out... mr Agnaiak is the name, I believe.   When I approached my sons teacher about it, the response was &quot;so, are you saying that the duty was not doing her job?&quot; Shy as I was back then, I said no... but I should have said yes. Yes, your noon duties were not doing their jobs. Or my son would not have suffered on your premises. I&apos;m sorry that I took him to this school. And I&apos;m sorry that I was ignorant, I had no idea that sensitive or shy children get no guidance or protection by teachers and just how mean a lot of our children are. You parents need to spend more time with your children and raise them properly! Your kids are bananas!\\nBut, yes my five year old have a concussion on your premises.. and he was assaulted by a class mate. A student pushed him on he ground, pushed his face into the snow and sat on his head... my son looked sad when I picked him up, so I asked him what was wrong, and that is what he told me. I approached the duty about it and the only thing she said was &quot;I cannot tell you the names of other students m&quot; or something like that. That was not the response I was expecting, so I did not know what to say. My son told me who the child was, so I told the grandmother that was picked the kid up.. the school would have done nothing. They do a sucky job at protecting your kids!!! I should have known when I was signing my sons up and there was a kid in the nurses room because a student had rammed a pencil into his neck.. oh my gosh.. I know you can&apos;t say only bad things about the school.. but a few other things do come to mind. This school needs parent volunteers, the school is sort of out of control of the students.. I don&apos;t know what else the problem would be?   Thinking back makes me sad and angry. I know I did not speak up back then, when I should have. I was not thinking the right way! But I emailed the principal about this two years ago, and I received no response.. shows how much they care..\\nAlso did I mention to the principal that I watched an elder female teacher pull a student around by the shoulder.. I should have said something too when I saw it back then.. I was just young and stupid. I&apos;m sorry I put my son in your hands. Very. An upset parent of a former student.",

            "description": "I wish I could give them 6 stars! Ronn and Marketa were amazing with us. We happened to reserve some really bad weather nights. Rather than taking our money, Ronn called me and was honest that he felt that the weather would not cooperate with seeing the Aurora and canceled our reservation. They were fully booked for the rest of the week with our clients and couldn&apos;t fit us in on any other day. They almost NEVER cancel a reservation because they are professionals that know what they are doing and will drive a hundred miles or more if needed; just in our case, the weather was bad everywhere in the area.\\n\\nI had mentioned that it was my wife&apos;s dream to experience the Aurora and she has stage 4 gastric cancer. He had felt so bad and they were so generous as to let us meet them as their secret place on another night. We extended our stay 2 more nights to hopefully see it. They helped set up my camera (Sony Alpha 6000 with Rokinon 12mm F2.0 Lens) and chatted with us for a few minutes to make sure we knew what we were doing and everything.\\n\\nEven though they canceled our reservation they still took a few portraits of us and helped us fulfill my wife&apos;s dream. She cried as she experienced the aurora saying it was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen, and now I&apos;m tearing up just writing this review for the kindness and generosity of Ronn and Marketa.\\n\\nAll the locals, from the ER nurse at the hospital to restaurant owners and other tour operators, recommend Aurora Chasers. When even the locals recommend them you know they are good. They are top of the line for experiencing the aurora. Even though we never went in it they have a very nice passenger van to accommodate their guests. Also, don&apos;t leave early, stay out late. We were just about to leave when the aurora popped out of nowhere and was the most brilliant dance we&apos;ve ever seen.\\n\\nAttached are the photos they took of us.",

We were aware that the Aurora was weather dependent and we had come at a bad time to see the lights but they made our night special. It was overcast and snowy so we weren&apos;t able to see the lights initially but they took us to an amazing location, we otherwise never would have discovered. We happened to get extremely lucky on the drive back into town and the skies cleared up for us to stop and see the lights. The experience was incredible and it was only because of how amazing they are and their talented photography skills . They were so nice and accommodating and worked really hard to give us a great night. I would highly recommend them! We are definitely going to be coming back.",

            "description": "AMAZING EXPERIENCE!\\nRonn and Marketa are the best! \\nWe were booked through Make A Wish for February 14 from 9PM-3AM.  As soon as it was booked Ronn sent me an extremely detailed email and link to their website in early November-thank goodness. If he hadn&apos;t, we would never have been able to prepare for this once in a lifetime opportunity (we&apos;ll probably go again, but there&apos;s no time like your first time).  \\nTo begin with: DO NOT WEAR COTTON- don&apos;t even bring it to Alaska in winter.  I suggest shopping for winter gear in early to mid November before your trip.  And unless you live somewhere that has bitterly cold winters, you will have to shop online because sunny LA does not stock what we needed in stores.  There are gear rentals in Alaska, but I didn&apos;t want to chance them not having our sizes and I want to do more winter travel so having our own gear will be nice.  Follow Ronn&apos;s list of suggestions &amp; you&apos;ll be warm.\\nIt was between -38 and -8 the week we were in Fairbanks. -42 with the windchill the night we were out for this gorgeous night.   All 3 of us wear eyeglasses: 3 blind mice.  The balaclava was hated by all 3 of us.  Your hot breath shoots straight up and fogs and then frosts you&apos;re lenses.  You won&apos;t be able to see.  If you pull it down and expose your nose, you&apos;ll avoid this, but risk frostbite. Also, once the balaclavas got moist , they stayed moist /wet and added to the cold.  Better option were fleece neck warmers and wool hats (the Peruvian ones are fantastic with flaps for your ears). I found that if I put a hand on my nose, under my glasses I could force my breath out instead of up and maintain vision.  If you know of a better solution let me know.  None of the eyeglass wearing Alaskans were able to give us a solution.\\nBack to the Aurora:  This is a photography class at first.  That being said, once the photography lesson is over (30 minutes max) &amp; those that are shooting have their cameras properly adjusted (Ronn shows you how), everyone is outdoors staring up at the star riddled sky.  Our night was clear.  Those that weren&apos;t shooting we&apos;re doing the same thing as those of us with cameras: marveling at the night sky and waiting for the show to begin.\\nWhen it did, Marketa starts shooting photos of everyone- singles, together, poses, whatever there&apos;s time for during the bursts. Her energy is contagious and unending.  She took us away from the van and off on a snowmobile trail.\\nThe Aurora just kept getting better and better so our night was not a chase. That being said, every night is a crapshoot.  You never know what will happen. Our night didn&apos;t have a great prediction; we thought we were barely going to see it and then it just went crazy! And Marketa took so many awesome photos of us, I couldn&apos;t be more thankful.  It&apos;s nice to capture my own photos, but to have someone to shoot professional photos of all of us together for a change is priceless.   \\nI was only able to see a very light tinge of green with my naked eyes; I mostly saw shades of white and grey.  It might be because of how bad my eyesight is, who knows, but I&apos;m not colorblind.  It&apos;s the science behind how our eyes see in the dark. Ronn explains it. Some people claim that they can see the colors green , red and purple.  I could not.  They of course are visible in the photos because the camera picks up the colors when it&apos;s set correctly. But seeing the Aurora in white and greys was pretty exciting when it dances and covers the sky.  \\nI recommend renting a camera and tripod from Ronn and Marketa if you don&apos;t own one. Even if you don&apos;t shoot on a regular basis, you can do this and it&apos;ll give you something to do other than just standing around staring at the sky.   You can also take photos of the stars without city light pollution.\\nThat being said, neither of my sons shot and they thoroughly enjoyed the experience.\\nWhen Ronn saw my lense, he told Marketa to give me a better one- mine isn&apos;t good enough for shooting night shots.  This is how much they care about giving you the whole experience.  \\nThe night before you&apos;re scheduled you&apos;ll get an email telling you what time they&apos;ll be picking you up in the van.  It&apos;s a nice van, tall enough to stand straight up in, but with everyone dressed like Michelin men, it&apos;s close quarters with 12 passengers.  \\nOnce everyone is picked up from their hotels, off you go! En route Ronn puts on a headset so everyone can hear and he goes over the plan for the evening. There is a big monitor that hangs in front of the passengers and you&apos;ll be able to view the &quot;science &quot; that is being explained as Ronn drives to your first viewing spot (and hopefully your only).  Once you arrive the photography lesson begins and everyone who is shooting makes the adjustments to their cameras.  Might be boring for non photographers, but it goes quickly. Then it&apos;s everyone out of the van as soon as they (Ronn and Marketa ) spot the Aurora.",

Fun to watch the babies with their mommas and learn about how the muskox sheds his undercoat and how the wool is plucked for sweaters, hats, etc. The yarn is luxuriously soft and very expensive but absolutely worth every penny. The gift shop sells all sorts of woolen items and trinkets. \\n\\nLarge viewing area, separate pens and plenty of space to walk around. Enjoy a picnic with a view of the animals (if they&apos;re not at the far end of the pasture). \\n\\nFriendly and knowledgeable guides, loads of parking and easy to find. Worth a visit to learn about the research and care for the animals. I learned that willow is the muskoxens favorite munchie, its packed with copper necessary for their diet.",

The courses are extremely broad and shallow, and they do not provide the skills or knowledge necessary to become competent in your field or to work in the real world. \\n\\nThe administration are awful people who do NOT care about those they should be taking care of. They regularly spout talking points about equality and being good people, but their actions reveal their hypocrisy. It&apos;s truly stomach churning.\\n\\nIf you&apos;re the victim of a crime, the campus police do not care and will do the bare minimum that they can get away with so they can just close the case ASAP. \\n\\nThe museum is a fine place to visit if you&apos;re passing through Fairbanks, but I strongly advise against attending this university.",

In addition there&apos;s a museum that holds information about Aurora lights (Borealis and Australia). Also have info about history of Alaska Pipeljne how it started and how they built 800 miles. Incredible! This university also has dorms and parking is convenient. Many students eager to learn and I love that.",

            "description": "Ahh, this review is solely for the University Bookstore. We made a quick trip up to Fairbanks from Denali National Park to hit up a major supermarket for their Western Union. I wasn&apos;t going to drive all the way to Fairbanks and back to Denali just for a Western Union. I needed to make the gas guzzling trip worth it so I did a quick search for University of Alaska Fairbanks and decided to check out the bookstore. I love books and thought I might be able to pick up some souvenirs here as well. \\n\\nLuckily, I was right! The abundance of items in this bookstore was definitely surprising! There were t-shirts, sweatshirts, notebooks, coffee cups, pint glasses, mittens, scarves, hats, yoga mats... pretty much anything you could ever need AND there was a huge sale going on, making a college bookstore affordable for once! I got two t-shirts and a sweatshirt for myself, a t-shirt for my mom, a t-shirt for my cousin, and a pint glass and it was under $100. They had North Face gloves and scarves discounted at least 40%, too. It was tempting to resist buying more but I did have to consider it was June and I had limited space in my backpack... I wish I could have bought more though!  \\n\\nThe University as a whole was easy to find, well-maintained, and the bookstore signage was prominent. Parking was easy although it should be noted it was June and I&apos;m assuming a lot of students returned home for summer. Driving around the campus heading back down towards Denali was a real treat... We don&apos;t have rock climbing walls, animals, etc. on college campuses in Western New York! I hope to return to Fairbanks someday and I&apos;ll definitely stop at the University while I&apos;m in the area!",

The only thing the university can not help is the mosquitoes and  they bit my head like crazy.  Anyways I was here over an internship during the summer. The campus is smaller, but spacious, but it overlooks a hill. If you go through a bike trail, you there is a pound you can go fishing, but unfortunately I went the whole week and did not catch jack down there.  Hmm they have a nice gym for the students and it was nice. The only problem is they have a weird policy about shoes, you must take them off before entering the gym even if you are warming some. But the staff was pretty rude I thought.\\n\\nAnyways besides that there is no tax which was nice and every Wednesday was $1 ice cream which was cool. Anyways the food wise goes just depends on where you go. I ended up going to this cafe in the science building and getting their special which is a sandwich or spaghetti which was nice.\\n\\nThe campus does have a museum which I was able to visit one time. I really liked it and go to see the behind the scenes part.  But yeah I am usually not into museums much.  Anyways hmm oh yes I did live in the dorm rooms, the huge one out in front. I thought it was not too bad.  I wish I had more of my privacy however because I had a roommate. The kitchen was pretty dirty and well you had to clean the dishes in order to use them to cook.  The residents were friendly though, I made some friends though them.\\n\\nI worked in the ARSC building which was cool, even though it was a 1/2 mile trek there, I had fun. Sometimes when I was lazy, I took the shuttle =) but I figured it was quicker walking.  Taking the bus was not too bad, but we had bikes so we just biked it to Fred Meyer. They did have a Sam&apos;s club, so I took the bus with my luggage and stocked up.",

I did get the chance to see some buildings and classrooms (wild eh?) which were pretty standard and felt like they were built in the late 70s or mid 80s.  There is a nice view of the mountains from the campus... so there is that.  Most interesting thing was seeing the co-eds sunbathing in April... it was about 54 F out.",

While we were there, though, thought it would be nice to explore a bit.  \\n\\nWe wound up having lunch at the food court in the central commons building-- which was pretty dead on a Saturday afternoon.  Most of the shops in the food court were closed, but there the burger joint was open and their two-person team was also staffing the adjacent coffee stand.  The food here was at the low end of &quot;blah&quot;, but that&apos;s just about exactly what we were expecting.  At least it was relatively cheap.\\n\\nThe commons building was pretty neat; reminded me of a big ski lodge.",

            "description": "I would like to praise God for my buddies on the Sopah- Paranormal Investigation Team for investigating my fathers property and my home at 1401.3 Alaska Hwy Delta Junction, AK.  I had taken pictures on my old IPhone 5S while living with my ex husband and caught paranormal activity on camera and Mel responded just like Jesus would, she believed me.....thanks Mel....she responded like a rescue squad with her team and came to help me.  I was being tormented by some evil entity and believe after having victory through much prayer, I believe that entity may be attached to my mother, she is extremely nice an caring to others but has been abusive to me all my life really....I just kept stuffing thinking it was me....I came to Brinnion, WA to get away from my mother and brother, they were making things so difficult for me to survive.  But shortly after my mother came with my brother and I feel so tormented since she has been here....I have been busting my a_ _ helping up keep the yard almost every day I&apos;ve been here and cleaning house (it was a filthy in here in my opinion).  I use to be afraid of heights (just ask my dad), but God gave me victory in that area because mom mentioned the woodshed was leaking and I did notice all the pine needles outside the upstairs window while taking a bath so I got up there and cleaned off what seemed like 1/2 foot of pine needles and branches and later I trimmed the tree that was touching the house.  I have cleaned off the deck a  few times especially after a recent storm and raked so many leaves while taking care of the yard, it looks really nice.  I told my mom she needed to get saved....she claims she does know Christ, but something is very wrong.  Yesterday she was throwing silverware in the kitchen sink (she seemed very irritated ).  I was in God&apos;s word and played God&apos;s hymns before I started my day so I was happy.  She was in the way of putting the peanut butter container away so I calmly slid the peanut butter jar across the counter when she responded out of anger and told me not to throw things, I responded I&apos;m sorry you misunderstood I slid it across the counter I never intended to throw anything then I walked out back into the entryway to continue to play my flute-God&apos;s hymns when it seemed like the devil came out of her....she said may I remind you who&apos;s house this is....I said I know it is your house and I don&apos;t want your house or your money she became more angry when I quoted scripture.... she kicked me out during a storm, I rode my bike over 5 miles one way in much pain from being ill to use the harbor telephone to call my niece Kyla Deisler for help but she said she had not money for gas to come and get me and informed me to call her mother and I responded I refused to ask help from my sister while she lives at a drug house. I found a soft mossy place in the storm...in the National Forest and cried out to God for victory in Jesus and laid down to rest a bit and prayed...My son hasn&apos;t kept his word to me for the basic necessities to survive. I returned to my mothers soaked I got a drink from the hose and sat in a chair on the deck while my mother ate pop corn and was laughing while watching a movie...while I was in the entryway Satan decided to offer me a bath, I said no a bed is all I need.  I said I only need a bed and within her seemed to offer me back in to I don&apos;t want her bike-it is extremely painful for me to use it anymore)  I&apos;m praying someone scores when it&apos;s found.  They haven&apos;t helped since, it&apos;s been some time and I have been struggling...but my son&apos;s too busy for his mother who busted her but raising him...who is this kid?????  And who are these so called co-worker-supervisor who says my son and Primo Seniza told him everything about me ( my son has chose not to be a part of my life when he left Alaska, I rarely heard from him unless I called him....no concern at all for me as his mom.  I pray God makes my son a job offer he can&apos;t refuse that he would love and helps him choose better friends or realizes who his true friends in Alaska are. This is definitely not the son I raised, my son used to always put mom first I loved his hugs)something is very wrong.  They pretty much left it at that and I haven&apos;t seen either one (and she never got up in the middle of the night to discuss with me why I was up-I was sick in pain hurting and praying....but she possible judged me the wrong way as well by believing gossip from others in Mason County.  Anthony said he would help me me with a new cell like he said and with finding me wheels.  I understand people have lives and jobs but I know now this isn&apos;t my family at all...Mountain Movers is and that&apos;s where I choose to spend my every Sunday-I am happy in Jesus there, my family is at Mountain Movers Church not here. help his mother with medical attention for a broken wrist. Thanks for all you do Sopah..God does use even the gift of paranormal experts for His honor and glory.  Thank you Jesus for blessing me with Mel",

            "description": "UAF is a great college especially for alaska. It has been my goal to attend it since my freshman year of high school, and now I&apos;m a freshman at college at UAF. People always ask me why I &quot;settle&quot; for UAF as my college and why I didn&apos;t apply anywhere else. I tell them that it has is amazing if you want to study sciences, the tuition is great because I&apos;m an alaskan resident, and its a billion times better than UAA. \\n I very much enjoy the layout of the university&apos;s campus as well. I am a resident of Moore Hall and all of my classes are extremely accessible from my dorm. The dorm is self is kinda so-so, but its old so whatever. I am extremely satisfied with my living quarters, of course its small, but I didn&apos;t expect otherwise, its a freshman dorm. I did not expect to be living in a palace. \\n The classes and teachers are amazing as well. I don&apos;t have a single class that I am taking where I do not like my teacher or how the class is taught. They are all difficult enough to keep me intrigued, but aren&apos;t too difficult for me to just say F*** it and give up. \\n The main complaint I get from people is that it is too cold in fairbanks. My response to those people is to buy a warm jacket and quit their bitching. Pardon my vulgarity. Of course it&apos;s cold, its Alaska. If you want to be warm go somewhere else. My only complaint is that the hill down to the commons gets extremely icy so its difficult to walk down. But I plan on buying a sled soon, so my complaint will be obsolete. \\n The food at the Tilly (the commons), is...... well dorm food. So I don&apos;t expect much from it. Though occasionally, there is pretty decent food. A few times they have had roast beef which they carve, and my favorite dish was the pasta that they made a few weeks back. But hands down, UNLIMITED SOFT SERVE ICE CREAM FTW! (when the machine works). I very much enjoy ordering the &quot;420&quot; which is a quesadilla, with a double bacon cheese burger, chicken pieces, grilled onions, and pretty much what ever else you want in it. You can order it at the grill. It&apos;s pretty freaking delicious. but you have to be hungry. I recommend when there is mac and cheese, to open it up and put some mac and cheese in it. I also once put gravy on it, MIND BLOWN! it was delicious, I&apos;m pretty sure I ate two of them. Which is a lot because they are quite big. \\n Overall I am a fan of UAF, it is a great college and I&apos;m getting a lot out of it, and I hope to leave fully educated in which ever field I chose to be in, which at the moment is geology, which is very interesting and especially being in Alaska where the Geology is ridiculous, it is a great major to look into.",

            "description": "Despite the bad things Ive heard about UAF, from the terrible parking system to the teachers to the gross campus cafeteria, I would say that this university offers a great education with helpful staff and great programs. The new student office is easy to get through with the help desk as the entrance. The lines are small and the employees work fast. The campus has a lot of food options outside of the cafeteria. There is a taco bell, which offers almost all of the same products as the off campus ones. They have a pizza place, a coffee place, and a sushi booth all in the upstairs of the wood center! The wood center also has pool, foosball, arcade games, bowling, and TVs to watch. Its also the center for all kinds of events, from video game tournaments to monday night football and job fairs. The campus bus system is very helpful, especially once it starts getting cold out. There is a bus that goes up and down 1 street, and it brings you from parking to the center of campus. It sure beats walking, and the wait is short. \\n\\nThe teachers are wonderful. Of the 5 teachers ive experienced, they have all been funny, helpful, and very good at involving their students and teaching the information they test you on. The dorms are also a breath of fresh air. There is a convenience store on the bottom floor, along with a subway. The subway offers reduced price 6 inch sandwiches, which is great to grab before you head up to your dorm.  The library is much better than I had thought when I first walked in. There is a coffee stand in a room near the front, and there are tons of floors to study on. Its easy to get away from any disturbances by heading to a different floor. There are computers for everyone to use, and printers ready to use. The chairs are comfy and the front desk is very helpful. If uaf is your best option for schooling, dont be discouraged by the rumors.",

Since then, all three of my boys have attended Kumon. What really stuck out to me was how much Ms. Das was invested in my boys. Her ability to identify my sons&apos; strengths and weaknesses was an integral part of their progress. The team of educators that she has is very good and they have remained consistent throughout. In the 6 years that I have been there, I have seen little to no staffing changes, which is very beneficial to a child&apos;s progress. I highly recommend Kumon-West Little Rock to anyone considering it. Thank you Kumon for everything that you have done for my three boys!!",

This school has tore my spirit up due to unprofessional friendships between staff and students which in turn cause you to not have clients like the friend of welcome desk. The education is sub part and 98% of the time we don&apos;t even get to use real product. All that I find valuable in the school is the name. There are a few shining jewels of teachers but they have slowly started firing the ones who actually cared about the students once we got the newest director who has family on the staff",

I got two shampoos in addition to the haircut, one before and one after.  \\n\\nThe icing on the cake is that military gets free haircut.

So much gossiping, joking around, singing and basically I felt like I was just one of those mannequin heads they practice on. Seems like the students should be taught when you make a mistake you don&apos;t announce it for all to hear but instead go find your instructor and quietly tell them what you did wrong. It doesn&apos;t make the customer feel confident about the service they are receiving. The young lady that first introduced herself to me was very sweet but really unsure of herself which is understandable. There were two students working on coloring my hair and neither had a clue as to what they were doing. The instructor left them to their own devices and when she did come back she had to take over because the bleach had been on for quite a while and she had to correct their mistakes. I don&apos;t really blame the students because they didn&apos;t really seem to have a lot of instruction. It took over four hours for them to do my hair and since they were closing they didn&apos;t get to the cut. The color didn&apos;t achieve what was intended but I didn&apos;t really expect it to. But I am pleased with the results. The instructor seems to know her stuff and ended up doing the majority of my color. I would say the main thing I was disappointed in was the lack of professionalism.",

Basically the young lady who answered the phone says you can just come in and find out, there may or may not be someone who can perform your services. I am not going to waste a trip for a maybe. I understand systems may be down, but to tell me you&apos;re in the back and can not see who is on the floor does not help at all. I would not have minded to be placed on hold while she checked. It would be so much easier for her to go find out then for me to make a trip only to be turned away. The guest is not at fault because the system is down and should not be punished. Good guest services is very important and I did not receive that. I contacted the school to report what took place and was told that the Sales Leader would contact me. That never happened, places that don&apos;t value customers do not get repeat business. Haven&apos;t been back since.",

While UCA has very strong and well-rounded Chemistry and Physics departments (some of the best in the state, in my opinion), they tend to focus their interests in Football and Business. While this is their main constituency in numbers, I feel that this is a fatal move that can keep this school focusing on the less relevant features of a top-notch school. The recent donation to the Lewis Science Center from Conway Corp and the recent large acquisitions of research funding by the departments should stand as an extreme message to Tom Courtway that the real substance of a successful school is in its academia and not its sports. This is why UCA receives 4 out of 5 from me. \\n\\nThere&apos;s a lot of potential for this school in the sciences. The science departments have top-notch professors that are sending students off to graduate school at places like Harvard, Cornell, Georgia-Tech, Penn State and other high quality graduate schools. It just feels like no one is noticing the extreme achievements of these professors and missing a grand opportunity to capitalize on UCA&apos;s true strengths. Get with it, Mr. Courtway. You have an excellent opportunity with these professors. A great school is built off of strong science and academia, not sports. This is where UCA should be sinking its money.\\n\\nBut, as I am graduating soon, I appreciate the opportunities afforded to me at this university. UCA has provided a decent experience for me and allowed me to expand into new territories of my life that were previously unreachable. Thank you!",

She&apos;s even created a kuspuk pattern you can buy at the store. There&apos;s tons of different options for notions, fabrics and that elusive serger thread. Best of all, she carries a full line of Bernina sewing machines and supplies. My favorite! If you have a spare hour, or three, be sure to visit. If you are a sewist you will love this place!",

I&apos;ve taken a couple of classes from Jodi, the owner.  she came to our small town of Tenakee and taught a group of us how to make kuspuks from her pattern.  She even brought out fabric choices for some of the class participants.  She is a very skilled and patient instructor. We had fun learning and came out of the class with beautiful garments. I&apos;ve also taken a by Annie bag making class with Jodi. I had already made a couple of the bags on my own, but it was great to get some tips and tools from Jodi that made the process even easier and more enjoyable.\\nI do not live in Juneau, so I buy most of my Raintree fabrics online.  Jodi&apos;s website is very easy to use.  If you do have questions, you can call the shop and get them answered by a helpful, knowledgeable person.  I think every time I have placed an online order it gets mailed to me that day.\\nI always try to stop by the shop in person when I do get to town.  It is a very fun place to visit.  So many lovely fabrics, patterns and project ideas.  \\nI have also bought two sewing machines from the shop.  Both of the machines were trade-ins that were like new. I have sewn many projects using these machines and have never had a problem with them.",

From our first email of just asking if he knew any photographers, Peter was so kind to step up to the plate. He told me he had a great idea for a photo shoot and he would pick us up from the docks.\\n\\nI am still in awe that Peter knew exactly what I was looking for... cinematic location that focuses on the beauty of Alaska. Nailed it! He also toured us to the non-touristy area of Mendenhall so we could enjoy the glacier without the crowds, taught us all he knew about the salmon fish hatchery &amp; even fed us freshly caught smoked salmon.\\n\\nPeter and his wife Alicia are bar none the highlight of our Juneau visit. Don&apos;t miss out on this one of a kind experience!",

Before the trip, he took the time to help us carefully consider different options thoroughly and patiently answered all of our questions. He knows everything about photography, glaciers, and Juneau and will make sure you are ready for your adventure - no matter what your experience level is.\\n\\nDuring the trip, he and Josh showed us how to rappel into ice caves, taught us how to take photos like Peter&apos;s award-winning work, and even climb back up with ice axes. Peter and his wife were generous enough to bring lunch &amp; homemade snacks that gave us the energy to spend 8 hours trekking across the glacier.\\n\\nWhat I didn&apos;t know was that he had been working with my now-fianc\u00e9 to plan a surprise proposal for the last 30 mins of the glacier trek... And it was perfect. Not only did he find a stunning ice cave and help us take incredible pictures, but he and his wife made us feel so loved by paying attention to details like bringing little champagne bottles to celebrate!\\n\\nThank you Peter, Alicia and Josh for your kindness, guidance, and friendship. Highly recommend booking a tour with these amazing folks for an unforgettable experience!",

We had an awesome time adventuring and taking pictures with Peter. He made us feel like we were adventuring and learning with a friend. Peter is knowledgeable and helpful. He went out of his way to make us feel at home in Juneau, including drying wet hiking boots! While I have a strong understanding of photography, I learned an incredible amount from Peter, who also took the time to help with some photo editing. My wife, who is a beginner photographer, also learned a great deal from Peter, who was extremely patient. She learned how to set up her camera, how to feel more confident with some of the technical aspects of the camera, and how to create artistic composition. Peter is excellent with photographers and adventurers of all levels. We walked away from our adventure with some outstanding photos to document our adventure, as well as a new friend. \\n\\nThank you Peter, for your guidance and hospitality. The next time we are in Juneau, we plan to book another adventure. We highly recommend booking a photography adventure with Peter.",

Now we have been able to experience all the makes CHP so special first hand. Our older daughter spent 2 years at CHP and is now thriving in Kindergarten as she has entered so prepared. Our younger daughter is in her second year and in the 3s program with her cousin and both are having the same amazing experience. \\n\\nWe have been so happy to see the incredibly supportive, nurturing, creative and engaging experience that CHP creates. The teachers and the school leadership are so invested and committed to the kids. We feel thankful knowing our girls are in such good hands each day at drop-off. \\n\\nThe classroom is such a wonderful place for the children to explore. It is organized into different centers and the children have time to explore on their own as well as with more structured enrichment. It really gives the children time to engage with different areas of learning on their own, with their peers and with the teachers. The ratio of teachers to students is small so there is always support and supervision but the kids also have a great sense of autonomy.\\n\\nOur oldest daughter grew so much (academically, socially and artistically) in her first year and could not wait to return. She loved her time in the 4s program and loved being a big kid in the open classroom. Now our youngest has fallen in love with CHP. She used to cry on days she was not scheduled to attend and is so happy to be going 5 days a week this year. Our family feels so fortunate to have found CHP.",

            "description": "I recently completed the CLA 16 hour crash course. I had a great experience with Rebecca as my teacher. The class was structured in a way that I could quickly feel that I was learning how to talk about different things. Each week, we reviewed the previous and then moved into the new topic. Each class was very interactive which enabled me to learn more in a couple of hours (along with a bit of studying between) than I ever could have alone, because I had to focus quite intently on learning/practicing during each session. I definitely would recommend.",

            "description": "Let me start by saying I took the CLA 16 class - this is exactly what it advertises - a crash course. You cover a TON of material in 4-hour sessions over a 4 week period - and at the end, you won&apos;t be fluent, but you&apos;ll have a strong working knowledge of mandarin, be able to have basic conversations, and have some ability to read and write in Mandarin - but be ready to commit to the class, and be ready to spend some time (30-60 minutes a day) studying and doing the homework.\\n\\nAll of that said, I loved my experience. The course does immerse you quickly, and our instructor, Rebecca, was energetic, smart, and a great at explaining material, helping us practice, providing constructive feedback, and most importantly, patient as we stumbled through pronunciation and vocabulary.",

It&apos;s exactly what it claims -- a feverishly intense 16 hours of cramming Mandarin into your brain. Ms Chen is a native speaker and a gifted teacher with a passion for the language and culture of China. That passion, along with her patience and lighthearted sense of humor, really helped keep the class going during the 4-hour sessions. \\n\\nThis is not a lightweight course. There is a good deal of homework, which I found very helpful to reinforce what I had learned. In addition, you will need to do a lot of studying between classes to review, and commit to memory, what you learned in the previous week&apos;s 4-hour class. If you do that, you should finish the course with a skeletal understanding of basic Chinese pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary for various common, simple sentences, giving you a basis to build upon with further study.\\n\\nIt&apos;s apparent that the mission of the teacher, and the school, goes beyond just making a buck. They truly want to share their language with the world. If you&apos;re looking for any kind of Chinese instruction in NYC, try this friendly, caring, and effective school first.",

I learned so much because the class was a perfect balance between disciplined, informative, structured material (weekly homework, textbook, vocab, character writing exercises) and fun, cultural, contextual material (Chinese songs, finding personal examples, applying what we learned).\\n\\nThe class moves fast (which is exactly what I expected, given that it&apos;s branded as a &quot;crash course&quot;) and is a great introduction for those who want to test out Mandarin before committing to a full semester. The class size was small, which allowed for questions and interactions.\\n\\nLastly, just like with any other languages, you get what you put into it :)",

I wanted to learn because of my husband and also found that it would be useful to learn Mandarin so I can relate with Chinese speaking patients and clients in my profession. Dont be intimidated as I was at first with the idea that many topics will be covered in just a few weeks. The format and their teaching style is so effective and engaging. They taught us the foundations during this course that made a difference and helped me understand the words I am learning, be able to read/pronounce pinyin, put sentences together as compared to before taking this class, I was just memorizing words I find online but not understanding. I am so happy they accommodated to the current global situation and offered this course online and kept it as engaging as it would be in person. I had Rebecca for CLA16 and just ended the Elementary B with Chelsea, they are amazing! I&apos;m encouraged to continue and learn more on the next level because my husband can see my improvement from memorizing a few words I didnt really understand before taking these classes to being able to have simple exchanges in Mandarin and knowing how to read and understand the context in Pinyin.",

Rebecca is a great teacher and works hard to keep the class interactive, which can be especially tough on the weekend track of this class as it is four hours on a single day each weekend. As kind and funny as she is though, make no mistake: she&apos;s a strict teacher, and she ensures you learn the material and practice speaking as pronunciation is integral to communicating in Mandarin. Vocal inflection changes the meaning of the word you use so she appropriately spent a lot of time correcting our pronunciation and teaching us to hear hers. \\n\\nWhat I didn&apos;t expect, but was excited to discover, was that Rebecca incorporated Chinese history and culture into the class as she taught us the language. I took the class out of intellectual curiosity but there were many in the class who got enough out of it for business purposes, personal travel, etc.",

The course itself is relatively intense, with four 4 hour sessions spread over a month, with an hour or so of homework each week.  The course was a great introduction to Mandarin. Our instructor Rebecca was a fantastic instructor, keeping our small class engaged and challenged.  The classes were very interactive and fun, as well as reasonably priced.  I had to miss a class and Rebecca was very flexible in organizing a make up class.  I really enjoyed my overall experience and plan to continue my Mandarin education with CLA in the future...",

I chose CLA&apos;s class over similar programs because to the Yelp reviews as well as the price (believe tuition was at a discount for the month of December) and I am so glad I did! \\nClass size was small (5) allowing ample time for each student to interact with the teacher and each other and the other students were all motivated to be there for their own reason. Our teacher Rebecca was excellent- she made learning a very intimidating language approachable. A lot of time was spent laughing and learning. She did an especially good job working with us on our pronunciation which is key to Mandarin as a tonal language. \\nWhile faster paced, the work in this class was not overwhelming. I was able to manage a full-time job with the homework and practice. It is a good foundation for those wanting a taste of Mandarin before delving deeper. The class focuses fairly equally on speaking and writing (simplified). Results-wise CLA works; my boyfriend was amazed that he could actually understand what I was saying!",

Learning Chinese with CLA was so motivating and results were immediately apparent. They really dig into the root and meaning of the language in such an efficient way; no unnecessary clutter and time wasting. But they always keep it engaging and fun! The teachers really understand how to guide your learning and dedicated themselves fully to us. I took the 1 month starter course and already I am writing and speaking paragraphs! This is my first Asian language! In just 4 classes! I really can not recommend this program enough. I was always encouraged and they really clicked into my personal way of learning, even in a group class. If you have any serious desire to learn Chinese in any capacity, really, this program is the best option out there.",

I completed the 16 hour beginners intensive program last week and I must say the outcome exceeded my expectations..\\nAbout a year ago - being bored to death at my then job - I took my first steps with mandarin on my own. Thank God I soon changed job, so no time for mandarin. A couple months later I took classes for a month which I&apos;d say were pretty much disappointing: the teacher hardly spoke english, there was to system or organization, so I damped the dream of mandarin..\\nHowever, last month - thank God - I decided to give it a shot with CLA. Bingo! For the first time I started feeling I understand the framework of this very different language. The teacher, Wangqi, is amazing: organized, supporting and incredibly responsible and serious on her mission: if it was solely up to her we would never take breaks ;-)\\nThe academic material is very well selected and diverse (listening, writing, playing, songs, good books, smart additional material, video recommendation), the size of the groups ensures everyone has enough time to participate and work on the language and I loved the follow up emails after each session!\\nI definitely didn&apos;t expect after 4 session to be in the position to conduct basic dialogues, to recognize - even write certain characters - and actually be past my 4 tones initial terror.\\nI highly recommend CLA and I sincerely congratulate them.\\nOf course I&apos;ll start the next course in a week ;-)",

You get detailed explanations for the little pieces of word and characters which makes remembering them much easier. You also get analysis of grammar rules which free apps don&apos;t give you with the same depth. The homework is also great for continuing to learn at home. I wish there was more of it. The most outstanding part of the course is the personalized help over email. Outside of class, I can send questions and get helpful answers over email which is very convenient. Overall it is very worth the money. I&apos;ll definitely be signing up for the more advanced courses!",

My wife and I were putting our son into daycare at 3 months and were VERY anxious about it. Our first week we did a slow entry, a couple of hours days one, three hours day two, etc. and it was SO helpful as we acclimated emotionally and logistically. \\n\\nPrior to selecting Shining Smiles, we took a tour and met with Director Katherine. We went through their entire curricula, discussed COVID protocols, and really got a feel for their approach to early childhood education. \\n\\nOur son has now been at Shining Smiles since November 2021 and we couldn&apos;t be happier. We receive regular communication about feeding, diaper changes, and pictures during story time and other activities via the ProCare app. You think to yourself, why would I care/want to track feedings, etc. But you do, you really do. Our son&apos;s teachers clearly have bonded with him and he with them, there&apos;s such a connection that when we do pick up he&apos;s generally all smiles and laughing as we say goodbye for the day. \\n\\nTrusting who looks after your child for 8 to 9 hours a day is not easy, but when you find a place like Shining Smiles it really puts your mind at ease.",

Shining Smiles is more flexible than other daycares in the area tend to be (we started bb at two days/week, and now she&apos;s at four days/week), and the teachers are capable, kind, loving, and dedicated. Miss Sylvia and Miss Naomi were so patient with our daughter taking a pretty long time to adjust to the daycare nap scheduling when she first got there (also Miss Naomi is still the only adult who my daughter is willing to say &quot;love you&quot; back to lol), and Miss Sandy and Miss Catina have taken amazing care of her now that she&apos;s moved up to an older room (they even weaned her off her pacifier, which we would absolutely not have been able to do as smoothly on our own). Our daughter is often at Shining Smiles for pretty long days, often 8 to 5:30, and when we come to get her she is happy and so well taken care of. \\n\\nI&apos;ve recommended Shining Smiles to many friends, and am leaving this review because the daycare hunt in Brooklyn can be so nuts. Aside from the way they care for our daughter, we really appreciate that she&apos;s in a diverse group of kids, that the facility is set up to accommodate parents who work long hours and/or who need to return to work soon after birth, that it&apos;s one of the more affordable options in the area, that it&apos;s pretty no-nonsense in many respects (no flowery learning philosophies for babies who just need to have a good time hanging out), and that they will do cloth diapers for your baby if you do them at home!",

It has been an incredible experience to have him cared for by genuinely wonderful people. He struggled a bit in the beginning with the transition to daycare but the team handled it beautifully, and with a lot of patience. Now, he jumps in his stroller in the morning, excited to see his teachers and friends. Literally. \\n\\nThe teachers are excellent, the staff is communicative (love the app!!), and the space is clearly purpose-built for a daycare. All around, we couldn&apos;t be happier with our experience at Shining Smiles!",

We have two children in the program (one infant, one three year old) and we could not be happier with the exceptional learning experiences and childcare that Shining Smiles is providing. The classrooms are bright and filled with all sorts of age/developmentally appropriate toys and activity stations, and the highly-trained professional staff are all loving, warm, and fun--we feel incredibly lucky to have found such a wonderful school/daycare. Our son wakes up every day asking to go to &quot;big boy school,&quot; and we love watching him learn and grow as he moves through the Shining Smiles pre-school curriculum. He is also acquiring new social skills and life skills, such as how to work collaboratively and how to use safety scissors. Our baby is picking up new things every day, and she gets her mental and physical workouts every day through story time, sign language lessons, art projects, and gross-motor activities such as the all-important tummy time! She is also gaining skills such as how to wave hello and good-bye and how to drink from a sippy-cup. Weather-permitting, the staff takes the children out in the neighborhood or to the playground--donned in their cute in their little Shining Smiles smocks! The staff and management are extremely professional and responsive, and communication is conducted mostly through an app through which they share messages as well as frequent daily updates on the basics such as meals, bathroom breaks, and naps. They also send photos of the days activities, which brighten my day. I would give Shining Smiles more stars if I could. We attended the Gold Street location before my son      was of pre-school age, and we received the same outstanding care from amazing, loving, caring professionals there. Book your tour!",

The sense of achievement is unparalleled, the teachers are great and you really learn in a cool, fun environment. They even have wine/beer (after you&apos;ve used the dangerous tools).  Cool space with genuinely creative maker community. EXCELLENT for anyone tired of the desk life and yearning to rediscover real things.",

I had never heard of Tabel 87 either (I guess I live under a rock, or in Manhattan) but I will now be a fan for the rest of my days.\\nI have NEVER made anything like a lamp or even cut copper pipes, but the guide was so laid back and gave great direction. I felt like I was really doing it myself but I also didn&apos;t feel nervous or self conscious about my lack of experiencing soldering or using a pipe cutter. I feel pretty awesome about myself after the whole experience, and my husband who was initially a reluctant participant was inspired to try out other workshops in the future. We will be back!",

I was lucky enough to get a four-hour private stained glass lesson with Kelsie McNair, and while I have a lot to practice and plenty more to learn, I feel equipped enough to practice on my own.  \\n\\nSoup to nuts, we went from design idea, to material selection and through all key steps of the process to make a window hanger.  As a novice, I&apos;m surprised I walked away with anything respectable but I did!  All the while, Kelsie, the instructor and Chris the manager were good natured and supportive. They are people you&apos;d happily hang out with and made it very easy to learn from.  \\n\\nToday far exceeded expectations and increased my interest in the craft.  This session was a gift and I would recommend it for others.",

The class size was small, and so we had tons hands-on practice and loads of interaction with our awesome instructor Jerome, who was knowledgeable, patient, and super friendly. Jerome began the class by giving us an overview of the steps that we would take to fabricate a metal planter. Next, he explained each step and the proper use of each tool as we completed each stage toward our final result. He ensured that students were  adhering to safe and proper use of tools throughout, as he offered encouragement and tips to ensure a better result. All told, I couldn&apos;t ask for a better experience, and is exactly the entry-point that I needed to start practicing these skills on my own.\\n\\nAlthough Craftsman Ave is a good distance from my NJ home, I&apos;m strongly considering taking another class. If they offer the Customize Your Own Motorcycle class again, I will crawl through broken glass to attend. If they open a Montclair, NJ branch of this place, I&apos;m renting the apartment above. \\n\\nIf you haven&apos;t grinded down welds while listening to rock cranking in the background, you haven&apos;t lived!",

Some woods are extremely toxic to breath in and some folks are allergic without ever knowing it until they experience it. \\n\\nAt Craftman&apos;s there are no ceiling, floor or individual hook up ventilation systems to filter and bag the wood dust from the table saw, band saw or sander.  A cloud of dust enveloped the table saw as we cut about two dozen pieces of wood.  This lead me to notice the amount of wood dust coating the walls and surrounding all the wood working equipment. \\n\\nThe class was ok, but the amount of wood dust makes it unsafe for me to take another class with them.\\n\\nIf you take a wood class there, I would advise bringing one of those throw away nurses mask and a set of ear plugs.

The reception was after sunset, and with the lights out and candles everywhere, the room was dark and beautiful with the city lights outside. I was a little worried after being warned about being too loud, the neighbors complaining, etc, but nothing at all happened! Go talk to Amy (the rental manager) and tell her you want to hold your happy occasions there. You&apos;ll be doing a mitzvah!",

            "description": "Signed up for the gym here a month ago and Manny Cantor has been like a second home. It&apos;s on the small side but I&apos;ve found the community here incredibly inclusive and genuinely non-judgmental. The mixed reviews on here seem misleading as they are for different services.\\n\\nPros: Price, I signed up for the $70/month family deal, which isn&apos;t bad at all given the convenience, service, classes offered, and knowing my money is going to a local, community center and not a chain with difficult contracts and surcharges. I signed up with Mallory and she was personable and friendly, giving me a in-depth tour while patiently answering all of my questions.\\n\\n-Classes are fun and small. So far, I&apos;ve been to spinning and Zumba. Instructors were friendly and attentive.\\n\\n-Cleanliness is an A+, I go in the late morning or late at night. It&apos;s always spotless and cleaning stations are always stocked.\\n\\n-Music is great. It&apos;s an eclectic mix with songs like Daddy Yankee&apos;s &quot;Gasolina&quot; and chill, indie-pop. Whoever is making the playlists needs to be posting it online. The volume is on the low-side as many work out to their own music, but I&apos;ve definitely stopped mid-workout to Shazam a song or two. \\n\\nCons: None! I&apos;m a happy camper and love it!",

The place was brand new and very clean.\\n\\nNow, there is a lot more people, the restroom are filthy, the fitness room&apos;s floor is disgusting because people come from outside with their shoes : how am I suppose to put my face close to this floor where I can see hair, dirt, sweat spots ??!\\n\\nI&apos;ve been many time to morning yoga classes, and they allow people to get in when they are late, during the meditation part, and even when it&apos;s super crowded. Disrespectful. People complained, and nothing was ever done. \\n\\nLast time I&apos;ve been, it was very hot and there was no AC....... Out of order for two month !!!!!!\\n\\nSome teachers are amazing (especially Chintamani, Stephen, or Carolina) but I&apos;m very angry against the management : There use to be classic amazing Pilates classes, and now there is only pretentious cardio Pilates, with marketing names like &quot;POP Pilates&quot;.... which I find ridiculous and has nothing to do with Pilates, and everything to do with cardio and gym. Pilates has a purpose. And it&apos;s NOT to be fast. Please, there was plenty of other workout such as Zumba which includes cardio. AND EVEN IF sometimes a class is not overcrowded doesn&apos;t mean there is no need for this kind of class. Not everyone needs to be sore or risk a heart attack to feel thin. \\n\\n- You&apos;ve lost me. -",

It really is a damn shame because these courts are new and decent...now if only we can PLAY BASKETBALL ON THEM. SMH.\\n\\nWhen I joined this gym, I was told that the basketball courts would be mostly accessible unless it was only being rented - apparently, that is not the case anymore because they wouldn&apos;t even let you use to it play ball even when it&apos;s not being used!

However I just cancelled this month because I don&apos;t use the gym enough that will make it worth it. \\n\\nThe bathroom is quite small compared to other places. It&apos;s fairly clean. It has lockers but you have to bring your own locks. Don&apos;t expect towels or any other things here. \\n\\nI took some classes. The spin class teacher was good but I stopped because my knee started to hurt. The other classes I took were not challenging enough. It&apos;s more for people who are starting to get into shape. I like more intense classes. And I&apos;m not into yoga so I don&apos;t know how that is. Some of the classes you have to pay extra which is a bit annoying. \\n\\nIt&apos;s an okay gym. If you just need a place to work out with basic machines.. then it&apos;s good. It gets a bit crowded around 5-7 on weekdays. \\n\\nI wish it had a pool then I would more likely to stay.",

All the jump ropes are broken\\n\\nThey send emails constantly about changes to the classes being taught. \\n\\nThere are routine alterations being done to the building that limit the gyms availability or take up time. \\n\\nThe music being played over the PA is always too loud or too faint.\\n\\nI&apos;d give this place 2 stars on just the fact that the equipment is new.

I am a native LES resident since birth, and I was very excited to hear about this gym coming to our neighborhood, I joined last fall as a Charter member, the open date was pushed a few times and yes there were a few snags to get through just like it would be with any business opening its doors, (first few weeks they had no hot water in the women&apos;s locker room) but that has been fixed.  They took a little while to get benches and stools in the locker rooms, but also has been resolved. The other issue that came up early on were the ID&apos;s, but also resolved.  In essence those issues are non issues at this point. \\n\\nThe age limit is 16 and over just like any other gym which makes sense, they have convenient daycare on the 1st floor for children up to 6 or 7 I believe which is helpful. \\n\\nFacilities: They are clean, well kept, beautiful, there are plenty of machines, lots of space, the room for aerobic classes is expansive, it is where I do my stretching, where many go to stretch, do free weights, jump rope or do stepping on their own. Also there are lots of classes to choose from, I have participated in the Masala with Chloe (she is great!) and in the Zumba classes which is included in the monthly price. Yes like some reviewers have said on here, classes are sometimes subbed last minute, but I&apos;m sure that happens elsewhere, instructors are human too and things come up understandably. They have YOGA on the 6th floor where you can experience sunrise or sunset beautifully. \\n\\nThe staff: they always welcome members with a smile, are helpful, professional, not once so far have been concerned with customer service.  Brien Jones the GM is super. He says hello, stops and talks to folks, asks how people are doing, I get the feeling that he really cares and is dedicated to running a smooth operation.  He is approachable and knowledgeable about fitness. I needed help and asked him a question about normal heart rates and he was able to be helpful to me. \\n\\nI am actually going to add my husband to my membership just in time for Father&apos;s Day weekend.",

First off let me start by saying I was very enthusiastic about putting my toddler there because the building is so beautifully done I signed her up when I was in desperate need of childcare she was about 1 year old. I had a staff member named Maria who helped me tremendously she resides in the neighborhood and she really wanted to reach out and help out so I applaud her for her for her help with this situation. Now my daughter is nearly 3 years old and still not placed into manny cantor center I&apos;ve gotten at least two phone calls not from Maria from for other staff saying that a process opened up for her but it was on Avenue D. I live on Clinton Street and I was not going to go out of my way when manny cantor center is right around the corner from my house the second call was to say that was a slot open up at PS 140 which too is a distance away from my home and work to say the least I have opted out of trying anymore I&apos;m very disgruntled and the staff other than Maria didn&apos;t seem to be interested in helping the community when you look at the makeup of the class  you&apos;re most likely going to see (no disrespect)all Asian and white students.  This community is a very diverse community and should reflect on the classmates in the classroom however majority of the blacks and Hispanics are being placed in other locations I want to give a big negative shout out to the manny cantor educational Alliance for not supporting their community.\\nP.s. if they call me now for placement I will decline my daughter is in a great learning environment and is thriving. thank you very much",

Both schools will give kids a top-notch education, but the schools are not for everyone. \\n\\nBard Manhattan was the first of its kind, a public high school with an accelerated program that takes 2 years to complete. The second two years are for college-level work (and, indeed, kids graduate after 4 years total with both a HS diploma and an A.A. degree from Bard College). Those 2 years of college credits can be transferred to some 4-year colleges, giving kids who want it a huge savings in both time and money.\\n\\nSo the work is advanced and fast-moving: that&apos;s a given. Kids have to take a placement exam (not the SHSAT) to qualify, but even if you do well, it&apos;s hard to say whether BHSEC Manhattan is for you. It&apos;s a small school, and there aren&apos;t as many clubs as you can find elsewhere. Sports are not a huge part of the culture here. It&apos;s a long walk/bus ride from the nearest subway line. Writing is very important; you don&apos;t have to be a great writer at 14, but you should probably be open to improving in this area.\\n\\nThose are the caveats. \\n\\nThe benefits of this school are enormous. The quality of the faculty is amazingly high (lots of PhD&apos;s), and they were always accessible for advice/extra help/mentoring. The administration was responsive, in my experience. College counseling was knowledgeable and hands-on.\\n\\nThe classes are small and most are seminar-style. Lots of discussion, lots of back-and-forth in the classroom, lots of writing (see above). Expectations are high; you&apos;re expected to work hard and be intellectually curious. If you want big lectures, multiple-choice tests, and anonymity--forget it. \\n\\nThe BHSEC model has expanded to Newark, Cleveland, and New Orleans. Clearly, there&apos;s a demand for accelerated HS education. For the right kid, these schools will be life-changing. As with any educational choice, the key is to know yourself.",

It truly is a haven within the concrete jungle. The teachers are respectful of each other, are nurturing, and I couldn&apos;t have imagined a more loving teacher-child connection. The classroom and school environment are beautiful with use of natural and organic materials, and with wholesome food prepared, it really is a place that nourishes the whole child.

Also gets up early in the morning to finish the homework without pressure from us or the teacher.\\n\\nI just read a august 2016 review where communication was not clear or sufficient to a parent. This is sadly something that needs work, and I am sure the school is addressing after seeing the review.

A bright child, his academics were never a problem, but he started hating school, all the homework for homework sake &amp; the many rules that made him feel uncomfortable every expressing himself. He was becoming depressed at the age of 7. Things have changed drastically now that he is in Altschool with teachers who regularly encourage him to speak up and has internalized the notion that his thoughts are important. He sets goals for himself (work better with others, always have sources for project points) and actively pushes himself to get better. His curiosity is back in full bloom, he takes an interest in and asks questions about everything.  Altschool values things like grit, optimism, resilience, gratitude, purpose etc. These are the kind of values every school should focus on. We feel privileged that not only does our child go to a school that is innovating education for our kids, they are also building a platform that will help teachers and administrators around the country so that more children can benefit in a sustainable way. Last but not least, I deeply appreciate the wonderful and diverse parent community in Altschool is so committed and involved in the school. It is a bunch of forward thinking professionals that have a higher standard of education for our children and are committed to work towards making sure our children get the kind of education they deserve.",

            "description": "I have two kids at Alt School Brooklyn Heights. I think Alt does one thing better than anyone else, which is to teach kids to love going to school, to teach them to love to learn. I&apos;ve spent some time trying to figure out how they do this and I believe it has to do with four big assets they have: 1) a personalized education combined with project-based learning (that ensures a lot of fun for all students), 2) a solid back-end technology platform to keep track of learning progress by subject matter (that ensures that students are actually learning), 3) top-notch teachers that come from top US schools (Alt school gives teachers complete freedom to chose their teaching method and projects), and 4) partnerships with the neighborhood (my kids have PE class at the Brooklyn Pier 5 and have a school trip about once every two or three weeks).  \\nI am particularly happy with the staff and teachers. We have a strong bond, they are available to talk at any time, any day about any topic. If my kids are falling behind in a particular topic, they are fully aware and at the same time, they develop a plan with me to increase the learning progress. I&apos;ve had nothing but friendly encounters with everyone at the school.  \\nFinally, being a relatively new and modern school means they are pretty solid on the user experience as parents. The application process was incredibly easy (they have an ongoing basis application, several open house days, they encourage and set up conversations with current parents for further diligence, absolute transparency about the process, etc), all the required paperwork was done through their website, and once enrolled parents have access to the Stream app with daily reports on student progress, notices, and everything related to admin (sick days, tuition, extended day, etc). \\nIt&apos;s been a fantastic experience and I fully recommend Alt School.",

I received an automated system that transferred me to the Brooklyn location to then still not speak to anyone. I was on the phone with my husband giving him directions to meet me, when someone finally came to the door 20 minutes later. I was then told by a young woman sorry we will call to reschedule. Few days later I received an email saying they will not be moving forward with any of my children applications. One week later I took my other two daughters for an interview and was told due to the fact I was on my phone the last time I was there, I was judged based off of that and my kids will not be accepted. How do you judge my children or me because I was on a call with MY HUSBAND for directions? They had no clue who I was speaking to and regarding what matter. I would definitely NOT recommend this school to anyone, there are a lot of other good private schools with more reputable reputations.",

We took the 1/2 day beginner class where you make a bowl from a chunk of wood.  As a person with 5 thumbs and cannot draw a straight line, I made a beautiful bowl.  The instructor is very patient and good at fixing your mistakes. Wonderful class, learned a lot, and walked out with a nice token of my talent (or lack of talent).

            "description": "Been attending JTCC since Fall of 2016 for Science Specialization to transfer. I was dual enrolled for two years at one of the tech centers for baking/ pastry arts and culinary arts. But when I was &apos;enrolling&apos; for fall classes, I went for guidance on program selecting and class enrollment from a counselor (tall, Caucasian, glasses, Moyar hall). He was rude, asked as if I was supposed to know exactly what to do when I first stepped foot into the college for the first time. I asked step by step on how to enroll for classes, instead of showing me on a computer or directing me to another staff member, he handed me a brochure on how to do it and said I need to go home and learn for myself. Then a few days later, I went to Wendy, she guided me through it. She was great, and made the process look easy.\\nBut when payment deadlines came along (usually in July for fall enrollment), I was denied financial aid 2 days before payments were due, do I had to use a credit card to pay, which I had no places on doing.\\nBut within the last 5 semesters I&apos;ve attended, my &apos;student routine/ daily life&apos; was decent. There were plenty of activities and academic events for everyone.\\nBut some students are plain ruthless, rude, disruptive, and distractive. Some instructors allowed students to noisily come into class late. Others would allow students to constantly raise their hands for questions that have nothing to do with the learning material.\\nExample: I was in my 8am BIO 102 class. A girl arrives 30 minutes late. 5 minutes into her arrival to class, she raises her hand and asks &quot;What are we learning? I don&apos;t understand it.&quot; How do you not understand the general idea of a class&apos;s material if you need the prerequisites of BIO 101 and MTE 1-9 before you take BIO 102?\\nSome students don&apos;t have access to grants, loans, scholarships, or financial aid so it would be nice if instructors were more strict on students being disruptive and distractive.\\nUPDATE:\\nJust got my &apos;program&apos;/ degree switched. And if your are needing to know what you need to take (class wise) to graduate, dont use the online degree classes lists they have. They havent been updated in 2+ yrs. went to get a waiver (May 17, 2018) for a HLT and ENG class. Turns out I dont need the HLT class. Waste of $400 and waste of an hour being spent in Admin and Records office being belittled by a &apos;vice principal&apos; and her assistant. Still waiting for the ENG dean and the instructor to sign my ENG waiver (which will take two weeks because of summer break). IF YOUR ADVISOR SAYS THAT THWY CANT DO YOUR WAIVERA FOR YOU, THEY ARE LYING AND BEING LAZY. My new advisor (Ashanti Luke) stated in an email that he/ she cant do the waivers, the deans have to. If the deans do the waivers, then why did the HLT dean office and ENG dean office both tell me that the advisors do the waivers? I see it as laziness. This is your job. Most educatora have contracts that supply thwm thwir job/ career. My tuition (that comes out of my pocket, not FASFA) goes into your paychecks. Do your jobs properly, and then maybe there wouldn&apos;t be reviews like this.",

It&apos;s wading through a bunch of BS when you can go simply out and get a teaching job on your own...immediately.  Use the county alternative licensure route (totally free) and skip this racket.  I started with them and quickly got a job in a school on my own.  They wouldn&apos;t refund the money because they said that I dropped the class (which I did not, I was removed from it by the obtuse and bumbling &quot;Dr.&quot; Missy Ogden).

I wanted to register for classes. \\n\\nThis is a beautiful campus that just pops up driving down Route 1 just passed a Target. Multiple buildings, which take some getting used to and a parking situation that I most certainly will need to figure out are interlaced with sidewalks and, from what I could see, a few summertime students. Counselors have extended hours on Mondays (until 7pm) to accommodate those of us who have to go to work everyday. However, this is on a walk-in basis and by the time I arrived, I had followed a line of people who would be keeping to the two counselors busy for the remainder of the office hours. I sent an email to a director in the counseling department to express my dissatisfaction with what appeared to be an unaccommodating system that not only made it an impossibility to accomplish the necessary preregistration counseling, but really had no valid workaround procedures. \\n\\nI was glad that I reached out to get more information. I was directed through a chain of responsible parties until I reached my counselor who obliged to an evening meeting on a day other than Monday (A SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT!!). The counselor got me all squared away and setup and ready to go. To have this stress eliminated is beyond a relief (because of the steps that can start rolling now that this is done). \\n\\nI haven&apos;t taken a class yet, but what I can hope is that the teachers have the same approach to connecting with the students. That will make this next year a breeze.",

Charged us automatically for our kids to use the gym for the reopening, I call and reserve (not first time) for my kids and I to swims laps and general manager come in to kick us out and told us no kids cause it&apos;s no recreational use. I said we already here and we reserved to do laps, just like before, and I said it at phone call. Then tells my husband, they are treating the whole gym like the kid zone being closed, no one under 9. WHICH WAS NEVER IN THE NEW RULES OR EMAIL FOR REOPENING. Or was brought to us  before when we swam laps.\\nBut then allowed a group of senior citizens women come into our lane at 5:46pm even though we were on the reservation from 5-6pm. They all hung out close together for a Zumba class. THEY looked at MY family like we were wrong for not getting out when they got in.  Done with them, blocking them and I suggest everyone else does.\\nThe nice staff didn&apos;t mind my girls and I exercising and swimming laps but general manager wanna make up her own rules and still charge us for the kids. DONT GO TO AMERICAN FAMILY FITNESS THEY DO NOT HONOR FAMILIES PERIOD! We will take our military friends along with us somewhere else and future military friends as well. \\nThank you to the rest of the staff for being so nice to us. \\nUPDATE: General Manager refuses to come out and speak to my husband face to face. WHILE my husband was finishing up his workout she sent a staff to post up a sign saying No kids under 8. \\nSo much for FAMILY fitness.",

I rejoined not even a week ago. I checked the app this morning to see if they were open. The app said yes. Opened at 5am. So i went. Being a person that doesn&apos;t have social media, how was i to know that this is where you post your closures. YOU HAVE A WHOLE APP... shouldn&apos;t that be where you post your closures and time changes. That could be for weather or anything. I actually really love this gym. I love the upstairs so i can feel comfortable when I&apos;m ready to die on the machines because I&apos;m out of shape and i don&apos;t feel like the entire gym in watching me... but anyway... back to my reason for writing... YOU HAVE A WHOLE ENTIRE APP... i had to get a friend at 5:30am to check social media to see if you posted something about weather... lol.. that&apos;s kind of crazy to me... when you HAVE A WHOLE APP that you could have posted on... *breaking weather alert* or anything... come on now... i know it&apos;s 2021 but i shouldn&apos;t be subject to having social media just to know if my gym is open or not.",

I was lured into joining because I thought the contract was 6 months. It is a year. After about 3 short months, I realized that this gym would not fit into my schedule (yes, it is 24 hours...let me elaborate). I am a single parent (yes! They have childcare...I will get there). By the time I am off of work I get to spend roughly 2.5-3 hours with my kid. I would take him to the gym for about an hour to an hour and a half, but he would cry. He did not really click with any of the caregivers. If he cried for more than 5 minutes, they would come get me. Guess what my 2 year old learned? &quot;If I cry, I get mom.&quot; But, that is their &quot;policy.&quot; \\nI have repeatedly asked out of my contract. I agreed to pay a cancelation fee. Yet, I am charged $68 every month for a gym that feels like the creepy side of the family you are forced to see once a year...They refuse to let me out of my contract because it was for A YEAR...Not 6 months. The ones that took your money and you never saw again. Stick to Golds Gym. MILES cheaper, and great childcare. Or Planet Fitness. Anywhere but here!",

As long as you provide us with orders when you leave, we can cancel your membership with no penalty fees!&quot;\\n\\nAfter drilling him for THIRTY MINUTES, asking a zillion questions and even calling my fianc\u00e9 to discuss it, I signed up for a three year family plan......... that&apos;s where the problems started. \\n\\nI was all gung-ho about this gym, SUPER excited to start my workout. Between having just moved in, my two dogs, doctors appointments (I&apos;m a double amputee) and general responsibilities.... my attendance was lacking. Then we add the car accident I was in and TWO falls, I physically could NOT go (not their fault.... wait for it). The first time I could get there after my fall, they CLOSE the pool 15 minutes after I get there. Which is probably for the best, since it&apos;s so disgustingly over chlorinated it made me sick.

            "description": "I&apos;ve been a member at this gym for two months and am appalled at their ... well, let me start with the good (this will not take long). American Family Fitness (AFF) is a large facility and filled of high quality equipment.\\n\\nSee, that didn&apos;t take long. Now for the bad. The staff at this AFF facility is beyond repair. The front desk, as noted by another review, is typically filled with staff members who, on the surface, appear to be nice but do not bother them when they are busy socializing with one another or with friends / family who come in to talk.\\n\\nDo you like clean equipment? You will not find it here. I&apos;m amazed that people do not clean the equipment after they use the machines. Wonderful equipment that is literally rusting away due to lack of cleaning. \\n\\nLets talk about the trainers. There are three trainers I&apos;ve witnessed who do a great job. They work with their clients and provide useful and professional feedback. The rest are not into training you. They are too busy looking around at everyone else but the trainee, they stand with hands in their pockets, but no matter what, you are not their priority.\\n\\nThe members are a unique blend of fit and working out or not fit and just sitting on the equipment in order to look like they are doing something. It&apos;s actually funny to watch. There is one guy who does nothing but walks around the gym drinking water. Every once in a while he stretches then talks to other members or staff.\\n\\nThe fitness classes are at odd times and its hard to get in a class that is actually useful, that is, unless you&apos;re looking for Zumba or group step but this is truly a subjective category.\\n\\nWhat&apos;s more? The price is quite high for what the members get. If the professionalism were there, I wouldn&apos;t have a problem paying the price.\\n\\nOverall, the lack of professional staff is what&apos;s killing this place. This is a workplace, not a hangout. I gave them two stars because this is a nice facility and filled with great equipment. I subtracted one star for the poor cleanliness of the equipment and removed two stars for the staff&apos;s lack of professional behavior. If you don&apos;t care about service or a clean facility, you&apos;ve got an okay place to workout. Otherwise, look elsewhere for a fitness center.",

I drop my toddler off for about an hour when we go on a number of occasions I&apos;ve watched them lead him to a corner hand him a toy and walk away. He then cries because he has been left alone! All the child care attendant stand around the counters talking with not interaction with the kids. Every single time I pick him up he is sitting in a high chair pointed at the tv. I&apos;m gone an hour it&apos;s not that hard to entertain a child for that long. \\n\\nWhen I addressed the issue with the director I was basically told I was making everything up and the tv is always on because the kids ask for it. My child doesn&apos;t know how to talk yet so I know he did not ask for the tv. On our last visit there when putting him in the car I noticed a significant scratch with blood on the side of his head, when I called and asked about it I was told &quot;he didn&apos;t fall I don&apos;t know where it came from&quot;. For a child that&apos;s really calm and easy going he screams and is terrified when I drop him off and we will no longer be trusting our child&apos;s safety to them.",

For starters screw everyone major up and then make them stay for 3+ years then they overcharge you and try to justify it. Living on campus is the worst part about being there the dorms seems nice but they aren&apos;t I can&apos;t believe I wasted 2 semesters of my time there. The food there is horrible and unsanitary they don&apos;t seem to care they just turn a blind eye. Someone really should investigate that school and shut it down ASAP!! Stay away from there if you value your education and pockets!",

            "description": "In the early 2000&apos;s RBC was an excellent school to attend but since Debbie L. Sydow became president the quality of the school has diminished greatly. She doesn&apos;t interact with faculty members or students. A majority of the students have no clue what she looks like because she&apos;s never around.  The school doesn&apos;t have a medical clinic so when students become ill they have to miss several days of class. The cafeteria has very little choices of food to select from, so a majority of the time your stuck eating unhealthy processed food like chicken tenders and fries everyday. Which gets old really fast. The school store lacks things like toiletries and household supplies so if you don&apos;t have a car your out of luck because the nearest store is fifteen miles away. The financial Aid office messed up a lot students funding this semester which left them with out books or meal swipes to eat with. The cafeteria doesn&apos;t open until 1:00 on the weekends so you have no way to get breakfast. The library doesn&apos;t open at all on Saturdays and until 4:00 on Sunday&apos;s. There is absolutely nothing at all to do on campus on the weekends. if you decide to live on campus you will be bored out of your mind. So a majority of the students get drunk or smoke weed. Twenty students were kicked out on the first weekend of school because of it. The school dropped GPA requirements this semester. Which was a big mistake because the quality of the students are trifling and straight rachet. I never saw so many bad weaves in my life!! Freedom Hall reeks of marijuana. The third floor in Patriot Hall smells like feet, onions from bad body odor and weed. Several people have had their property stolen. The housing manager Mr. Scott is never around to rectify the situation but he could careless anyway. He&apos;s very nonchalant about his duties as a manager and has no relationship with the students. So if you like to party and never go to class this is the place for you but if you take your education seriously keep looking .",

I can&apos;t wait to see it once it fired. It takes a week. I&apos;ll post a picture once it arrives. I decided it would be a great date for my husband and I. I certainly will return.",

Definitely plan on taking a few hours to spend here and the process can be tedious. \\n\\nWith regards to their parties... there are room you can reserve (for free) that come with a party host. You&apos;re allowed to bring in decorations, food, music, whatever you need to make your party a success. The worst part is having to wait a week to pick up your pieces. I want them now!

They have a great collection of stamps stencils sponges an extra tools to help make your project perfect. They have to party rooms which are super cute. Actually hope to have a party there in the near future. It&apos;s more expensive then other businesses like this but it&apos;s totally worth it. It&apos;s fun for all ages.

I&apos;m not sure which is the bigger thrill, watching them get into it so enthusiastically or painting ceramics for myself. There is quite a range of ceramic selections to customize. We spend too much of our time trying to pick our dish, vase, tile, animal, character, toy or sport paraphernalia. We get better at the paint and dry cycle every time that we participate. With so many nice little eateries moving in along side it has become the perfect spot for a very engaging date! It&apos;s difficult to leave our little treasures there when we&apos;re done (the art, not the kids). The week long wait to finally retrieve our kiln fired artifact seems indomitable. (It seems, like forever too!)",

Kids choose which &quot;figure&quot; they want to paint and it actually takes longer than I thought it would which was perfect because kids were busy. They also make a special gift for the birthday kid which is a plate with birthday kid&apos;s hand print and guests (kids) get to do their finger print on that plate which is amazing for the memory. Staff is super helpful and polite. We forgot candles and a lighter and they provided that for us not to ruin the birthday cake. Overall, very much would recommend this place.",

I went to Ole Miss (back when it was Ole Miss) and a guy from the Ole Miss rugby team helped start Sewanee&apos;s rugby team back in the day so there is a connection between Ole Miss and Sewanee&apos;s rugby team going back to that point.

The Plant-based Boot Camp was just what I needed to feel more confident and creative preparing vegan meals. Chef TC was amazing! He taught us the science behind different cooking practices and even shared knife skills and other tips to make us as successful as we possibly could be. All the staff are so detail oriented and generous with their knowledge and expertise. It is very apparent that they love what they do and that they are well trained and appreciated.

Knife skills, sauces, killing a lobster, French fries from scratch - we covered all these basics and so much more. Every day we ate our creations and had plenty to bring home, along with all recipes. The staff in the kitchen assisted with expertise; students never had to wash a single dish. Accommodations were made to reschedule if you missed a week here or there and staff was always friendly and professional. The herb garden outside was awesome for seasoning and plating our dishes.

I&apos;m trying to eat healthier, but my primitive creations are sometimes lacking, derided as &quot;swamp water&quot; by my sons. This &quot;boot camp&quot;, packed with great information and aptly named, will help me up my game. \\n\\nOur instructor was extremely knowledgeable and an accomplished chef. The staff was very helpful and supportive and on hand to assist if we ever got stuck or needed help. (Also, they had guys washing dishes, cleaning up, after each round of cooking, which was nice.)\\n\\nThis class taught me a lot about various techniques and and options, including tons of tips that I can use every day. I learned how to make some new healthy dishes that I can cook that actually taste good. \\n\\nAlso, the setting is great, quality steel tables, stoves, knives etc, lots of good utensils and all types of equipment. I have more confidence in using appliances that have been sitting on a shelf in my house, learned how to make sauces, pur\u00e9es and creamy soups (without the cream), as well as some fundamentals about chopping, seasoning, order of adding ingredients.\\n\\nThe boot camp is intense and packed with content, so be prepared for an immersive experience, but it&apos;s is broken up with breaks where you get to eat what you cooked. Fun to meet, work with and eat with other class members. Ended up with lots of good leftovers and piles of take home containers. The dishes and recipes covered the gamut. I liked most of them, didn&apos;t like a few, but overall great place and great experience.",

I have learned so much valuable information from both programs, but the Entreprenurship Program has made me feel like my dream to own/run a reataurant is more acheivable. Currently the program is one day every other week, for five hours. There is no &quot;fluff&quot;, just valuable information, making my trips from San Diego well worth it. Having gone through its Culinary, Apprenticeship, and Entrepreneurship programs, I can confidently say that this school is built to make sure you succeed!

I enjoyed it so much I signed up for other classes. One of the classes I signed up for was the two day bread class ($550). I make bread at home all the time but thought the class could help me level up my skills... 1am the morning of the class my mother called me to inform me my step dad passed away from Covid... I immediately booked a flight to go home to be with my family for 7 am that morning. I emailed culinary lab to let them know I wouldn&apos;t be making it. A week later I reached back out to reschedule my class to the next one a few months later and they informed me I couldn&apos;t reschedule or be reimbursed. I understand why normally last minute cancelations can&apos;t be refunded because food is purchases and can&apos;t be used but this was a bread class... flour salt water and sugar are not meats and fresh veggies that will go bad. I sent them proof that I had booked my flight at 1am that morning and even offered to give them a death certificate to prove it was an emergency.... They were unwilling to accommodate... out of frustration I cancelled all the other classes I had booked.",

Well after a couple weeks of attending classes and getting asked by the professors what I am here for and telling them about golf course management, they said that course ended a couple years ago. So I was lied to, and then was never given proper help for the classes I was now thrown into and was never even helped financially from the school financial aid system. I would recommend to not attend this school, but that&apos;s just my personal opinion",

One of their rooms smell like pee, might be because some kids are in the process of potty training but I&apos;m sure they can have someone clean the carpets. I went in to pick up my girls various times in those 3 days, never were they being taught anything. It was just ladies just watching the kids do their own thing. Wouldn&apos;t recommend this daycare if you&apos;re trying to help your kid learn something. Oh and looked like they get the same snack everyday. When I walked in one morning the kids were eating gold fishes and peaches i don&apos;t know if that was their breakfast or their snack, this was at 8am.",

            "description": "Where to begin...This area is not the best  area in Santa Ana, with high traffic during morning and afternoon hours. Parking is a real problem with this school. Allow yourself enough time to park and wait to be allowed out of the parking lot. You will get trapped in a parking space until an inconsiderate parent that decided to park behind you or outside of the parking stall comes back and decides it&apos;s finally time to leave. (If you know you will be in the school for longer than just a few minutes to drop off/pick up your child, don&apos;t be an idiot and park where you won&apos;t let other parents out.) There are only about 8 parking stalls and some parents will take up two stalls or simply decide not to use them and park behind other cars. This happens every single day. Oh yeah and as another parent mentioned before, if you are a cash customer, you don&apos;t get a receipt for your payment right away. You wait a day or two which has been a problem for me once before. Fortunately it was not a large amount that was unaccounted for so I let it go. Tip: pay the exact amount and pay on time. Other than that, the teachers are really sweet.",

Was not told &quot;apparently&quot; I have to use a specific brand of shampoo... so it&apos;s apparently my fault they sold me default hair. They offered me 15% off my next set.

I dealt with the hair  for at least a month... I had to trim at least 4 inches off   They got super stringy at the ends. And felt like crap.  I&apos;m disappointed. I got talked into this brand instead of hair shop.

When I was looking for art classes, I only found places that had children do very realistic work (often mostly tracing at first), but I wanted to find a class where his creative side would be stimulated. Since he also loves building things, this class is great for him as it combines the best of both worlds, art and architecture. Whether or not your child is interested in architecture, he or she will enjoy the kinds of assignments Natalia makes them do, which appeal to girls and boys alike and have them produce colorful, beautiful, and original work. What my son likes most is that he is encouraged to use his imagination in a way he never gets to during art classes at school.  We&apos;re always amazed at what he brings home. Natalia is great with children of all ages and really encourages my son to do his best. I highly recommend this studio! We gladly drive half an hour to get to this studio every week. Check out their Facebook page or website and you will see the great things children do. They also have classes for older, middle-school aged children that are more directly related to architecture.",

            "description": "I have been coming to this kumon center for the last 4 years. We started because in kindergarten I realized my child was already behind in reading. The progress was really slow in the beginning but by the end of the school year he had caught up &amp; by first grade he surpassed his peers. He is currently in 3rd grade &amp; reads at a 7th grade reading level &amp; can read 169 words in a minute. Not only does he read well but more importantly he understands/comprehends what he is reading. He switched from reading to math in 2nd grade &amp; he is completing 4th grade math currently. \\n\\nMy other son has been doing kumon for 1.5 yrs &amp; just started kindergarten. He took a reading test recently at school &amp; he is already reading at a 1st grade reading level. I think his reading will skyrocket now that he is getting formal instruction in school plus continuing kumon. He is already much more advanced than my first son at the same age because I enrolled him in kumon sooner. I wanted him to be prepared to start school (not like my experience with my first son). \\n\\nLet me say that there is no magic to this system and your results will not come overnight. It takes time, commitment, &amp; patience. Kumon provides structure &amp; accountability for both you &amp; your child. As some have said the staff are young but they are capable of helping your child if they need it. It&apos;s like hiring a high school honors kid to tutor your child, but the point of the program is to get your child to the point they don&apos;t need so much help. My family has had a great experience with this kumon center. If your child is behind, kumon will get them caught up. If your child is advanced, kumon can challenge them. If you want your child to &quot;get ahead&quot;, kumon can do that too!",

The staff would give blinding reports that indicated my niece was performing at a higher level. However, I realized that was not the case after she received state exam reports that were way below the reports of Kumon. I understand that a simply tutoring program will not be enough. But as a working mother who struggles financially, I am disappointed with the results and how the situation was handled when I brought the issue to light. I would recommend looking at different places.",

It is basically a place where they give your kids Math or English Worksheets/Booklets. If you are able to buy the Kumon workbooks and just have your child do them at home then save yourself the time, money and commute. \\n\\nThey basically have your child sit at a desk and do the worksheets. If they need help they ask one of the teenaged assistants to help. The teenagers come and help for a minute and then leave them alone again. The assistants are very young and don&apos;t seem to have any educational training on how to mentor kids or tutor them with positive encouragement/reinforcement. They just come along and correct the child&apos;s mistake with a very bored attitude like someone being forced to help their younger sibling with homework. \\n\\nThe owner was nice till she got me to sign up then she became rude and impatient. She also asked me to pay by cash which I did but found strange. I explained that the teenager who was helping my child was really cold and corrected my child in a shaming way so instead of having a word with her teenage assistant and suggesting alternative methods she told me off and insulted me in front of other parents. Stay away or if you like the drilling style of math then check out the other locations for the program.",

Love how involved all the parents were. My husband loved the father daughter dance. My girls went to Astro Camp 5th grade year they loved it. Loved that the cost to attend Astro Camp was reasonable and we were able to raise funds through PFO to help parents offset some of the expense to attend Astro Camp. Overall awesome experience at Greenville! My only one wish is that they come up with a better system for picking up students cause the line can be ridiculous!",

            "description": "I signed up my son and reserved his spot for when they were still under construction. At the time, it was supposed to open well in advance prior to when I needed to head back to work after my maternity leave ended. As I continued to drive by the facility, I noticed it didn&apos;t look near complete. I reached out in January since I hadn&apos;t heard anything (son was supposed to start in February) and that&apos;s when they told me their opening was delayed with no ETA on completion. I completely understand construction being delayed, however I would have appreciated a courtesy e-mail letting me know about the delay so I could start finding alternatives. Parents of infants know how hard it is to find availability for infants and the long waitlists...It wasn&apos;t going to open in time for my return to work, so I had to find another daycare.\\n\\nI had reached out regarding a refund for my deposit since it wasn&apos;t my fault that I wasn&apos;t enrolling. I received no response, then I got told the director had already changed. The new director responded and let me know she would look into it. She also suggested I just hold onto it if I wanted to enroll him at a later date. We were VERY happy with our current daycare and the lack of communication is what concerned me already. I would have explored them as an option for pre-school, but I never received another follow-up e-mail and wrote several different times. I also called in and left messages and never heard back. I eventually gave up and never received my deposit back.\\n\\nIt&apos;s unfortunate because we live so close, but if their lack of communication and transparency is already a concern...to me it displays their business values and communication is key to me when I&apos;m choosing care for my kids.",

Best part was they have cameras...It made me feel comfortable leaving my son because I would get to monitor him 24/7. Overall the staff was really friendly highly recommend.",

They don&apos;t care about your kids, only about collecting their money. Yes they may have all the bells and whistles but it&apos;s a facade to distract you from the soullessness of this place. \\n\\nMy son was there for a year and during that time it was a revolving door of teachers. Any of the good teachers that were there always left after a short time being there for a better job that paid more somewhere else. Kids need consistency and leadership, this was nowhere to be found in this place. \\n\\nWhen I picked him up, on multiple occasions I witnessed kids watching an iPad in the corner while the teachers cleaned up the classroom. This was also intentionally done outside view of the cameras so parents couldn&apos;t see. SHADY!! Also, no singing, reading, circle time, or any of the &quot;educational&quot; related activities they dupe parents into thinking they provide. \\n\\nIt was so bad at one point they didn&apos;t have any toys or books in the class, until I brought it to the attention of management. The teachers (or lack there of) had all the bookcases that we&apos;re supposed to be filled with toys and activities to play with emptied and turned facing the wall. This was only slightly remedied when I brought it to the attention of management. Really?!? How did they not see it before?? Shameful. \\n\\nThen on top of it all, my son stopped going there when the pandemic started, we paid for a whole week he didn&apos;t go. We took the opportunity to get him out of that school and never look back. We asked for our deposit plus the week we paid and he didn&apos;t go back and they said they couldn&apos;t give it to us!! They even had the audacity to suggest we &quot;transfer it to another family so they can use it and give us the money directly&quot;... uhhh what kind of legitimate business would ever suggest something so ridiculous?!? Bottom line, it&apos;s a deposit, your supposed to give it back. We need our money back, especially during a hard time right now for so many families. We told them this and they couldn&apos;t care less. They were so insensitive it was despicable. \\n\\nBottom line, this place is TERRIBLE!!! DO NOT SEND YOUR KIDS HERE EVER!! They don&apos;t care about you or your kids and the care is questionable. Take my experience as a warning and keep looking for a better place! It&apos;s out there. After we left this place, we found one that&apos;s WAY BETTER and CHEAPER where teachers actually care about the kids and they do sooo many fun activities all the time.",

I thought it would be hard for my son to transition from an in home babysitter, but it&apos;s been amazing! It&apos;s been over 2 months now and I am happy to say I made the right choice. He attends five full days a week and loves to talk about school and the awesome playground. \\nThe teachers and staff are professional, dependable and very caring towards all the kids. They make it a point to know you personally and gives me the peace of mind I need while I am at work.  In addition, the facility is beautiful, well maintained and secure.  Bonus: The parking lot spaces are big and always available.  I am so excited to watch my son grow at this school.",

Mind you, this is only my second daycare (the first being Kiddie Academy of Tustin) but I feel really comfortable with the infant room here. Being a first time mom who suffers from anxiety, I have really struggled to trust anyone with my daughter. After some minor panic attacks while learning to adjust, I&apos;ve gotten really comfortable with the teachers and office personnel. Justine really seems to understand my daughter&apos;s moods and recognizes when she just isn&apos;t being herself... that&apos;s big when you are dealing with an infant. I like that someone else is able to recognize a problem and tell me. She&apos;s confirmed my suspicion of my daughter being slightly off and we found out she had an ear infection. Gemma is just the sweetest, you can tell that she has a lot of experience with kids. Its reassuring to know someone is showing her affection throughout the day, she really thrives on it. I worry slightly less knowing these ladies are watching my little girl. One of my most favoritest things is the pictures and videos they send me on the Tadpole app. I get probably one or more a day, which definitely brightens my day. They understand the small things really matter. For mothers day, there were so many cute little things my daughter was involved in... it wouldn&apos;t have been possible without these wonderful teachers and I will treasure the gifts forever. When it comes to my view on how my daughter does here versus the other Kiddie Academy, I would say she does so much better here... she is thriving. It&apos;s just amazing for her development, the room is wide open with lots of things that interest her. I&apos;m so glad we found this daycare, I definitely recommend Kiddie Academy of Santa Ana!",

The receptionist was very generous with her time and cheerfully gave us a tour during which she explained the history and current objectives of MARC.  She introduced us to team members as we walked thru the various areas.  Staff and volunteers were all very friendly and happy to answer our questions.",

Meredith makes you feel so welcome when you first arrive and is attentive the entire week. The facilities were great and the instructors all knowledgeable and excited to teach. They also do a great job of knowing you came out to Alaska to see the beauty in addition to fly, and have ways of visiting challenging and beautiful lakes, allowing you to do both. My instructor, Sarah, did a great job and I loved each flight. Even when she was chastising me for forgetting something. (often....)\\nThe entire team is great, though. Other instructors are so nice and quick to answer questions, ask you about yourself or provide insight they have picked up. Alex made sure our plane was ready for each and every flight, even fighting an early season snow storm! And the aircraft, while not shiny, new planes, are clearly well cared for by Don and Jason and I felt as safe in them as any I have flown. I really grew to enjoy flying the pacer. \\nThe exam was fair and in no way a gift. Don is very professional in his approach and does a great job making sure his instructors prepare you appropriately and challenges you accordingly. Not sure those pre-checkride jitters will ever go away.... \\nIn short, I can&apos;t recommend this place enough. I am so thankful I had people suggest it to me, and I can&apos;t wait to go back up for some bush flying and a commercial add-on!",

            "description": "I completed a 12-day mountaineering course with AMS last spring; I&apos;d done some entry-level mountaineering in the Pacific Northwest, where I live, and this was my first expedition-style experience.  The trip truly exceeded my expectations.  I found that it was as much about learning to bond with your companions and learning how to live (cook, sleep, relax, appreciate the incredible nature around you) and be comfortable on a glacier for almost two weeks as it was about learning the technical skills including crevasse rescue and sled travel required for a trip like Denali.  It was nice to be eased into this type of environment without being forced to alpine start in the dark at all or exert yourself for really anything more than 8 hours at a time.  Our guides were some of the most hardworking, interesting people I&apos;ve met and even taught us to build an igloo on our &quot;snow day&quot;.  I liked that they emphasized learning independence early on (learning to use the MSR stoves, melting snow for water, planning meals and cooking our own food) opposed to the experience some other groups offer (I&apos;ve been on REI backpacking trips where I&apos;m sitting idly watching the guides cook dinner and don&apos;t prefer that). \\n\\nGiven some of the negative reviews below, I do want to reflect for a minute on expectation setting for a trip such as this.  There are SO many factors outside of our control (weather, pandemic, availability of employees, to name a few) that I think it is a true wonder in the current age that one can sign up for an experience like this at what I found to be a fair price for what was provided (air travel onto glacier, provisions, gear, expert instruction, feeling secure on a guided trip) for nearly two weeks.  I felt that AMS&apos; COVID policies were reasonable and well communicated, and as a healthcare worker I can acknowledge the risk a company takes on flying students of varying states of fitness, health, and age into a remote environment.  I purchased the insurance recommended by AMS just in case.\\n\\n12 days is an extensive amount of time to choose to spend in a remote area, and I have a huge appreciation for the guides who make the sacrifices they do so that people like me can have such a tremendous experience.  Given the stressors in a place like Alaska, I certainly don&apos;t expect dynamics to be perfect at any time, so I was pleasantly surprised by how mature everyone in our group was and by how we got along.  We made some great memories - from the tough times pulling sleds up mountain passes roasting in the sun, to the chill times in camp cooking and &quot;brunching&quot; together, sharing stories.  This trip was the most impactful thing I&apos;ve done in the last decade, hands down.  I look forward to keeping in touch with the folks I met, and to doing another trip with AMS in the future.",

I am a management consultant and a serious mountaineer (doing 4 mountains/ year with multiple international/ local companies) and have never had a worst experience. \\nWe were 6 participants on an expedition to summit Denali on 23-May 2019 and 5 of us had to return one day before the summit because we did not trust our Lead Guide (Con Severis and Second Guide (Chris Welch) to take us to the top due to safety problems as well as horrible/ inhuman client service. All the trip participants are experienced mountaineers and have hired many international and local guide companies. We are all well-versed with safety, service and professionalism standards. The Denali trip did not meet these standards. Below are some high level examples of what we experienced:\\n\\n+Egregious Safety Concerns. There were numerous safety issues that put the participants at risk throughout the expedition.

However, the company refused to refund my deposit even though the contract explicitly states &quot;AMS reserves the right to cancel a Course or Expedition; in this unlikely event, paid deposit and balance will be refunded in full.&quot; \\n\\nAMS argues they are simply postponing to 2021. However, I&apos;m not available to commit to a 2021 date at this time and the contract I signed listed a 2020 departure date. \\n\\nWhile I understand this is a difficult time for small businesses (and I offered to contribute some of my deposit), I don&apos;t think it&apos;s fair for the company to not honor the original contract we mutually signed. \\n\\nWhile I&apos;ve heard AMS has good guides and is great at logistics on Denali, I would not want to be climbing with a company I can&apos;t fully trust.",

            "description": "I had a very bad experience with AMS the summer of 2019 and would strongly recommend you to not go with them if you want to summit Denali. Our lead guide, Con Severis, was constantly yelling, swearing at the entire group, leading while listening to loud music that made it impossible to communicate with him and not providing any instruction/help in critical moments to his rope team.\\n\\nHis behavior was not only highly unprofessional, but he also put us in several dangerous situations. He would become angry if we had a bad weather day and storm down steep hills and even asked another person in our group to untie from the fixed line and go down an icy slope holding only on his ice axe. We felt unsafe numerous times, scared to voice our concerns and felt treated very poorly.\\n\\nWe continued the trip nevertheless because we all wanted to summit. We were a group of 7, one of us had to go back because of frostbite, the remaining 6 of us got very close to last camp before summit at 16,000 feet. That&apos;s when Con told us that he won&apos;t take all of us to summit because there weren&apos;t enough guides. He had decided from day one according to him that only 3 people from our group will summit and now because 6 of us had made it he was going to turn back 3 of us to base camp even if we were feeling great, had no issues and the weather was good. Things went downhill from there and the group lost confidence in the guides&apos; abilities and willingness to lead us to the summit - all of us except one chose to go down and not summit with Con as our guide because we thought it was very risky. It was honestly one of the hardest decisions I had to make in my life being so close to the summit we have been training for.\\n\\nThe responses from the manager and AMS to our complaints have been disappointing - they decided to place the blame on all of us and didn&apos;t even apologize. We are now considering to sue them.\\n\\nPlease feel free to reach out to me, I am happy to share more of my experience. From my experience, the guide company you choose is an important decision given how hard the mountain is and the high price investment. I am very sorry I chose AMS and I will regret this forever but I hope other climbers are aware.",

Meredith makes you feel so welcome when you first arrive and is attentive the entire week. The facilities were great and the instructors all knowledgeable and excited to teach. They also do a great job of knowing you came out to Alaska to see the beauty in addition to fly, and have ways of visiting challenging and beautiful lakes, allowing you to do both. My instructor, Sarah, did a great job and I loved each flight. Even when she was chastising me for forgetting something. (often....)\\nThe entire team is great, though. Other instructors are so nice and quick to answer questions, ask you about yourself or provide insight they have picked up. Alex made sure our plane was ready for each and every flight, even fighting an early season snow storm! And the aircraft, while not shiny, new planes, are clearly well cared for by Don and Jason and I felt as safe in them as any I have flown. I really grew to enjoy flying the pacer. \\nThe exam was fair and in no way a gift. Don is very professional in his approach and does a great job making sure his instructors prepare you appropriately and challenges you accordingly. Not sure those pre-checkride jitters will ever go away.... \\nIn short, I can&apos;t recommend this place enough. I am so thankful I had people suggest it to me, and I can&apos;t wait to go back up for some bush flying and a commercial add-on!",

However, the company refused to refund my deposit even though the contract explicitly states &quot;AMS reserves the right to cancel a Course or Expedition; in this unlikely event, paid deposit and balance will be refunded in full.&quot; \\n\\nAMS argues they are simply postponing to 2021. However, I&apos;m not available to commit to a 2021 date at this time and the contract I signed listed a 2020 departure date. \\n\\nWhile I understand this is a difficult time for small businesses (and I offered to contribute some of my deposit), I don&apos;t think it&apos;s fair for the company to not honor the original contract we mutually signed. \\n\\nWhile I&apos;ve heard AMS has good guides and is great at logistics on Denali, I would not want to be climbing with a company I can&apos;t fully trust.",

            "description": "I had a very bad experience with AMS the summer of 2019 and would strongly recommend you to not go with them if you want to summit Denali. Our lead guide, Con Severis, was constantly yelling, swearing at the entire group, leading while listening to loud music that made it impossible to communicate with him and not providing any instruction/help in critical moments to his rope team.\\n\\nHis behavior was not only highly unprofessional, but he also put us in several dangerous situations. He would become angry if we had a bad weather day and storm down steep hills and even asked another person in our group to untie from the fixed line and go down an icy slope holding only on his ice axe. We felt unsafe numerous times, scared to voice our concerns and felt treated very poorly.\\n\\nWe continued the trip nevertheless because we all wanted to summit. We were a group of 7, one of us had to go back because of frostbite, the remaining 6 of us got very close to last camp before summit at 16,000 feet. That&apos;s when Con told us that he won&apos;t take all of us to summit because there weren&apos;t enough guides. He had decided from day one according to him that only 3 people from our group will summit and now because 6 of us had made it he was going to turn back 3 of us to base camp even if we were feeling great, had no issues and the weather was good. Things went downhill from there and the group lost confidence in the guides&apos; abilities and willingness to lead us to the summit - all of us except one chose to go down and not summit with Con as our guide because we thought it was very risky. It was honestly one of the hardest decisions I had to make in my life being so close to the summit we have been training for.\\n\\nThe responses from the manager and AMS to our complaints have been disappointing - they decided to place the blame on all of us and didn&apos;t even apologize. We are now considering to sue them.\\n\\nPlease feel free to reach out to me, I am happy to share more of my experience. From my experience, the guide company you choose is an important decision given how hard the mountain is and the high price investment. I am very sorry I chose AMS and I will regret this forever but I hope other climbers are aware.",

            "description": "My daughter is a May 2016 BA (theater school).  Comparing her time @ OCU with mine at a LARGE State university, I came to appreciate several specific things about OCU.  First, a culture of Alcohol and Partying is not a factor....it was part and parcel of my undergrad days.  Not that the students don&apos;t drink; i&apos;m not that na\u00efve.  But there is SO much going on on campus (sports, performances of ALL kinds ALL the time) that are considered more &quot;the thing to do&quot;.  Second, the Greek system is chill and not snooty.  There were young ladies who transferred away from my alma mater when they didn&apos;t get the sorority of their dreams, or they stayed and felt left out.  At OCU, any young lady who wants to join a sorority will likely get a bid, and instead of lifelong social climbers, they will get a group of gals from all over the country who will truly &quot;have their back&quot; when they need prof recs, books, a dress for a party, a job lead, etc. Third, for a small school, this school has an inordinate number of events, groups and outings. the SGA itself put together some really cool stuff, as did the different colleges, Greek chapters and sports teams. my daughter just laughed when her friends at a large State U down the road always complained that they had to drive to OKC to have fun.  I was thankful my daughter&apos;s commute to &quot;have fun&quot; didn&apos;t involve late night commutes on an interstate freeway.  Fourth, I was impressed that the student population hails from all over the country.  easily 75% of my prestigious State U colleagues came from within the State, and many of them &quot;disappeared&quot; to return home on weekends.  In notable contrast, my daughter&apos;s friends hailed from Washington state, Washington DC, NJ, the Midwest, FL, MI, so most honestly considered OCU their &quot;home&quot; for 4 years and didn&apos;t &quot;evaporate&quot; over weekends.  Finally, OCU has a great location within a moderately sized Capital City.  the state Capitol is literally down 23rd, which is great for poly sci majors.  the downtown and Bricktown is perhaps 10 min. south of campus; an upscale shopping area is 10 min. NW and the city reservoir, Lake Hefner, is 20 min. NW and has a 10 mi. jogging trail.   All of these destinations can be reached on city streets (vs freeways) so traffic is largely a non-issue.   Basically, OCU is a nurturing school with rigorous academics that provides kids the opportunity to really get to know their schoolmates.  I have never worked for OCU and indeed had a few &quot;conversations&quot; about some of their policies.  but all in all, my daughter is a proud grad and I am a very happy parent who feels she got the right values from this university.",

Swanson Elementary will be on your left. The school board office is nestled down behind the Elementary school.",
