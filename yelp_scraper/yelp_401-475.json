The latest time, she was teamed up on by a few other girls for being too loud and interrupting, something I had explained to the teacher she has a hard time controlling. When she verbally warned one of the other kids to stop, they sent her home for the rest of the week with no further warning, or remedial action. Surely, a kids words shouldn&apos;t be cause enough for expulsion, especially when they are only responding to organized criticism from the other kids. We will never, ever subject our kid to this kind of elitist environment again. And it is too bad, since there really isn&apos;t another theater option for kids in Huntsville.

We always joked that if you leaned in closely enough to the cinder walls you could still hear the servers saying &quot;Serve you, Serve you please?!?!?!&quot; :D\\n\\nBecause high school was such a breeze for me and really did not prepare me for college, I started UAH with a whopping 1.0 and yes, academic probation my first semester. I had no idea you could drop a class and really did *not* think the professors meant what they said when they assigned voluminous amounts of reading/coursework with only a day or so to accomplish it, and I paid for it with terrible grades my first semester.\\n\\nEnter Calhoun! Calhoun to the rescue! I took classes all over north Alabama or at least it felt like it with part time college professors and full time ones, too. Anyway, it was still hard work; however the staff were friendlier than UAH, more accommodating to those of us who worked, and had more of a smaller, diverse group of students. I still learned and I learned a LOT at Calhoun!\\n\\nI managed to pull my grades up to graduate with two associates at cum laude and transfer back to UAH to do the same with 1 BA cum laude.\\n\\nThe tip for anyone planning to do a similar approach to getting a degree is to stay in touch with UAH and ensure each class and associated credit *will* transfer from Calhoun to UAH. To me, and I&apos;m sure to any college student, these hours are pretty much worth gold and you don&apos;t want to lose them! Also, don&apos;t be afraid to take any issues where a credit is denied to the Dean (or higher if necessary) to argue your case. Pay attention to the handbooks (if that&apos;s a thing anymore) and ensure the classes align in terms of course content.\\n\\nOh, and another good thing about Calhoun is you don&apos;t rack up 1000s of parking tickets by attending there.\"},{\"author\":\"Marisa G.\",\"datePublished\":\"2014-09-27\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":1},\"description\":\"Don&apos;t use the vending machines...ever.

SJKP offers curbside drop off and pick up.  If this is convenient for you, great.  If, however, you are like me and enjoy walking your child into his/her classroom and getting them settled before hugging and kissing them goodbye for the day, you will be discouraged from doing so.  Although I was told during my tour that &quot;parents are always welcome in the classroom,&quot; I was asked by the teacher to say my goodbyes outside the door and not come in (this was also later formalized in a memo from the director to all parents).  When you pick up and drop off your child this way (in a rush at the curb with a line of other parents waiting), you get no feedback from your child&apos;s teacher(s) about his or her day and no real opportunity to communicate your own questions, concerns or comments.  I felt alienated and found it very dismaying and distressing.  \\n\\n2. Nap time policy is that children do not have to sleep, but if they do not sleep, they are expected to rest quietly on their mats with no toys, books, or other distractions for approximately two hours (I don&apos;t know any adults that could do this with no phone, book, tv, etc, let alone a two-year-old).  My child is not a napper.  We struggled with this the whole time he was there.  If I didn&apos;t ask if he napped, no one told me.  They waited until it was so bad (he was yelling, kicking walls, and causing a major ruckus) to tell me on a Friday that he would not be welcome back for naptime starting Monday.  There is no alternative available to a non-napper.\\n\\n3.  During summer session, they rotated teachers every couple of weeks so leadership was very inconsistent for my child.  They were loose on the &quot;rules&quot; so when the school session started in August, we had to overcome two and a half months of letting certain things go, then backtrack to reestablish what would be expected of him.\\n\\n4. Because I was discouraged from entering the classroom, I had no idea who my child&apos;s classmates were, and I rarely had the chance to meet any other parents.  \\n\\n5. This school&apos;s philosophy is very centered on obedience.  When a child is &quot;disobedient,&quot; he/she is sent to the director&apos;s office.  My son told me once (and remember, this is a two year old!), that &quot;Mrs. [director&apos;s name] was very angry to me.&quot;  I found this attitude to be very unrealistic for such young children, and that it limited creativity and independence.  \\n\\nI removed my son from this facility after approximately four months.\"},{\"author\":\"Kalle C.\",\"datePublished\":\"2018-03-22\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":1},\"description\":\"This school was recommended by another good school so I figured it would be ok.

I was told the school was full.... weird that when I came just two weeks prior they said they had all the space available. Mind you I am a South American man of color &amp; of course my child is also of color. Now I kind of see why they weren&apos;t an abundance of &quot;minorities&quot; in their school.

Mika was extremely helpful in helping me organize my thoughts and providing invaluable information. This information probably saved me thousands of dollars in the long run!\\n\\nAlthough she doesn&apos;t have as much prior experience in the fashion industry, she took the time to listen and quickly learned some key points about my industry. She was able to translate her previous knowledge within various other industries and apply them to my immediate business needs. \\n\\nIn our first session, she helped me figure out a timeline to move forward quickly and efficiently. We worked on my business plan and mission statement to make it clear and concise. Mika is a wiz when it comes to wording and editing. She is definitely someone you want on your team when trying to make sure that your branding is consistent and will capture your target customer. \\n\\nFor the second session, we focused on narrowing down the number of options for collection development with data, feedback, and perspective. Mika helped me make the best decision for my brand identity and target customer. We were able to narrow down the sketches from 12 to 4. Narrowing the sketches allowed me to move forward into the sample-making stage of production with my manufacturer. The decided looks will help me to have a cohesive launch collection while also staying true to my brand aesthetic. \\n\\nOur third session primarily focused on the budget. During the start-up period, having your accounts in order is crucial. We were able to lay out a budget and allocate costs to make sure that funding was going to the essential parts of the business. Establishing a budget has helped me bypass problems that most new business owners encounter. I saved money and focused my efforts on sample making and construction/fit, which are very important for a successful fashion brand. \\n\\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed working with Mika. It was easy to articulate my visions and goals for the business. She was friendly and made the sessions feel personal like we&apos;ve been working together for years. I admire her dedication to learning, and she even went above and beyond and learned the industry lingo so she could integrate it into our sessions. I can&apos;t wait to launch!

I cannot tell you how amazing it is for your four year old to come home eager to show you the art project they completed, or excited to teach you new words in Mandarin. Their language program is really something to be proud of, not only is my son learning a third language (Mandarin) but he practices his Spanish and English at the school as well.

They are warm, friendly, loving, and make the children feel comfortable and confident. Some of the schools I visited where clearly more profit motivated and thus focused less on quality staff and its plainly obvious. \\n\\nI noticed also that while other schools had some peripheral fluff to attempt to hide their deficiencies La Piazza focuses solely on the good of the child and not on giving parents bragging rights to meaningless things other schools place front and center as sparkly stuff for gullible parents. \\n\\nThe school is community focused and works with the children and parents to give back. Recently there was a group of parents and children that fed the homeless in downtown miami, spending half a day preparing, heating, packaging and distributing food. \\n\\nNO other school I visited offered DAILY Mandarin (Chinese) classes from a fluent Chinese native for 1 hour per day. Even further, they have an after school program 2 x week for an additional hour of Mandarin, bringing my childs total to 7 hours per week and 28 hours per month of immersive Mandarin which forces both sides of his brain to develop.\\n\\nThe playground is inviting, open air, safe, has fans and soft mulch padding for those unavoidable falls every kid experiences. \\n\\nThe security is top notch with both the main door and secondary door only accessible once being buzzed in from a front desk assistant. \\n\\nThe location couldn&apos;t be safer, on a side street with minimal traffic usually with no cars traveling more than 25-30 miles per hour. Some of the school I visited had their playgrounds next to a high traffic road with many cars traveling over 50 MPH and the only thing spearing a potentially off course car and the kids is a thin wooden or metal chain link fence. Never have I seen a more blatant disregard for basic physical safety than this. Having cars traveling at high speeds next to playground is not exactly intelligent in my opinion. \\n\\nFurthermore, since it&apos;s located in the heart of Merrick Park there is always an Coral Gables Police officer no more than 30 seconds away plus the Police stating is no more than 60 seconds away driving time. The fire station is next to the police station so also another 60 seconds in case of an emergency. Plus all the teachers/staff are trained in CPR. \\n\\nSome of the schools I visited didn&apos;t have adequate outdoor play areas, and the ones that did often felt cold and uninviting. \\n\\nThe educators are continuously trained in the most advanced teaching techniques that allow them to help each child progress at her/his own pace. \\n\\nAll the kids where uniforms and fridays they where whatever they wish, with children being aloud to wear superhero capes and fun outfits. \\n\\nEach classroom feels more like a home living room environment than a class room letting the kids feel cozy and playful while learning. \\n\\nMy child has blossomed since starting here and the only downside is that they only allow him to attend 1 more year, I wish I could keep him here for his early childhood. \\n\\nThere is so much more I could write, but I think this covers some of the most important points. \\n\\nAll around A++ this school should be a model for the other schools in Miami.\"},{\"author\":\"June A.\",\"datePublished\":\"2014-05-02\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":2},\"description\":\"I heard about this place so went for a quick tour.

I am very happy on how she transitioned to her new school. The reviews we get from her new teacher compliment my daughter&apos;s readiness both academically and emotionally, which we attribute greatly to role of her LPA teachers and the school overall. I appreciate very much that they take each child very seriously; my daughter has multiple food and environmental allergies and they were very careful and proactive to help care for her. The program and teaching style is the biggest highlight of LPA. The program includes a daily Mandarin lesson, art and music classes. Also, LPA makes staff professional development a priority and I believe that translates on how well the teachers do their jobs.The environment overall is very loving and supportive. My daughter also participated in most of the after school activities, which are very diverse. They have a great art program, Mandarin and several sports. Parent involvement can be as much or as little as each parent is willing to do. There is an annual holiday show, art show, charity events, among others. Parent-teacher communication is very open. Something that I miss a lot now that my daughter is at a &apos;big girl&apos; school are the weekly bulletins that parents receive every Monday as a review of the past week, which are a great tool to inform parents of what&apos;s going on in the classroom.

The low student to teacher ratio is a huge plus, and all classrooms have a qualitifed teacher and co-teacher, who undergo continuing education and training.  The classrooms provided enough outlets for my son and the school has an amazing outdoor playground and space where play and learning take place.    I would also say that the facility is safe and secured. I would urge parents to tour the school and meet the staff.

Kumon is a brute-force approach to developing memorization skills. On the surface it will seem that the kids are learning, but what they are really doing is memorizing without understanding. For example, your child may learn in Kumon how to spell, read and write the word &quot;dog&quot; 100% of the time because he memorized it by practicing it 200 times. Now if you ask him to write the word &quot;papa&quot; he will not know where to start because is not in his memory bank. However, if they UNDERSTAND how letters sound and make words, they should be able to think and CREATE the word &quot;papa&quot; as it sounds. See the difference?  Kumon is a temporary illusion of learning, it will push your child away from thinking and problem solving.  If you insist for Kumon, you can save the monthly fee and just buy the same worksheets and do it at home. The Kumon &quot;instructors&quot; do exactly the same thing you do with your child at home, watching the kids do the worksheets and correct them. They don&apos;t teach anything.\"},{\"author\":\"Pilar G.\",\"datePublished\":\"2010-06-11\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"Its been 1 1/2 years since my boys started Kumon.  I started them with reading and then after six months decided to add the math to their schedule.   It is amazing to see how Kumon has helped them at school.  When it comes to reading and math, they rarely have to study for a test, they are so much more far advanced than their class.  Boys in my 8 year old&apos;s class are struggling with multiplication and my son is already starting division.  Enough said about Kumon, I need to mention that the owner and director of Kumon of So. Miami needs a mention in this review.  When my oldest boy went through a face and started telling me he didn&apos;t want to do math anymore because he didn&apos;t need it, I mentioned it to Mrs. Chamizo, she suggested a conference between the three of us. After speaking with her, not only did he not quit, he took on more pages in math.  He was doing 5 pages a day and left with ten.  He had already achieved advanced honors in reading and also wanted to achieve this in math.  She has the ability to bring the best out of your child and I&apos;m grateful to have met her and that my children are part of Kumon of So. Miami.  As long as we&apos;re able, they will attend Kumon, I foresee them doing this while in college as well.  I can go on and on talking about how wonderful they are, but even the teachers at school know which of the children in her class go to Kumon, these children feel great about themselves and proud that they are looked up to by their class.

We recently left to enter the more traditional public school environment, but my daughter was very prepared for kindergarten as a result of her time at Gables Montessori - from the independent thinking approach of Montessori instruction to the knowledgable teachers who delivered the lessons, I could not have asked for more. My daughter would consistently apply what she learned at home - from practicing words to wanting to lay out a mat on the floor for every home activity.  They also have real world activities, for example learning the ABCs required bringing an object in to demonstrate each letter, which was fun and helped us to supplement her learning.  They also have some activities which are different from other schools in the area - for example they have regular Mandarin language classes.  I also feel that they really focus on providing value to the family - not just collecting tuition payments. Other schools seem to place a lot of pressure on families to attend too many events and bring in food and supplies, but here they strike the right balance.  Ms. Maderlene really cares about her students and her families and bends over backwards to make sure the needs of every student are met, and the teachers are wonderful and truly take care of each child.

But perhaps the most popular landmark here, aside from the enthralling McLane Stadium, is the memorial statue of Robert Griffin lll. \\n\\nThis stunning replica of Baylor&apos;s diamond jewel features a life sized statue of Robert in his all too familiar stance.

A great school and conservative...which I liked.\\n\\nSo when a friend whose son was attending Baylor encouraged us to go to a spring premiere in my daughter&apos;s junior year we tagged along not knowing what to expect.  It was a full day of experiencing Baylor for prospective students and an opportunity to see the campus and meet students and faculty members.  Being my first trip to Waco,  I was very impressed!  I was totally won over by the beauty of the campus and the positive feeling of the student volunteers and faculty members that I met.\\n\\nEncouraged by our friend to apply although the tuition was daunting but generally reasonable for a private university...she continued to tell us that generous scholarships were offered to exceptional students but to apply early before all the resources were exhausted.  We took her advice and sure enough my daughter got the best scholarship they offered...next to a full ride!  After doing the math my wife and I agreed that it was doable and left the ball in our daughter&apos;s court.\\n\\nI don&apos;t think she had to think too long and too hard and her decision was made.\\n\\nAfter experiencing 2 years of Baylor and Waco; as a parent,  I must say the school is everything you would expect a great university to be!  The facilities are amazing!  And the feeling you get when you walk around the campus is indescribable.  One of feeling your child is in a good place and getting connected in a christian environment that encourages excellence!\\n\\nDeciding on a school for your child can be stressful but I must say in this case it felt so right.  \\n\\nSo for those parents who have given Baylor a thought I would say visit the campus during one of the fall or spring premieres and meet the student volunteers and faculty members and ask questions.  Also soak in the beauty of the Baylor campus....especially the new stadium, science building, student life center and the amazing Armstrong Browning Library!  I guarantee you will walk away impressed!\\n\\nA great buy with great scholarships!\"},{\"author\":\"Greg R.\",\"datePublished\":\"2016-10-18\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"Baylor University was everything a college experience should be and more... \\n\\nAcademics are top notch.

Baylor has a strong Greek system along with a plethora of student organizations to become involved with. Whether you go to Baylor or somewhere else, get involved! The leaderships opportunities along with the opportunity to make new friends all makes for an incredibly positive college experience. And, of course, it&apos;s fun to be involved.\\n\\nThe friends you&apos;ll make will be with individuals of the highest caliber.

My review and experiences are based on visiting the campus as a &quot;Bear-in-law&quot; with my wife, class of 2007. Baylor catches your eye as soon as it comes into view driving on I-35. The whole campus is composed of classic brick building with small steeples and towers protruding into the subdued skyline. I loved touring the campus with my wife and taking in the sights and sounds of a vibrant college campus. One thing that I feel makes the campus especially walkable and visually appealing is the prolific use of parking garages. Baylor utilizes attractive brick multi-level parking garages to offer ample parking while at the same time condensing the size of campus and thereby avoids the creation of asphalt wastelands.\\n\\nOur last trip was during Homecoming 2014 weekend. The whole campus was decorated with signs and murals for the occasion. We attended some of the weekend events, and especially enjoyed the Friday night which included a pep rally followed by fireworks and a massive bonfire.\"},{\"author\":\"Belem P.\",\"datePublished\":\"2018-02-19\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":1},\"description\":\"I was accepted to Baylor as a transfer student and began researching everything I needed to know. I made sure everything was in order so that it would be an easy transition upon arriving. Since I was placed on some waiting list for payments because of financial aid, I was stuck going to orientation the week before classes started and on move-in day. Up to the day before we went down to Waco, I was told that I had been assigned to a dorm room and that I didn&apos;t need to worry about tuition as my scholarships and financial aid would cover everything except my books and maybe the meal plan. \\n\\nI arrived for orientation and a man working at the registration check-in was rude to my mom and I. He said he wouldn&apos;t be helping me and called someone else over. I received my bag with a book assignment for the school year along with other information. I was asked what program I had been accepted\u200b into and was told where to go from there. I went to the assigned auditorium for the pre-health program and while the information was interesting, there were a few questions I wanted to ask but did not get to during the Q&amp;A session. We were told to line up and that we could ask one question each. I lined up and the woman answering our questions skipped over another student and me\u200b. Both of us are minorities and we were the only ones that were skipped and ignored. We were told by the woman that she was done and that we could ask our advisors. \\n\\nI went to advising and signed up for classes. The advisor was very lovely and when I told her what happened, she said she knows about that woman and her attitude towards people not like her.\\n\\nWe were going to lunch but someone recommended getting my student ID. I went and filled out a short form only to be told that I needed to get some paperwork from FA to prove that I could go ahead and get my ID picture taken. I went to FA and they wanted me to pay at least $3,000 then and there. I was not prepared for that. We were told to contact our bank and thankfully we had the money and paid it. Apparently, I was only going to be provided with most of the scholarships from FA if I did exceptionally well during my first semester and then it was all based on\u200b the rest of my time at Baylor. So if I kept my grades up and didn&apos;t mess up, my scholarships would kick in. Sherry or Sherryl was very rude and condescending\u200b towards me for not knowing this despite being in communication\u200b\u200b with FA the whole summer and never being told any of this. I have the e-mails to prove it. After all that trouble, we went to have my ID photo taken but decided to go get our lunch instead since the line for the ID was longer than before. \\n\\nWe went to lunch and they were done. No lunch for us despite having the lunch ticket. We were hungry and not happy with how everything was turning out.\\n\\nI went to go see \u200bthe dorm room and guess what? There was a mishap at the housing office and they did not have a room assignment for me. I was there and someone else had been assigned that room. I was given a  list of hotels I could stay at and possible housing around campus. I showed them the letter and e-mails where I had been assigned a dorm room. After a stressful amount of waiting while someone found out what happened, they found me a dorm. However\u200b the roommate wasn&apos;t too happy because she was supposedly paying for a single dorm room. She didn&apos;t let me in and immediately went to complain about the situation. My family told me not to leave my\u200b belongings in the dorm because she might do something to them. \\n\\nWe went to the bookstore and bought Baylor trinkets before heading over to get my ID photo and missed the information sessions in the afternoon because we were still trying to get everything situated. Something was going on with my information and I was sent back to the FA office where I was told that we needed to call back the bank. At this point, \u200bwe have just about had it and an argument started between my mom and the FA people. Apparently, \u200bthey don&apos;t accept money from our bank so they needed something from them and being the weekend that was not possible. It didn&apos;t make sense to us and they did not do a good job of explaining or showing us any of this in writing. My dad wasn&apos;t willing to use his credit card and found it strange that they couldn&apos;t accept our money when they were more than willing to accept it before.\\n\\nI returned my stuff to the bookstore and took off after the roommate called to threaten me. Baylor&apos;s response was for me to stay at a hotel or look for an apartment. It&apos;s unacceptable\u200b. Halfway back home, I received several calls and messages asking about me not being at orientation. They didn&apos;t sign me in and didn&apos;t believe I was there or what had happened. I have\u200b the bag and book. Almost a week later, I got somewhat of an apology. The bookstore staff and advisors were more understanding and showed more concern.\\n\\nI transferred\u200b and graduated from SMU instead.

As someone whose attended more than a few colleges, I found MCC to be head and shoulders above its four-year counterparts.  Firstly, in my experience, professors here are much more student-centered: many offer generous office hours and seem to be attuned especially to students with busy work lives (instead of neglecting students for the sake of conducting research and other personal interests).  Additionally, whenever I needed assistance, it was always easy to track down the appropriate personnel and I wasn&apos;t given the bureaucratic run-around.  \\n\\nI can&apos;t even begin to imagine the sheer number of students and the range of needs support staff must meet but they&apos;ve always been extremely helpful to me. In fact, a few have gone above and beyond the call in terms of financial aid help, finding work-study opportunities for me and cultivating my interests outside of academics.  \\n\\nClasses are also smaller: no need to endure Calculus or Physics in a cavernous lecture hall with hundreds of students when you might have 15 other students with you here.  Courses are also substantially cheaper here so if you&apos;re diligent and plan your courses/transfer path carefully, you could save a fortune.

The staff/students were friendly, but not professional at all. So much gossiping, joking around, singing and basically I felt like I was just one of those mannequin heads they practice on. Seems like the students should be taught when you make a mistake you don&apos;t announce it for all to hear but instead go find your instructor and quietly tell them what you did wrong. It doesn&apos;t make the customer feel confident about the service they are receiving. The young lady that first introduced herself to me was very sweet but really unsure of herself which is understandable. There were two students working on coloring my hair and neither had a clue as to what they were doing. The instructor left them to their own devices and when she did come back she had to take over because the bleach had been on for quite a while and she had to correct their mistakes. I don&apos;t really blame the students because they didn&apos;t really seem to have a lot of instruction. It took over four hours for them to do my hair and since they were closing they didn&apos;t get to the cut. The color didn&apos;t achieve what was intended but I didn&apos;t really expect it to. But I am pleased with the results. The instructor seems to know her stuff and ended up doing the majority of my color.

The school can be much better than it is if they just played to their strengths. While UCA has very strong and well-rounded Chemistry and Physics departments (some of the best in the state, in my opinion), they tend to focus their interests in Football and Business. While this is their main constituency in numbers, I feel that this is a fatal move that can keep this school focusing on the less relevant features of a top-notch school. The recent donation to the Lewis Science Center from Conway Corp and the recent large acquisitions of research funding by the departments should stand as an extreme message to Tom Courtway that the real substance of a successful school is in its academia and not its sports. This is why UCA receives 4 out of 5 from me. \\n\\nThere&apos;s a lot of potential for this school in the sciences. The science departments have top-notch professors that are sending students off to graduate school at places like Harvard, Cornell, Georgia-Tech, Penn State and other high quality graduate schools. It just feels like no one is noticing the extreme achievements of these professors and missing a grand opportunity to capitalize on UCA&apos;s true strengths. Get with it, Mr. Courtway. You have an excellent opportunity with these professors. A great school is built off of strong science and academia, not sports. This is where UCA should be sinking its money.\\n\\nBut, as I am graduating soon, I appreciate the opportunities afforded to me at this university.

I&apos;m a little arrogant about it, truth be told. I can follow complex recipes, I&apos;m confident enough to add my own stank to them, I&apos;m consistently able to impress my friends. And one of the things I&apos;ve been making the longest is bread. My mom taught me when I was five. She never used a recipe and always started with a five-pound bag of all-purpose flour. Thanks to Melinda&apos;s classes, I cringe thinking about it now, not because I suddenly don&apos;t love my mom, but because I thought I knew how to make bread but it turns out, I&apos;m Jon Snow.\\n\\nLet me explain. \\n\\nWe&apos;ve been lied to. Me, you, my mom...all of us. Melinda busted so many myths about dough and yeast and bread recipes in the space of one afternoon, I sincerely lost count. I was genuinely gobsmacked and remember asking more than once, &quot;Wait...really?!&quot; And this wasn&apos;t even the Fundamentals class, it was the bagel making one! \\n\\nI could go on forever about Melinda and her wonderful classes, the comfortable space, and the post-class support. However, there&apos;s probably a character limit on these things and I want to get to the most important reasons you should take Melinda&apos;s classes: there is nothing--and I can&apos;t emphasize this enough because Yelp won&apos;t let me bold words--NOTHING to compare to being taught in-person by an expert baker like Melinda. This ain&apos;t YouTube, baby. If you mess up your brioche dinner roll ball, Melinda is right there with her hand over yours, telling you to close your eyes so you can concentrate on the right technique. And, poof! Perfect little balls of dough are born. If you&apos;re not sure how exactly to wrap the dough rope around your hand to get that traditional double twist bagel shape, don&apos;t worry, she&apos;ll give you homemade play-dough (get it?) to practice on.  \\n\\nAnd here&apos;s honestly the coolest, most fun, most worth-it part of the whole experience: anyone can do it. No matter if you&apos;ve never baked before, Melinda walks you through every step with easy-to-follow instructions and the next thing you know, you&apos;ve produced photo-worthy bread. Seriously. You&apos;ll leave absolutely amazed that you now have this magical ability to make something that tastes better than anything store-bought, and it didn&apos;t require a Ph.D. in chemistry.\\n\\nI&apos;ve taken two classes so far and I plan to take all the rest of them.

We learned the tricks of dough handling and forming of the baguettes and then, while they were rising before the bake, we mixed and kneaded our own dough to take home.  While our baguettes were baking, the &apos;class&apos; (on this day it was just 3 of us) enjoyed a glass of wine under the shade trees in her garden until we were treated to a truly lovely &apos;snack&apos; of the bread we had just made accompanied by an amazing assortment of cheeses, meats and homemade spreads Melinda had prepared (an my wife is adamant to get a recipe or two from that!) \\n\\nIt was a wonderful afternoon and actually great &apos;date&apos; for this old married couple (43 years), we highly recommend it, and worth every single penny.\\n\\nLastly, let me say this: I have been trying to make a decent baguette for 2 or 3 years from reading books, internet recipes, including Cook&apos;s Illustrated, America&apos;s Test Kitchen and Ina Garten, etc.  I&apos;ve followed ridiculously complex recipes, some requiring messing with the dough every 30 minutes for 5-6 times in row and all manner of nonsense,  Melinda&apos;s method is the simplest and most straightforward of any I&apos;ve tried.  And the baguettes are as good as any I&apos;ve ever tasted,(FYI,  I have eaten baguettes in France, Belgium and Spain) lightly crisp crust with wonderful chewiness and the crumb is airy with marvelous holes that you read about, lol. \\n\\nAnyway...

Since then, Ms. Contractor has given me the run around about my son&apos;s acceptance.  Despite repeated phone calls and emails, I still don&apos;t know whether or not my son is accepted here (today&apos;s date is 4/16/2021).

That said, the fact that she is incapable of having a mature, adult conversation with me about why my son is denied is concerning.  If she can&apos;t have that conversation with me (a parent she barely knows), can we trust she is able to do so with her employees when they aren&apos;t meeting expectations or standards?\\nTheir Assistant Principal, Carly, has been CC&apos;d on all communications as well, and has been silent.  She has not once intervened or stepped up to resolve the communication gap.    \\nI had to speak to an Admissions Coordinator, just to have my concerns emailed to the Regional Director in hopes of possibly hearing back from that person.

She also gave us the address and explained to us how to get there and where to park.\\n\\nI parked in a public garage for $5.00, this was not my best choice, because I&apos;m not used to walking alone downtown, but it wasn&apos;t that bad after all.\\n\\nI went into the Sun-trust building, a beautiful tall building. The academy is on the 22nd floor as Nicole told us in her email.\\n\\nOnce I got there, we went to this room where she had everything set up as you can see in my pictures, so pretty and organized. That&apos;s one of the most important things for me, how well organized and neat everything was.

As an indie film not backed with million in advertisement dollars, only a few theaters showed the somewhat controversial &quot;Lovelace&quot;, one of those locations being the Koubek Center. I have never been to the Koubek Center but only heard of it sporadically here and there, and learned about it more recently when I was invited for the reopening of the newly furbished facilities. \\n\\nWhen I got to the Koubek Center I was very surprised. The grounds were simply gorgeous. I parked my car in the private parking lot and walked around. Well, I did more than that. I thoroughly explored the site. This MDC facility used to be a mansion and gardens, a sort of memorial build by the late John James Koubek to his wife, Rose Garibaldi Koubek. He was a real estate investor who became a benefactor and philanthropist, and who later gifted the mansion to the University of Miami to make it the home of the Cuban Cultural Center (now defunct), hosting it for decades. The mansion itself is enclosed by a fence, and surrounded by tall trees and lawns. The grounds are not large enough to be a estate, but large enough to house a gazebo among other things. Currently, the Mediterranean style mansion serves as offices and classrooms, theater, movie theater, museum, conference room, etc., but more importantly, it is the house to Teatro Prometeo, a Hispanic flavored theater troupe. \\n\\nAt the time of this review, the center is housing The Tower Theater and its patrons. Since The Tower Theater is closed for renovations, a light schedule is en place to accommodate those who can&apos;t live without the schedule of movies featured at The Tower Theater. For this function, The Koubek Center has fitted the newly renovated theater with a medium sized screen. I do find the screen to be annoyingly small, but I am thinking of a large megaplex  monster screen. For the showings that I have attended, everything has been perfectly fine, and I guess the small screen will do in the meantime. The sound, on the other hand, is really good, as well as the sitting.\\n\\nThe Koubek Center also offers small yet important and serious theater plays. Also, they feature dance shows and music concerts. A word of caution: The Koubek Center is inclined to offer the more underground art scene, showcasing Hispanic authors and artists, and consequently, Latin American themes. It&apos;s definitely not Broadway, but it is very educational.\\n\\nParking for the daytime functions is free, but there is a charge for night time showings.\"},{\"author\":\"Naty K.\",\"datePublished\":\"2014-04-15\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":4},\"description\":\"The Koubek Center, a former mansion, is a great place for getting exposure to cultural events.  Located off of 27th Street in the Little Havana neighborhood, it is a cultural and historical landmark in South Florida, currently operated by Miami Dade College.  Apparently, the mansion and grounds are available for touring, but when I came, it was close to night time, so I did not have a chance to do that, nor take any photographs.  It looks beautiful though.  I used to drive by all the time not knowing what this was, and frankly, it looks out of place considering the other nearby establishments, like a drug store and a Lincoln-Marti daycare.  Parking at the Koubek Center, inside a gated lot on the back with a roaming security guard, was free, which was convenient.    \\n\\nAs I mentioned, this is a cultural center, hosting workshops, lectures, and the Art Cinema.  Although most events may be geared toward the Hispanic and Cuban cultures, I came for The Big Read, which celebrated Asian cultures, the Indian culture, to be more specific.  The Big Read this year featured events and activities inspired by The Namesake by Jhumpa Lahiri, including a flash mob-style Bhangra dance party, film screenings, book discussions, author presentations, Indian cooking demos and tastings, and more.  Unfortunately, because all those interesting events took place during the week, I was unable to attend, but I was able to attend the last event of the series, which was a screening of &quot;The Namesake&quot; movie, and in addition, we got a free copy of the book.  By the way, I highly recommend this movie, it&apos;s very realistic and offers a view into growing up Indian in America.\\n\\nThe theater inside was comfortable, small, yet cozy.  The screen was of a decent size, and there was a stage, which I assume is where book discussions are held.  All the staff was polite and welcoming.  It was a small, intimate event, and I enjoyed it.  I felt as if I was part of a private, secret movie screening.  I definitely would be open to watching more movies here, dance performances, whatever.  I wish we had more indie films, it seems the indie films are only held in Boca Raton and Delray Beach, which is frustrating when you live in Miami.  Considering we have an art museum now, I think it&apos;s time people got exposed to other cultures and indie films from other countries.  I hope the Koubek Center listens, it&apos;d make a great venue for hosting such films!\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":4.5,\"reviewCount\":4}}"]},

This book fair is held annually at Miami Dade College Wolfson Campus and had been since I attended years ago when I went to Miami Dade College Wolfson from 2001 to 2003. \\n\\nBack then I attended Miami Dade College when I was there as part of the High School I was enrolled in called the School for Advanced Studies (SAS). For those of you unfamiliar with SAS, it is a Miami Dade Public High School which is located in various different Miami Dade College Campuses including the Wolfson Campus. It was and I am sure still is an amazing high school which allowed me to take college courses in the morning and then advanced placement high school courses in the afternoon. I didn&apos;t not need to be bused back to a high school like a normal dual-enrollment program as the high school is located inside Miami Dade College. If you have a son or daughter who are in 9th or 10th grade, then check out the program. When I graduated from SAS I had 55 college credits.... just shy of an associates degree. It is an extraordinary opportunity to be able to receive an associates degree out of college or transfer to a four year university almost as a junior... especially when you consider that the most expensive classes and books in a four year degree are the classes in your first two years. Here is the website: http://www.mdc.edu/main/sas/ \\n\\nIt was thanks to the skills and knowledge I received at SAS and Miami Dade College that helped me become the man I am today. I went on to first get a bachelors degree (the first in my family to do so) and then get two masters degrees (again the first in my family to do that as well).

It is clear that there has been a recent and concerted effort to make the college at once more accessible, and to also make it more academically rigorous and respected.  Given the increase in population in the southern counties, MDC is a great resource for people to get a quality education at a reasonable price, especially if your goal is a 4-year degree.  The &quot;Pathway&quot; degree programs at MDC are excellent, getting you all you need for 2 of 4 years required toward a Bachelor&apos;s Degree.  All at a bargain price, and easily transferrable anywhere in the Florida State university system (and beyond, with varying requirements). \\nThere are 3 issues:\\n1.  The instructors are not universally good, although quite a few I&apos;ve encountered are outstanding.  The best instructors are there because they care about being educators, and are excellent.  They are there because they want to be, because most instructors are &apos;Adjunct Professors&apos; and are paid very poorly.  Finding out who a good instructor (and it won&apos;t be the one who gives the least homework or easiest projects) is key to getting the most out of the experience.  Paying more for more consistent quality instruction is the ultimate answer.  For now, find out a bit about who&apos;s teaching a class before final enrollment.  It makes a difference.\\n2.  Some of the students seem to be there because their parents might otherwise might make them get a job.  If you&apos;re doing a project and it&apos;s clear your fellow-student doesn&apos;t care, drop them.  Don&apos;t let your grade suffer because someone else isn&apos;t dedicated to getting the education being offered.  You&apos;re there for an education, so do yourself a favor and get the most out of it by hanging with others of the same mindset.\\n3.

I don&apos;t want to knock the other daycares in Brickell because they are fine, we toured them all and even had the 4 year old in one for a while, but Champs is absolutely on a league of its own.\\n\\nThe first thing I&apos;d like to mention is that Champs will give your little one the most important thing they need in their lives at an early age, lots of love and affection.  The teachers at Champs have become family to us, at this point it feels like I&apos;m dropping off my kids at grandma&apos;s house where a team of loving aunts are waiting to pour affection on them while my wife and I are at work.\\n\\nMs. Isabel does a fantastic job running the school, she&apos;s on top of absolutely everything, she&apos;s kind, thoughtful, prepared, hands-on, and intimately familiar with every child like they are her own.  She&apos;s also constantly updating us and sharing pictures through the Dojo app.  Ms. Cuca has been amazing at showering the girls with love and distraction those tough mornings when they are sad to stay at school.\\n\\nMs. Ana, Ms. Yeni, Ms. Carmen, Ms. Lisandra, and Ms. Maria are spoken about in our home the way we speak about family, we are incredibly grateful to this fantastic team for taking care of the two most important things in our lives all day,  we drop off our girls every morning with peace of mind that they are in the best possible place they can be outside our home.\\n\\nBoth our girls have also thrived in their development, regularly my wife and I notice and are impressed with the new skills they are learning and we give all the credit to this wonderful team.  Our four year old has been able to write her own name for almost a year now, she can identify the first letter of any word she&apos;s given, as well as write any word we spell for her. Our two year old is communicating at least 6 months ahead of her age, and both girls have developed wonderful social skills and manners, showing lots of care for others, sharing, and love being helpful and kind to others.  We also love that Champs doesn&apos;t use screens to distract your children, instead they play music, read, go to the playground, do Yoga, and other activities all day.\\n\\nOne thing you might find off-putting is that they have one (and sometimes two) teacher planning days a month on average, while this may seem inconvenient at first for us working parents because we have to find care for our kids that day, they are actually a blessing.  They use these days really well, our kids are constantly doing really fun, educational activities, they decorate for the different seasons and holidays, and a lot of the activities are holiday-themed.  The teachers all seem very happy as well, one of the biggest issues we had with other daycares is that our daughter kept getting new teachers every 4-6 months because the turnover was ridiculous.  At Champs,  all but one of the teachers has been there for years and years, that speaks volumes about about how they are treated, and I cannot stress enough how important this stability is for children.  There is nothing worse than when your kid bonds with a teacher and they are suddenly gone from their lives because they switched jobs.\\n\\nWe also have become good friends with some of the parents at Champs, we&apos;ll sometimes have dinner together after picking up our kids, or we&apos;ll hang out on the weekends.  Miami is not great at promoting a sense of community like you get in smaller towns, but Champs has provided that for us.\\n\\nI really cannot recommend Champs enough to every parent, our kids are there because friends we trusted recommended it, and in the year+ we&apos;ve been there two other friends have also put their kids there on our recommendation.  It&apos;s one of those places that you know is a loving, welcoming, special place as soon as you walk in.\"},{\"author\":\"Alejandra C.\",\"datePublished\":\"2019-08-12\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"Champs is an amazing preschool!

My twins are very caring and considerate students and are thriving in the environment that BIA creates. The teachers and staff are very caring, loving and truly value educating young minds.

The negative reviews seem bogus just by virtue of their fantastic nature.  Wakefield is nothing like that.\\n\\nMy experience is with multiple children (5) that are currently enrolled in lower and middle school.  Wakefield is a very special place where the only common denominator is an absolute dedication to high quality education by teachers, administrators, parents, AND students.  This is done through very small classroom sizes and an individualized but rigorous academic program.  This is a college prep school for k-12 set on top of a mountain overlooking a hundred miles of rolling countryside.  As beautiful as the campus is it does not compare to the atmosphere of positive reinforcement that is reflected in nearly every interaction on campus.  The place is truly special and our children have each found and fostered their best attributes at Wakefield.\\n\\nWith an indexed tuition program Wakefield attracts a wide spectrum of ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds to its student population.  You will see black, brown, asian, caucasian, and every other ethnicity on campus.  The only commonality is that they come from families that care deeply about the quality of their children&apos;s education and believe in the structure and small classroom sizes at Wakefield.  Each child, and their educational experience, matters.  Each child is taught that one of the most important attributes of successful people is the ability to communicate with others in both written and spoken form.  With small classes and teachers who are free to teach you can&apos;t hide easily in the corner!\\n\\nI recommend to anyone that believes in sacrificing for their children&apos;s education to take a look at Wakefield.

I was lucky that I lived close to PVCC and started taking some classes. I didn&apos;t really have anything in mind, not even a clear goal, I just missed learning.\\n\\nFirst step you have to go through: ADMISSIONS. Be very careful who you talk to here. The advisors have a different take on which classes you can take or not. Advice seems to change from person to person. They are there to sell and make money from the classes they offer. I got credit for most of my courses from my previous degree in a science-related field, but one advisor wanted me to take the math placement test and repeat college algebra. One and a half years later, another advisor, said I didn&apos;t have to take a math placement test and repeat college algebra since my general, organic and biochemistry subjects were credited at the college. I would have wasted time and money on a class I didn&apos;t really have to attend. Thank goodness that sensible advisor was there that day and she signed me up on Statistics I (I got A, btw). In addition, it&apos;s better to talk to Advising in person. Emails won&apos;t get you anywhere.\\n\\nPROFESSORS: I am totally impressed. I took Anatomy and Physiology I and II here, and my professor was an MD. The Statistics I class professor has a doctorate from UVA. The Lifespan Development (PSY230) professor has very good credentials, but I DO NOT recommend HIM. Do NOT taken this professor&apos;s online class (last name starts with R). That psych class was the only B I got. I hate recommending looking up these profs at ratemyprofessor.com, but i totally recommend it now.\\n\\nFACILITY: Cadaver Lab. Great for students who are serious about studying Anatomy. Not all CCs have this kind of lab, so students here are extremely lucky.\\n\\nTESTING CENTER: Smells like the pits. I am very sensitive to smells and I couldn&apos;t concentrate from the moldy smell from the carpet.\\n\\nPROGRAMS: It is a Community College, so only A.D.s are offered. Despite that, the programs are very competitive. During my time here, I&apos;ve seen students compete like it&apos;s the Hunger Games (especially ADN hopefuls) because they only have a few seats in this program. It was what I initially wanted to apply to, and it made me sick to my stomach that I would have to do Battle Royale for this.\\n\\nHAPPY ENDING: As I have mentioned, I thought I was going to apply for an associate degree so I could eventually go back in the workforce after my stint as a sahm, but I got accepted to a 16 month Accelerated BSN program some place else. \\n\\nAVOID: I see a lot of MLM recruiting posted on bulletin boards and weekly job posting emails. It&apos;s even plastered in most cars parked on campus.\\n\\nOverall, it&apos;s a good CC, also affordable. I definitely recommend, especially, for adult learners.\"},{\"author\":\"MrInzombia 2.\",\"datePublished\":\"2016-12-23\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"pvcc will always have a special place in my heart.

The basic gist for a walk in visit is you show up, look around at the examples of what others have done, hopefully get inspired, get a brief lesson in how to cut/break off small pieces of glass and away you go.  \\n\\nThe only real guidelines are that you have to pick a basic pattern/design like a large square which could be used as a bowl or a circle for a plate.  There are different sizes ranging mostly from 5 inches to 12 inches.  Pretty much it&apos;s only needing to pick a size and what colors of glass that are available which are the limiting factors.

Ms. Lorena and Ms. Chenjin are very responsive and patient with all the questions I had at that time. And it turns out that they continue to be very warm, responsive, and helpful after our kids join the school. \\n\\nSecond, the teachers in the toddler program and the four years old program are consistently very nice, caring and professional. Before the Wonder Years, our kids attended another good preschool in our previous neighborhood. My older one was lucky to have nice and responsible teachers through her two years program to four years program in the previous school. However, it wasn&apos;t the case for my younger one since he started the two years program in that school. He cried almost everyday and didn&apos;t want to go to school for the two and half months when he was there. It reversed the potty training progress he had made and reduced his nap time. The situation dramatically changed after he started at The Wonder Years. Ms. Araceli and Ms. Krystal did an excellent job to help him settle in and adjust to the new environment. From day one, there have been very few potty accidents and he started napping a long time again. Every morning he&apos;s very happy that he will be going to school and sometimes he even asks to go to school on weekends. For my older one, she has a lot of friends in her previous school and could get emotional because of the transfer. Ms. Stacey and Ms. Angie from the four years program are very kind, caring and fun, which helped her a lot with the transition. My daughter likes the braid Ms. Stacey makes for her almost every day. She was very happy that Ms. Stacey read her favorite book in the class and commented on how funny the book was. She definitely has a great time in her class. \\n\\nThird, we appreciate that the communication among teachers, the administrative office, and us is very transparent and smooth. Our kids&apos; teachers chat with us about the daily status of the students. Whenever we have any questions or requests, Ms. Lorena and Ms. Chenjin always respond quickly with detailed answers and get our requests addressed.\\n\\nBesides all of the above, we also like the curriculum structure, various activities &amp; events, and the clean and organized classrooms in the school facility.

I am kind of dumbfounded to see that word mentioned in the other reviews, as it was not our experience at all. \\n\\nI would also say the Wonder Years is well-run, organized and professional, but also warm, welcoming and thoughtful on a personal level.\"},{\"author\":\"G P.\",\"datePublished\":\"2021-06-04\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":1},\"description\":\"I deliberated on if I should spend the time to comment and really if I can redirect just one family and save you time and money \u00a0- it is worth it. I removed two children from this preschool after one month. In print and online the school checks all the &quot;right&quot; boxes. What your child experiences daily is quite different IMO. \u00a0I really wanted to like The Wonder Years and after three weeks it was clear, the strict routine and insensitive staff was not the right fit for us.\\n\\nIn the Pre K class the morning expectation is that kids sit in silence and complete worksheets the moment they step into the classroom. I brought this up to the administration (Lorena and Chen) as being too regimented and strict for a 4 year old, their response was that the other option is to sit and read. So I persuaded my child to read one morning, it escalated into a conflict (in front of the class) with Ms. K over if reading is acceptable. I really don&apos;t know how a person in education could discourage reading. During the morning drop-off, I witnessed two teachers shaming children for being disobedient and yelling at other students to stop crying. This was unsettling.\\n\\nMy children gave me every indication they did not enjoy learning, playing or anything todo with The Wonder Years. I ignored my reservations at first but as a concerned parent I could not let it rest. I consulted other parents and child development specialists. The advice that stood out the most to me was that a child in preschool needs to feel emotionally safe and where parents feel a child&apos;s psychological, social and emotional needs are met. I had little confidence left in TWY and I disenrolled my kids immediately. Somewhere in the overrated enrichment classes, language classes, worksheets, copy good (a sticker awarded to my child 3x a week for sitting silently). The nurturing and respect for each child at The Wonder Years is lost along with embracing our kids as individuals.\\n\\nA few more points:\\n- A strict potty time is enforced, expect children to be lined up against the wall like cattle waiting for their turn and for every classmate to finish ahead of them. Accompanied with a lot of yelling to stand, sit and stop talking.\\n- When there is an outbreak and you get an exposure email midday in regards to foot mouth disease, lice, pink eye etc. don&apos;t expect to find out anything more like if this incident started in your child&apos;s classroom. The Wonder Years have their risk mitigation covered as a business.\\n- My observation during enrichment programs is that core teachers sit off to the side scrolling their phones and disinterested.\\n- The classroom lacked variety in activities and seemed to keep toys to a minimum IMO the class setup did not encourage exploration and imagination.\\n- The Mandarin enrichment class was excellent and the teacher connected well with the students, but we wanted to completely separate from TWY.\\n- My experience is pre pandemic and specific to the North Mountain View location on Stierlin. I cannot comment on what has changed since covid or other TWY locations.\\n- Parents were only allowed to tour one school (pre pandemic) and I toured South Mountain View on El Camino. I was told North and South are identical. This is not true. The South has a true gymnasium with equipment and the North location has a multipurpose recreation room that is mainly a classroom with foam mats along one side of the wall.\\n- It was the right decision for my children and family to return to a true play based preschool - where they have thrived, hopefully this post is helpful to you in your search.\"},{\"author\":\"Tiffany W.\",\"datePublished\":\"2018-10-23\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":2},\"description\":\"Our daughter attended TWY for two years (toddler and 2s program) but we ultimately pulled her out of the 3s room.\\n\\nThere&apos;s a slightly long story that&apos;s not really worth going into here, but the basics are:\\n\\nPROS: I think the teachers are good. Ratios are legal, and in the toddlers and 2s room, I felt that the teachers had time to get to know the kids and keep communication open with parents. The hours are pretty work-friendly (although some policies are not). The best part, I think, is that the parents do get to know each other, and the kids hang out outside of school. I loved coming to Jackson park after school to chat with the other families! We made a lot of close friends (who we still keep in touch with!)\\n\\nCONS: We felt that the 3s classroom we were assigned was much more structured and regimented than one would expect of a &quot;play based&quot; preschool, and that our concerns weren&apos;t addressed. (E.g. children being harshly punished for laughing or talking out of turn.) Communication with teachers and especially the administrators was severely lacking. Their response to a couple of reasonable concerns (not being told that our child&apos;s teacher was changed, that the Chinese immersion program we thought we would be enrolled in wasn&apos;t available, that our child had reported a teacher grabbing her in a way that hurt her, etc.) resulted in a strong, very negative reaction that ultimately served as the impetus for us to leave the school.

Their pre-K program (4-5 years old) is nice. But most parents probably do not know if your 2-year old is advanced or not. My daughter went to this school from 2 years old to 4 years old, complained about the school, begged me almost every day to pick her up early.

We really didn&apos;t know where to start and didn&apos;t have much time. We visited a few and talked to other parents to help us understand what was important to us.  Then we simply ranked them by overall fit, cost, and differentiation.  We concluded that for the schools in the area that fit our needs: i) there wasn&apos;t much difference in pricing, ii) there wasn&apos;t any strong differentiation between schools, and iii) most were pretty good overall.  We ended up choosing Wonder Years because they were closer to our home, and we felt that they had a slight advantage over most or all of the points of differentiation that were important to us.  \\nWe were immediately happy with our choice and after after more than 2 years, we are more than happy with our experience and the results.  Our 2-year-old daughter just started this year and we are having the same great experience with her.  \\n\\nIf I had to summarize our experience with Wonder Years in a single sentence it would be this:  They just seem to do everything well across the board that they are able to create a really great environment for child care and development.\\n\\nOtherwise, here is a summary of what we feel the pros and cons are:\\nPros:\\n1) The building is great!  It&apos;s relatively new and was built for its purpose.  We feel it&apos;s a safe building (e.g.: built to more recent safety and earthquake codes, newer materials, etc.), its layout makes it easy for the staff to safely manage the children, and entry is monitored/controlled. They even have toddler-sized flush toilets in the toddler bathroom.   \\n2) The facilities are clean, safe, and well maintained.  The classrooms are modern and well-equipped. I frequently see the teachers cleaning table tops and door knobs. Everything is organized and put away when not in use.\\n3) The teachers and staff are great!  They are experienced, passionate, engaged, are highly interactive with the children and parents, give great feedback to the parents, work with parents to help children work through issues, are very knowledgeable (and consistent) about child development, and clearly like children.  We get a strong sense of coherence and consistency from the teachers and staff; their teamwork really shows through.  We also observe that they are very alert for child safety.  \\n4) The curriculum is great!  They seem to be a mix of play and academic approaches.  But the curriculum covers academic, social, emotional, cognitive, physical, and mental development. They also encourage exploring, experimenting, and being creative.  The approach seems well rounded and well thought-out - both of which are important to us - and we are very pleased with the results.    \\n5) They offer optional enrichment programs to expose kids to languages, music, computers, and dancing.   \\n6) They aren&apos;t perfect and can make mistakes.  But we have observed that they acknowledge mistakes and work to fix them. \\n7) Full year with full or part time options - great for both parents working.   \\n8) The kids (and parents) are great! The kids are well behaved, diverse, are from all over the world, and my son has lots of friends at school. \\n9) Our kids love it!  \\n\\nCons (not much):\\n1)  Several shut downs during the year - a  week in the summer, two weeks at the end of the year.  Difficult when both parents are working.  Some other preschools have similar shut-downs, some don&apos;t. \\n2) Very long waiting list for new prospects - there seems to have been a mini-baby boom in Mountain View these last few years. I know several parents that are frustrated with the situation.  I&apos;ll add that there are several new preschools that have opened up in the area in response to the increase in demand.\"},{\"author\":\"Jigar C.\",\"datePublished\":\"2013-12-17\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"Great program &amp; learning for the kids and the staff is beyond friendly and welcoming.

My son attended the Wonder Years Preschool on Stierlin for 3 months near the end of 2010 when he was almost 3 years old.  I really wanted this school to work.  I loved the location because it was so close to us, and the facility was brand new.  However, I soon came to realize, this was not the right school for my son.\\n\\nOne day, when I picked up my son, his class was in the bathroom getting their diapers changed.  (As mentioned in other reviews, they change diapers every 45 minutes even if a child doesn&apos;t need to be changed.  I&apos;m sure most of his diapers were dry which is extremely wasteful.)  From the hallway outside the bathroom, I heard my son start crying.   BOTH teachers kept saying, &quot;WHY are you crying?  There&apos;s NO crying.&quot;  \\n\\nAs I stood outside the bathroom door, listening to them say this over and over again while he&apos;s sobbing uncontrollably, my neck and face felt hotter and hotter.  I finally went in there, and they stopped suddenly when they saw me.  After I took him outside and he calmed down, he told me that they put on the wrong diaper. He wears Pampers, and they put on a Huggies.  Why they put another child&apos;s Huggies on him, when his cubby only contains Pampers, I will never know.  \\n\\nOne day after I had already given my 30 day notice, my son and I were hanging around outside the front of the school.  I noticed that a couple of kids were knocking on the glass door that leads from the side playground to the front entryway.  The teacher told them to stop knocking on the door.  Apparently, they kept doing it, and suddenly I see Courtney, the director, storm out of her office, throw open the door and yell (literally scream), &quot;STOP HITTING THE DOOR!  I DON&quot;T LIKE THAT!  DON&apos;T DO THAT!&quot;  She then slams the door closed, and walks back into her office.  I remember thinking to myself that everything comes from the top.  If this is the way the director &quot;communicates&quot; with the kids, what prevents the teachers from doing the same?\\n\\nI won&apos;t go into detail about how they did a bait and switch with teachers. Instead of getting the teacher with a couple of years experience that I was told he would get, he got a teacher that didn&apos;t have any teaching experience and was originally hired to be the dance instructor.  I won&apos;t go into detail about how the children spend way too much time standing in line when switching between rooms, about how the teachers never say &quot;hi&quot; and rarely smile, about how I was never told what activities my son did, how much he slept, or what he did outside.

The courses, teachers and staff, are world-class in every measure. In fact, you will, in many cases, find yourself being taught by the very best professors that Stanford has to offer. \\n\\nSeveral of my thirteen course teachers were Stanford faculty that had been awarded Excellence in Teaching awards from their various departments or in a few instances, University-wide awards. You just can&apos;t get any better instruction anywhere and although the prices per unit have risen dramatically, they are still well-worth it for the intellectual and spiritual value you will derive from them. After all, an education is the greatest gift that you can give someone or give yourself and also something that can never, ever be taken away. The C.S. staff is also amazing, from the top on down, everybody is friendly and efficient. If you have questions, they answer them right away. A+ for everyone.\\n\\nSome of the courses I completed were; Music Appreciation, Leadership, Hemingway &amp; Fitzgerald, The Jazz Pianists, Archaeology &amp; the Bible, Gothic Cathedrals, Beginning Spanish, The Jazz Singers, Financial Planning 1 &amp; 2, Financing the High-Tech Startup, Jazz &amp; the Concert Hall and the Invention of American Movies. Taking the Startup Course helped to get my angel-invested company, &quot;Compareitall.com financed so I got the most out of that one until the whole internet bubble crashed, then took us all down.

Yea for Stanford and for me too.\\n\\nPersonally, I love Stanford, all of it with a total love. I love the libraries, the parks, the museums, the churches, the stadiums, the bookstores, the golf course, the cafeterias, the pools and on and on. Often times when the weather is warm, I just drive up from San Jose, park my car and walk around with my business number forwarded to my cell so I can do two things at one time. The campus is gorgeous, with all of the oak trees, walking paths and sandstone buildings to feast your senses upon.

The best classes I took were a medical classes, some rotated through speakers on different topics. They were excellent, super well organized, incredibly useful with the result of making me want to go there should I ever be in dire medical straits. In fact all their medical classes have been excellent, including their mini-med series, and especially anatomy led by a hand surgeon - super awesome.\\n\\nTheir jazz program is amazing, and some of their random offerings, on baseball for instance, were great. Business classes are mixed, depending on the instructor. Actually a lot depends on the instructors. I&apos;ve had non-Stanford professors that were enthusiastic and eager to impart knowledge, Stanford professors that are just as amazing and wise as you&apos;d hope, and once and a while a Stanford professor that so seems to hate teaching that you&apos;re just like, whaaa??? But that&apos;s rare.\\n\\nI took a few writing classes here and for the price wasn&apos;t impressed. The instructors were variably uninterested or unavailable. The student demographic seems markedly different between the online and in person classes. The online classes populations were from all over the world. This meant there were a lot of timezone differences that made for some pretty disjointed classes. The disjointedness was complicated by some students who were needy, or who would complain about the slightest reading load, and many/most who never read others&apos; work. I haven&apos;t yet taken a writing class that hasn&apos;t been populated by people yearning to write their life story, regardless of what the class is supposed to be about. But although I personally might look elsewhere, there seem to be some people that really get a lot out of it - so don&apos;t let me dissuade you.\\n\\nThe organization itself is super responsive. The staff are efficient and nice. Their online registration is easy and excellent. You can drop classes if you do it really quickly and that&apos;s an option if they turn out to be not for you. (They also cancel classes if there&apos;s not enough interest.) Some of the online forum software they use is clunky but other software tools are fine.

I talked with Subi about it and he arranged for them to work with someone else, which we were grateful for. They thoroughly enjoyed their goody bags-students are rewarded well for completing assignments and the boys always were excited to come home with candy, small gift cards etc. Do make sure you read the handbook they give you at orientation. I slipped up and when the kids were in track, they only went 1x a week and were earning make up credits for missed sessions.

I showed up well over an hour before my exam was scheduled and began studying a little bit more. I noticed that there was literally only one person in the front for the better part of the hour I was waiting. It wasn&apos;t until about 20 minutes before testing - 5 minutes before the people taking the exam where supposed to check in - that the rest of the test administration staff started rolling in. \\n\\nThis is a bit of a red flag, as MOST places I have been to try to get there well before check in to make sure the computers we&apos;re testing on are working properly, and if there was an issue they would have time to try and fix it.\\n\\nThis is not at all what happened. \\n\\nThe exam I scheduled myself for was supposed to start at 6:00 pm. I wasn&apos;t told what was going on, aside from &quot;Technical difficulties&quot; until around 6:40 pm at which point the staff mentioned that their wifi in the room was down, and had been for a while and no one had done anything about it.

Only, they gave me the phone number THEY should use to call as it pertained ONLY to the testing center.  \\n\\nMy issue with this site is the gross negligence and incompetence of the testing staff in this unfortunate situation for myself and the other people who where essentially hosed on Thursday night, assured something would be done, and then, shockingly (HEAVY SARCASM) nothing happened.\\n\\nAs of now I am out $400 for this exam, and am expected to handle this myself after their extreme lack of foresight and laziness in this situation.\\n\\nI will not be taking another exam here, nor would I suggest any one else do the same.

It was partially due to the teaching staff and partially due to the fact I have played a crucial role in assisting with the care of loved ones in my life. Clinicals in the lab were shown to us EXACTLY how we needed to do them during our state boards. Literally, exactly. When it was time to take the boards, I felt confident. Apparently much too confident, as I failed and had to reschedule..at no fault of the instructors.. 2nd time around, I passed.

He seemed like a fairly nice guy. One of those &quot;funny&quot; guys that makes jokes through 80% of the lecture. He did have a lot of useful information and was very good at the verbal instruction portion of the class. \\n\\nFor the two riding sessions I had Brian. I did not enjoy Brian&apos;s instruction. Here are a few of the reasons why:\\n\\n#1 After a new exercise Brian said to me, more than once, &quot;did you even understand this? Because you didn&apos;t do it right at all&quot; and that was the entire extent of his feedback. Not, lean to the left or look left or keep your eyes up just &quot;you didn&apos;t do it right at all&quot;. \\n\\n#2 During the exam I asked him for clarification on a turn that we were going to be tested on and he said &quot;this is the turn that we did all day&quot; me &quot;we did a series of turning exercises today, which one is this&quot; Brian &quot;the one you did all day long&quot; me &quot;again we did a variety of turning exercises today could you please tell me the name of the exercise&quot; him &quot;just follow someone else&quot; and he stomped off. \\n\\n#3 I and half the class failed the riding exam. \\n\\nI sent Tim Arnold a follow-up email right away asking him to review my riding assessment. Since he had been such a nice guy in the class I expected him to see that there were only six people in the class (half the normal class size) and see that HALF of those failed and ask Brian what happened. I don&apos;t know about anyone else but if I were given half the customers that my position was expected to be able to handle and HALF of them still failed I would not be patted on the back as an exemplary tester, but instead my instructional skills would be questioned. \\n\\nInstead Tim Arnold (who is the manager as well) refused to even review my riding exam with Brian and told me I could take the class again. I then tried to schedule a second class and it took me no less than 10 emails and THREE weeks to get him to schedule me into a class, during a time that I specifically asked NOT to be enrolled in. Six of my emails he didn&apos;t even respond to. \\n\\nThe next riding lesson was again with Brian. Brian was 80% less douchebag-y that day and actually provided helpful feedback instead of &quot;you didn&apos;t do it right at all&quot;.\\n\\nThe two assistant rider coaches from both sessions were great; Linda and Doug both provided great feedback in a detailed manner and remained upbeat. \\n\\nI spent two weeks riding my motorcycle around town with my learners permit before my next riding lesson and subsequently passed. If you have never driven a manual car or a motorcycle before I would say you have a 99.9% chance of failing. So if you book with these folks be aware that it will likely take you two weekends. \\n\\nThis is not a system where they work more with the people who need it, everyone gets the same amount of time and if you pass you pass, if you don&apos;t see you again for five hours in the sun on asphalt. I would recommend the course offered in the Mission College parking lot over this one. Everyone I know who has taken it mentioned how they worked with those that struggled to ensure they learned the material and passed.

I don&apos;t remember which instructor I had, but I don&apos;t think it was the militant one that previous reviewers had mentioned.\\n\\nThe class is 3 days long- one evening of lecture and two saturdays of riding. I was in a class with only two other girls and then several guys- many of which already rode motorcycles. Apparently, you can get an insurance discount by completing the course, so many were in for that reason. Or had been riding with just a permit for a long time. \\n\\nThe classroom portion is pretty boring, but important to learn. It could probably be condensed into a shorter period of time, but whatever- it&apos;s only one evening.\\n\\nI was super nervous about the riding portion. I didn&apos;t even know how to drive a stick shift car at the time! But the instructors were awesome and patient. I was put on a small Kawasaki bike, which was really comfortable for me. One of the other gals was put on a scooter, rather than a motorcycle, since she only wanted to learn to ride a scooter!\\n\\nThe school will provide a helmet and gloves, but you are responsible for wearing boots that cover your ankles. I did not have any, so I went and bought some inexpensive rainboots and they did the trick. \\n\\nI took my particular session in November and and both weekend riding courses, it poured the entire time!\\n\\nSo, there were probably about a dozen people in the class, which means, a lot of waiting. You spend a lot of time waiting for your turn to do the instructed maneuver. It would have been nice to do more riding and less waiting!\\n\\nWhat was really impressive was how serious these instructors take everything. They will stop you after ever move you do and tell you what you did wrong or right. \\n\\nDuring the second half of the second riding day, it turns into the examination portion. It&apos;s amazing how serious and solemn this part of the class becomes! You&apos;re deducted points for each incorrect move. You&apos;ll have to do basic moves like a figure 8 (can&apos;t put your foot down), shift from 1st to 2nd gear and then stop and start, stop quickly, and much more. It wasn&apos;t easy, that&apos;s for sure. If you drop your bike, it&apos;s an automatic fail. One girl did drop her bike, she was ok, but immediately taken off the course. \\n\\nThankfully, I passed! It was quite interesting to see a handful of those guys that already knew how to ride not pass the course! \\n\\nI highly recommend taking this course if you are considering riding a motorcycle.

One problem with that is they don&apos;t make fresh food all day food is mostly reheat it is very occasional and conditional that you will get fresh food. Another problem with it is that they don&apos;t care about the students they care about getting him in and out they pass their own care if they feel they don&apos;t care it is just you you can have a few connections with a few teachers. Lastly I would like to point out that the environment doesn&apos;t feel very great the students there are the only fun part about it and the teachers there only a few teachers there then OK one positive note though is that those few teachers that are good it will make you your experience a little better there&apos;s one principle that is OK..\"},{\"author\":\"Quin S.\",\"datePublished\":\"2016-03-15\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":4},\"description\":\"Riverdale High School is a great high school. Honestly, as far as Tennessee schools go, the environment is great and the staff genuinely care about the students. Riverdale is nothing like the city schools that are great mis-mash of conflicting cultures and ideals which results in most kids attending private schools. Most students who attend Riverdale have parents who has attended Riverdale which means generations of people love this school.\\n\\nThere are many other little things about Riverdale that make it unique. Although there is definitely a presence of drugs, it&apos;s never become remotely violent. Most people who do drugs here mostly do weed, which isn&apos;t too harmful. Riverdale does have a no-tolerance policy on smoking, drugs, and drinking, so if any student starts to over-do, another student is likely to report them. Most of our problems with stupid Freshmen who think they&apos;re smart. Earlier this year two freshman football players that are not so decent people started vaping every morning before getting on the bus. It got so smelly that they got reported. On another incident, a freshman girl (often tries to be cool by bringing drugs), brought wine in a clear water bottle then shared it. She confessed and got off easy, while the boy she shared it with got suspension because he tried to lie about it being kool-aid. Kids who do serious things get sent to local alternative school.\\n\\nEven with the drugs, Riverdale is very non-violent and very few people actually hate each other. Sure, gossip happens but it&apos;s mostly bark (no bite). Kids here seem to really enjoy talking to each other and the cliques aren&apos;t really that judgmental (excluding the racist hillbilly kids or the black kids, mostly girls, who act uppity). In fact, if you have some smarts, you can make a lot of fast friends in many different colors and interests. It&apos;s a very relaxed environment with very little drama.\\n\\nRiverdale has several focuses. Mr. Nolan, who runs the school, is super lenient with his students. He tries to give them the best and really cares about every kid. \\n\\nIf you&apos;re into machines and fixing uppin, Riverdale has a built in body shop to experiment on cars and other machinery. The ag department also offers a class on fixing farming equipment if you&apos;re into that. As far as electronics go, they also offer programming classes that make videos games and from my impression the students enjoy. During lunch the programming students can be found in the teacher&apos;s room watching videos or working on coding.\\n\\nA good main focus is the student moral and sports. Mr. Nolan loves his rallies in the Gym and recently had the Gym redone as a result. He mainly focuses on rallies for the main sports teams such as football and our famous girls&apos; basketball team that just won again this year. However unless students try to rise up and ask for less popular sports that we&apos;re also mega successful in to me recognized, sports like wrestling will be ignored. They are building another athletics building right now, and I don&apos;t exactly know what it is for. However, they already have a swimming pool, a gym, a track and football field, and among other things. \\n\\nThe ag department has two separate parts. Small animal has an in-building collection of animals, including guinea pigs, rabbits, a corn snake, ferrets, degus, rats, mice, an iguana, two bearded dragons, and chinchillas. They also have rabbits outside in hutches. Large animal charge has sheep, goats, and I believe also works with cows and horses from other places. The ag department hosts FFA which is great for anyone interested in farming, livestock, or just going out and doing stuff with animals. They volunteer with the local shelter.\\n\\nThe science depart is also notable. They have a very active science club that will take outings to the local Barfield-Cresent park and volunteer to pick up trash, test water, etc. They also have taken field trips to go caving or canoeing. Mr. Hurt and Ms. Hargrove are super friendly. Mr. Hurt is arguably my favourite teacher as if you are interested in science and want to learn more about genetics in particular species or have him review scientific papers, he will take extra time to do that.\\n\\nThe language department is eh. They offer Latin, Spanish, and German. The current German teacher is very lenient, sometimes too much. I&apos;m sure he&apos;s a great guy but he sometimes makes fun of his students when they&apos;re trying to learn. I&apos;ve heard eh things about the Spanish teacher as well.\\n\\nThe English department is arguably one of the best. All the English teachers really, really care about their students and their grades. Many of the teachers who get the students with the higher test scores refuse to teach the state tests and instead have us actually writing papers with little worksheets to help us find textual evidence.\\n\\nOverall, Riverdale is a great school with many upsides. It&apos;s an old school and looks run down, but the community makes it worth attending for fourth years. Recommended.\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":2,\"reviewCount\":3}}"]},

The staff/students were friendly, but not professional at all. So much gossiping, joking around, singing and basically I felt like I was just one of those mannequin heads they practice on. Seems like the students should be taught when you make a mistake you don&apos;t announce it for all to hear but instead go find your instructor and quietly tell them what you did wrong. It doesn&apos;t make the customer feel confident about the service they are receiving. The young lady that first introduced herself to me was very sweet but really unsure of herself which is understandable. There were two students working on coloring my hair and neither had a clue as to what they were doing. The instructor left them to their own devices and when she did come back she had to take over because the bleach had been on for quite a while and she had to correct their mistakes. I don&apos;t really blame the students because they didn&apos;t really seem to have a lot of instruction. It took over four hours for them to do my hair and since they were closing they didn&apos;t get to the cut. The color didn&apos;t achieve what was intended but I didn&apos;t really expect it to. But I am pleased with the results. The instructor seems to know her stuff and ended up doing the majority of my color.

This school has been a saving grace for me as an adult learner. \\n\\nI can&apos;t say a single negative thing about my university. From the professors, the curriculum, to the overall student experience has been exceptional. For the education I am receiving, it is worth every penny. It&apos;s not an expensive education considering what I have learned and the village that has been behind me to thrive. \\n\\nIf there was a downside to the university, I&apos;d say parking services sucks and they are determined to collect your money. Watch out when you park and pay attention to ensure you park in the correct lot. If you don&apos;t - it is going to cost you extra money you don&apos;t want to unnecessarily spend. Speaking from recent experience, but I digress. I guess I have officially had my right of passage to receive a parking ticket.\\n\\nMTSU is great for remote learning and easy to understand for those who might not believe that online education is a good fit for them. MTSU caters to those working folks who may not be able to dedicate their entire life to schooling and have other obligations outside of their educational career. I am one of them minus the pandemic. \\n\\nI completed my entire master&apos;s online in 3 semesters due to being a full-time student. It was the best way for my to utilize my time during very a very unpredictable year. I do not regret my decision to get it out of the way. The pandemic shifted a lot in our lives and this was the best track for me to take to thrive. \\n\\nNow, with my doctorate on the horizon, I look forward to working full-time while attending part-time.

I still remember the smell of the biology building--I was grossed out at first but now that smell makes me kind of feel comfortable and warm, haha.\\n\\nAnyone who is considering this University and has visited will know, it&apos;s huge. There are about a million buildings and as one professor said, they&apos;re still &quot;Building the empire.&quot;\\n\\nOne of the things about MTSU that really sets it apart is a program that just recently began called MTeach. If you&apos;re in the market for your degree in teaching, this is the ONLY University in Tennessee that offers this, and I would recommend them very highly. If you want to be a teacher, DO NOT stay at home and go to community college for two years to save money! Start Mteach your freshman year and you will not regret it! It is the most hands on curriculum for teaching teachers. The lady who is presently in charge of it is Sally Millsap, whose contact information can be found on MTSU&apos;s website, and she is an absolute treasure. All of the staff at MTeach are there for you 100% and will give you the individual attention you would not expect from such a large school.\\n\\nThat said, advising here blows. You aren&apos;t going to get good advice from your advisor and you might as well sit down with a course catalog and work out your four year plan by yourself. Maybe have a professor in your department check it, but don&apos;t plan on getting a lot of help. Use your common sense!!!\\n\\nOne of my biggest regrets from my undergrad is not living on campus. MTSU has several dorms that are practically brand new and it&apos;s like a sleepover party every night. My friend lived in one of the dorms and her whole floor was full of girls who became close friends and I wish I&apos;d had that experience.\\n\\nAs far as dining goes, if you don&apos;t have the stomach for normal cafeteria stuff, don&apos;t buy a meal plan unless they force you to. If you do eat on campus, go to JUB. ALWAYS JUB. And try to go around 10:30. They&apos;re going to charge you for breakfast but you can stay until 11 when they start serving lunch. Grab waffles, cereal, and some pizza on the way out. And don&apos;t miss the MTSU chocolate milk. They make it on campus with the farming students and it is the best chocolate milk I have ever experienced.\\n\\nI give MTSU three stars because it&apos;s A-OK. That is exactly how I would describe it. You get what you need for an undergraduate degree. It isn&apos;t as high tech as some of the schools in California (except perhaps for the student health building) but it is the best price in the state for a degree. Live on campus for at least your first two years. Trust me. And then move out into your own place if you&apos;re ready. Murfreesboro is cheap. There are plenty of things wrong with this place, but if I had to go back and do it all over, I wouldn&apos;t change University&apos;s.\"},{\"author\":\"Zachary N.\",\"datePublished\":\"2015-03-15\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":2},\"description\":\"The school itself was fine but the treatment and attitude of the faculty towards a military dependent and brother of two mtsu alum was horrible.

I practically live in the KOM (oldest building on campus) during the semester and it&apos;s falling apart slowly but surely. The AC is either freezing you out of the class or not working at all.

Honestly, when I applied here, I felt like I was settling, but now that I&apos;ve gone through the entire program, I can say that this was the best &apos;touch of Fate&apos; that could have happened to me. \\n\\nI do not like large college institutions with thousands of students enrolled where the classes are large lecture halls where teachers don&apos;t know your name. O&apos;More keeps their enrollment at around 200-300 students and the class room sizes really depend on what kind of class you&apos;re taking (gen. ed. or specific to your major). I&apos;ve had a class with only 3 students (including myself) and I&apos;ve had classes with as many as 25 in them, but the professors know you by name.\\n\\nThe classes have changed every year I&apos;m there, but they get better because of the changes. The staff changes almost every semester, but again, it&apos;s for the better and it&apos;s usually only one or two changes in staff.\\n\\nOne of the things I adore about this school is that the president, Dr. Mark Hilliard, teaches classes! I took a class with him in my junior year (which actually ended up being my favorite and most fun class that semester), I just don&apos;t know of many college presidents that teach classes at their institutions.\\n\\nThere are a few clubs at the school (SGA, a Green club, a Film Club, and my personal favorite: the O&apos;More Supper Club), and we do have several social events every year, but participation can be spotty. Students coming here aren&apos;t necessarily looking for a social scene until they hit their junior year (when the realize they do want to be in the social scene), but when we do have a party, we like to get down.\\n\\nAnd if you&apos;re worried about it being a vocational school as opposed to a liberal arts school, I want to let you know that O&apos;More offers a very well-rounded curriculum (at least in the Fashion department). I&apos;ve taken lots of sewing and illustration classes, but I&apos;ve also taken writing courses, life/family courses, psychology courses, and several business courses, as well as multiple art and art history courses.\\n\\nPossibly one of my favorite things about this school is the opportunity for world-travel during the summer; after you complete 60 hours, you have the opportunity to take a trip to several different locations that the school plans out. And the cool thing is that it might not be as expensive as you&apos;d think because you pay a &apos;globalization fee&apos; every year that goes towards these trips. This past summer, I participated in the trip to Italy and it was a life-changing experience! I had so much fun and saw so many amazing places.\\n\\nAlso, the fact that the campus (which is insanely beautiful and cozy) is practically a stone&apos;s throw away from downtown Franklin is a definite plus. There are no dorms, but they do have you fill out roommate forms and connect you with students you&apos;d be compatible with, as well as give you a ton of information about surrounding apartments; however, they have acquired the &apos;Bell Historic Franklin&apos; property for student housing for next semester.\\n\\nI could rave on and on about this school, but you&apos;re probably tired of reading this, hah.

In addition to the services, I was asked to participate in a bake sale, buy tickets for a fashion/hair show at $10 a pop, and to buy tickets for a Lyme disease fundraiser for coupons for discount services.

I hope it won&apos;t be his last.\\n\\nWhen my friend told me we were going to a shooting range while in Nashville for her bachelorette party, I, of course, thought it was the most brilliant thing I had ever heard.  Up until then, I had never fired a gun before.  In fact I had never even imagined myself shooting a gun but once the plans were set, it became my mission to find the perfect shooting outfit to complete my first timer experience (eventually landing on cowboy boots, an american flag/eagle tshirt and jean vest, topping it all off with bright red lipstick of course).\\n\\nWe arrived shortly before 10AM for a scheduled four hour session with Jeff.   He was pretty laid back in his approach which was perfect for a group of 11 girls who were already moving slow on a ridiculously hot day post booze ingestion the day/night before.  That&apos;s not to say Jeff was so relaxed that he didn&apos;t go over all the major safety concerns, and how to handle a gun properly to avoid any accidents.  He routinely reminded us to keep the gun pointed away from us, and other people and never have our fingers on the trigger until we&apos;re ready to fire.  Even with the gun not loaded, I was pretty sure I was going to shoot myself in the foot.  Jeff&apos;s son was also there to assist us and keep things moving along in what turned about to be one of the most fun bachelorette events I&apos;ve attended.  \\n\\nWe started by getting acquainted with some handguns and revolvers, shooting at predators of the paper male variety.  I have to admit that although Jeff warned us of the kickback, I was completely terrified and ill-prepared for the kickback of my gun when I first fired it.  I was a bit deterred at first and wasn&apos;t sure I was even going to continue, but with a little persuasion from Jeff, all of us got over our initial shock and before we knew it we were shooting at balloons, rarely missing a shot feeling like total bad asses.  \\n\\nWe had the opportunity to fire shot guns, rifles, and hand guns, and we actually ended up leaving a bit earlier than scheduled due mostly to the heat.  I think a three hour session is probably all anyone would need to have a great time shooting the variety of guns Jeff has to offer.\\n\\nI would highly suggest to any gal planning a bach&apos; in Nashvegas to add this to the agenda.  It&apos;s a great way to get in touch with the country inside us all.\\n\\nBig thanks to Jeff and his son!

As a gun-totin&apos; state, Tennessee obviously has an incentive to keep its citizens educated about the weapons they proudly lug around. As such the state has a series of public shooting ranges where they teach new gun owners and allow firing to take place under a watchful eye.  \\n\\nComing from very anti-gun states, this was one of the first things some of my buddies decided that we should try out.  For $5.50, you get 2 hours to in outdoor ranges to fire at targets up to 100 yards for rifles or 50-foot ranges for handguns.  This is probably the best place to fire a gun if you own one in Nashville: it is close, cheap, and kept under iron discipline.  A series of safety experts check and check repeatedly to make sure you don&apos;t screw up and hurt yourselves.  The guns are thoroughly inspected before firing, the ranges are strictly divided between &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cold&quot; times, and malfunctions and mistakes are instantly tackled upon; many in the range seem quite annoyed at the &quot;range nazis&quot; but I appreciated how they kept a tight ship. \\n\\nAs the closest range to Nashville, this also has the widest assortment of people and guns, ranging from students to those people of the hills.  I have encountered no issues here, and the people are generally quite friendly and may allow you to try out their weapons. \\n\\nAs much as I dislike guns, I admit it raises something primeval in me when I fire those things.  For those suburban Rambos out there, this is a pretty good spot, especially for those new at guns or simply interested in trying it out.

The stone steps and stairs in the dormitory had deep troughs worn in them from a hundred years of wear. The students, as I remember, were rich New England types and kind of assholish.

This has been a long awaited review. I have been at MTSU since 2018. I completed my last year of my bachelor&apos;s, my master&apos;s, and in August - I start my doctorate. This school has been a saving grace for me as an adult learner. \\n\\nI can&apos;t say a single negative thing about my university. From the professors, the curriculum, to the overall student experience has been exceptional. For the education I am receiving, it is worth every penny. It&apos;s not an expensive education considering what I have learned and the village that has been behind me to thrive. \\n\\nIf there was a downside to the university, I&apos;d say parking services sucks and they are determined to collect your money. Watch out when you park and pay attention to ensure you park in the correct lot. If you don&apos;t - it is going to cost you extra money you don&apos;t want to unnecessarily spend. Speaking from recent experience, but I digress. I guess I have officially had my right of passage to receive a parking ticket.\\n\\nMTSU is great for remote learning and easy to understand for those who might not believe that online education is a good fit for them. MTSU caters to those working folks who may not be able to dedicate their entire life to schooling and have other obligations outside of their educational career. I am one of them minus the pandemic. \\n\\nI completed my entire master&apos;s online in 3 semesters due to being a full-time student. It was the best way for my to utilize my time during very a very unpredictable year. I do not regret my decision to get it out of the way. The pandemic shifted a lot in our lives and this was the best track for me to take to thrive. \\n\\nNow, with my doctorate on the horizon, I look forward to working full-time while attending part-time.

I believe some of them may have developed or are beginning to develop symptoms related to asbestos exposure now, such as mesothelioma or lung cancer. My mother died from cancer in 1995 and I remember my father saying that he believed she might have been exposed to the asbestos that was in the building my family lived in in the early 1990s (Smith Hall).\\n\\nMy father was a whistleblower who blew the whistle on MTSU for exposing students to asbestos.

It&apos;s a fun place to be a freshman, and have your first college experience. I got my undergraduate degree here in Biology. I still remember the smell of the biology building--I was grossed out at first but now that smell makes me kind of feel comfortable and warm, haha.\\n\\nAnyone who is considering this University and has visited will know, it&apos;s huge. There are about a million buildings and as one professor said, they&apos;re still &quot;Building the empire.&quot;\\n\\nOne of the things about MTSU that really sets it apart is a program that just recently began called MTeach. If you&apos;re in the market for your degree in teaching, this is the ONLY University in Tennessee that offers this, and I would recommend them very highly. If you want to be a teacher, DO NOT stay at home and go to community college for two years to save money! Start Mteach your freshman year and you will not regret it! It is the most hands on curriculum for teaching teachers. The lady who is presently in charge of it is Sally Millsap, whose contact information can be found on MTSU&apos;s website, and she is an absolute treasure. All of the staff at MTeach are there for you 100% and will give you the individual attention you would not expect from such a large school.\\n\\nThat said, advising here blows. You aren&apos;t going to get good advice from your advisor and you might as well sit down with a course catalog and work out your four year plan by yourself. Maybe have a professor in your department check it, but don&apos;t plan on getting a lot of help. Use your common sense!!!\\n\\nOne of my biggest regrets from my undergrad is not living on campus. MTSU has several dorms that are practically brand new and it&apos;s like a sleepover party every night. My friend lived in one of the dorms and her whole floor was full of girls who became close friends and I wish I&apos;d had that experience.\\n\\nAs far as dining goes, if you don&apos;t have the stomach for normal cafeteria stuff, don&apos;t buy a meal plan unless they force you to. If you do eat on campus, go to JUB. ALWAYS JUB. And try to go around 10:30. They&apos;re going to charge you for breakfast but you can stay until 11 when they start serving lunch. Grab waffles, cereal, and some pizza on the way out. And don&apos;t miss the MTSU chocolate milk. They make it on campus with the farming students and it is the best chocolate milk I have ever experienced.\\n\\nI give MTSU three stars because it&apos;s A-OK. That is exactly how I would describe it. You get what you need for an undergraduate degree. It isn&apos;t as high tech as some of the schools in California (except perhaps for the student health building) but it is the best price in the state for a degree. Live on campus for at least your first two years. Trust me. And then move out into your own place if you&apos;re ready. Murfreesboro is cheap. There are plenty of things wrong with this place, but if I had to go back and do it all over, I wouldn&apos;t change University&apos;s.\"},{\"author\":\"Zachary N.\",\"datePublished\":\"2015-03-15\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":2},\"description\":\"The school itself was fine but the treatment and attitude of the faculty towards a military dependent and brother of two mtsu alum was horrible.

Wish we would have made the move sooner. After touring the school by myself, I left knowing this was going to be a great fit for our child. Their two day visit was their favorite of all of the schools they checked out because &apos;They actually teach you things and the kids want to learn.&apos; The campus is beautiful, but beyond that, a few things stood out.\\n1. The head of middle school was great. She was engaging and immediately handed me two business cards. She asked me to please pass one on to my child and let them know that they could contact her with any questions they may have.  My child felt like the head of middle school genuinely cared about them and proceeded to send an email asking a few questions/concerns they had. This was huge for my child.\\n2. All of the students played together.  We watched a huge divide occur in 2nd grade at our previous school. Boys played football and soccer, and girls stood around. At St. Michael&apos;s the main playground equipment is built to accommodate all ages. Kids all played together and had fun. There was no division between boys and girls. I really liked how the middle schoolers came together so much. \\n3. The depth of learning going on, the number of options for a smaller school, and the responsibility placed, taught and expected from the middle school students was something that I knew my child would appreciate and could learn from. My child loves learning and wants to be challenged. I knew they would be challenged on many different levels.\\n\\nThings that we have loved since attending: \\n* I love the Harry Potter&apos;esque&apos; houses that each student gets placed in at the beginning of their school year. This is a good way to bring together the 3 year olds up to 8th graders to cheer on their houses at different events. \\n* I love the fact that field trips still happen through 8th grade. \\n* I love the after school sports programs and how students are introduced to different sports even if they aren&apos;t overly sporty. \\n* I love the fact that my child can stay after school for extra homework help and I can pick them up at the end of my work day. \\n* I love how the school is a STEAM based school with amazing opportunities to explore including using the maker space to create solutions to problems and as a creative outlet to design things.\\n* I love how there is lots of project based learning allowing students to have a deeper understanding of what they are learning about. The choices of how they will present and share their learning have been equally impressive and have forced my child to try new skills like sewing, stop motion and green screen technology. \\n* I love the diversity of students that comes from the numerous military families attending from all over the globe. My child has learned about different cultures and languages because of this. \\n* I love how the Choose Love program isn&apos;t just a bunch of sayings slapped on a wall as it sometimes is in other schools. The curriculum is used along with mindfulness, meditation, and self reflection and the students really practice what they learn. \\n* I love how mistakes are encouraged as part of the process of learning and improving. \\n* I love how the school has great community activities such as back to school picnics, ice skating days, parent get togethers, and opportunities to help support the community at large through volunteer projects. The parent&apos;s association is active and inclusive.\\n* I love that foreign language is 4 hours a week starting in 5th grade with exposure in elementary school. \\n* I love the science lab, PE and Heath classes and the focus on arts. So many schools are cutting arts and music programs. At St. Michael&apos;s you are exposed to chorus, band, studio arts, stage craft, cos-play and actor&apos;s studio. \\n* I love how the teachers are engaging and so wonderful in their enthusiasm. They have a great pulse on their students and are really working hard to make students become better students and better contributors to society.\\n* I love the administrative team and how they communicate with families and really get to know the students.\\n* I love how encouraging the student body as a whole is.

We enrolled him in the school this past fall, and he was having several accidents.  Although at first the staff did work with us and involved a school therapist, they grew tired and told us not to bring him back until he was accident-free for 7 days.

Have always loved Vandy and thought highly of it. The campus is very pretty and staff were friendly. It was nice to walk campus with a guide taking a peek into residence hall, dining hall, etc. Unfortunately Vandy has fallen prey to the woke culture. They spent a LOT of time really focusing on their 1st slide of the presentation, strongly emphasizing how committed they are to equity, LGBTQ, BLM, etc. It wasn&apos;t that they value diversity and inclusion. It was a huge helping of identity politics that continued beyond slide 1, being reinforced multiple times through the presentation as well as along the tour. The LGBTQ flag was in the window leading up to the meeting, hanging in the residence hall, &amp; regularly displayed around campus. Doesn&apos;t matter to me what someone&apos;s sexual preference may be, but I want to pick a university based on their educational quality and that seemed to take a back seat in the discussions.  On a side note, the flags were the old version rather than the newer one so makes me wonder if this isn&apos;t all just an effort at virtue signaling.

The staff/students were friendly, but not professional at all. So much gossiping, joking around, singing and basically I felt like I was just one of those mannequin heads they practice on. Seems like the students should be taught when you make a mistake you don&apos;t announce it for all to hear but instead go find your instructor and quietly tell them what you did wrong. It doesn&apos;t make the customer feel confident about the service they are receiving. The young lady that first introduced herself to me was very sweet but really unsure of herself which is understandable. There were two students working on coloring my hair and neither had a clue as to what they were doing. The instructor left them to their own devices and when she did come back she had to take over because the bleach had been on for quite a while and she had to correct their mistakes. I don&apos;t really blame the students because they didn&apos;t really seem to have a lot of instruction. It took over four hours for them to do my hair and since they were closing they didn&apos;t get to the cut. The color didn&apos;t achieve what was intended but I didn&apos;t really expect it to. But I am pleased with the results. The instructor seems to know her stuff and ended up doing the majority of my color.

Only in Paris for a few days, my friends and I knew a wine and cheese tasting was on our to-do list. The workers at Paroles de Fromagers set us up with an affordable reservation they happen to have available the day of, and upon arrival, they gave us a tour around the shop (it&apos;s small, but there&apos;s lots to look at!), pointing out different cheeses and how they&apos;re made. The storage room has enormous wheels of cheese bigger than I could carry if I tried, and while he explained the cheese-making process, our host also described what cheeses and wine pairings he preferred as well as different breathing techniques to properly taste each cheese and its unique bacterial flavorings. At the end of the tour and explanation, we were led downstairs into a private cellar to enjoy our personal wine and cheese boards, complete with the proper pairings. Each cheese was an experience of its own to taste, and each sample was unique in its flavoring and texture, as were the characteristics of the wine. Always a Manchego girl, the firmest cheese was my favorite, but I branched out and found I loved the bleu and soft sheep cheeses as well!\"},{\"author\":\"jesse s.\",\"datePublished\":\"2019-05-10\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"If you get a chance, definitely take the cheese and wine tasting class.

She had spoken to them on the phone for over an hour and they had her very excited for the program.  They told her they had scholarships that would cover most, of not all, of her tuition.  They also told her they would help with housing, as they do not have student housing on campus.  \\n\\nFirst, the campus is obviously well-funded.  Great.  Lots of bells and whistles and facades.  They greeted us, and a very large group of other kids/parents, and herded us into a large studio where a host and videos were hyping up the school and the projects their alumni have worked on.\\n\\nThen they broke the group down into smaller groups based on what their &quot;degree&quot; interest was.  They took them into classrooms with laptops and gave them a sample lesson on game design and game programming.  Thank goodness they had student helpers as most of the kids were lost as it went so fast.\\n\\nDuring this time I did some research online about the school and unfortunately wished I had done it prior to making the drive from Jax.  From what I read and what we witnessed, most, if not all, of the &quot;teachers&quot; are former students.  They don&apos;t have teaching degrees and some do not have real-life experience in what they are teaching other than going to classes.\\n\\nThe admissions director gave a talk and then brought out former alumni for a roundtable session.  There was not a Q&amp;A session, which I found somewhat odd.\\n\\nWe were fed a catered lunch and then sent back to another area for specific information.  They had info on housing, admissions, financial aid, and general questions.\\n\\nI asked in admissions what their graduation rate was and was told, &quot;well, if you look it up online it will show 30%, but it&apos;s really closer to 60-70%&quot;.  The rationale behind this is that it is a 20-month program, and very few finish in that time, therefore skewing their results. Uh, no, it is what it is.\\n\\nMy daughter asked about housing assistance, and they told her she could take out a loan for rent.  My daughter said, &quot;I&apos;m not been adulting very long but even I knew this was not a smart idea.&quot;\\n\\nAnd don&apos;t even ask about credits transferring as you will get the most convoluted answer, if any at all.  They do not offer any classes where the credits will actually be accepted by an accredited university.  This is a big red flag to me.\\n\\nAnd now tuition - you won&apos;t get a straight answer about that either, but I finally did get someone to say that it&apos;s around $91,000 for the program my daughter was interested in.  $91K?  For 20 months.  And they expect you to go to class 40 hours a week, and then most work an additional 10-20 hours per week on projects.  So, you&apos;re never going to be able to work during school, like so many have to to pay for expenses.\\n\\nAll in all, it sounds great and looks great, but just not the school for us.  First, the cost.  Second, you can&apos;t transfer any credits, so if you end up hating what you&apos;ve started, you have to start over at zero.  Third, it just felt more like a timeshare presentation, and no one really wanted to give straight answers to the more pertinent questions.  Do your research.  Maybe it works out well for some.  Obviously they&apos;re doing something right as they&apos;ve been in business for 40 years, but it is a for-profit college, and that alone tells you a lot.\"},{\"author\":\"Kae ..\",\"datePublished\":\"2022-10-18\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":1},\"description\":\"***RED FLAGS***\\nWas planning to enroll in August and told them that I wanted to pay in full ($10k) upfront for the animation certificate program.\\nThey ignored me multiple times and insisted on telling me to apply for financial aid because I might have free grant money.\\nI applied and there were no grants available just financial aid (loans) that I refused because AGAIN I did not want any debt/loans. \\n\\nI offered to pay upfront ($10k) for the certificate.

I would definitely reconsider getting a degree in the Audio Production program. I had success on my own as producer, I came to Full Sail to explore audio engineering. They tried their best to help with getting students acclimated to the music industry but they are not keeping up with technology. They don&apos;t even teach anything on creating NFT&apos;s (although new) this can create independence. I introduced the business teacher to audio NFT&apos;s, I was an online student. I had previous background in I.T, so I already came with my AS degree. But that is when I noticed the first red flag, they tried to give me a hard time with my prior transcript. Insinuating  that I will have to pay out of pocket. I had a 4.0 GPA, once I declined, they called me back and magically the out of pocket fee disappeared! \\n\\nDon&apos;t be fooled by their advertisements and sale pitches... make sure you do your due diligence if you decide to embark on this journey.

But that will soon change once all the students start to attend, like the music programs. They do a good job in selling dreams but their graduation rate in my program was around 50-60%. This is something to factor into your decision. The tuition will be high regardless, they justify that by being For-Profit. They take a lot from you and give back the bare minimum. Do the math, even after the pandemic and adding a student advocacy program to help the students it doesn&apos;t suffice. You have to wait four months to get your launch box, and watch them give lectures on old software. The equipment they give doesn&apos;t even add up to 30% of your tuition.... So your paying for the name of school, and the experience with the teachers. If you get the right ones, you may get people who have 20-30 years experience, or you may get a teacher who has very little. These extremes are difficult for any student to cope with, especially if you have a family or a personal life.

After each test session, it can either last for an hour, 2 hours or even 4 hours sometimes. You complete a survey and you&apos;re done.\\n\\nYou can get compensated PSN/XBL gift cards or even Publix gift cards. Though I never got compensated for any of that.

And yes, it&apos;s mandatory. There is even a mandatory Christmas party, and if you don&apos;t go you&apos;ll fail your month of class. Nothing is learned in this. Friday blend is also where MCBS likes to appreciate the students who are about to graduate, and they start crying and taking pictures of the graduates, but only if they like you. If you&apos;re a favorite. If you&apos;re not, expect zero emotion or care. It&apos;s a huge waste of four hours of class time that is required for attendance. \\n\\nDuring my two years at full sail, I learned nothing at all, except don&apos;t try to be nice to people who won&apos;t ever care about you. I tried to be nice to the faculty in MCBS and on graduation day, I walked by them after the ceremony, and none of them even congratulated me. It wouldn&apos;t have been too hard to congratulate me considering there were only 8 graduates. \\n\\nOverall I could have dealt with the lack of community and the money grabs, after all what college doesn&apos;t want your money? However the MCBS program was just horrifying and I can&apos;t even believe things like that are allowed to happen. Maybe it&apos;s different in other degrees, who knows.\\n\\nAwful, awful place. Oh and not to mention since I finally escaped this place, they won&apos;t stop emailing me and calling me to see if I even graduated! Shows how much they actually recognize the students worth.\"},{\"author\":\"Mi G.\",\"datePublished\":\"2020-01-18\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":4},\"description\":\"A good place to be working with, people have positive behavior  and kind heart always help you when you need, with different workstations between classes to focus on  your craft and master your skills\"},{\"author\":\"Amit L.\",\"datePublished\":\"2019-06-10\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":1},\"description\":\"All the reviews that you read ablut this being a money hungry place is true.

There is no other school providing such a high-end facility to students. However, you get very limited access to these facilities (in my experience, it was less than 2 months of the entire 24month program that I even accessed the studios). \\n\\nAlso - this is not a regionally accredited school. So if you have any plans to further your education anywhere other than Full Sail once you&apos;re finished, your credits will not transfer. So in my case I would like to get a Master&apos;s Degree, however my only option would be to get it from Full Sail. Otherwise I would need to make up a LOT of credits before I would even be eligible for a Master&apos;s program at another school. \\n\\nLast, the school is VERY expensive. If your parents are willing to pay for it, that is one thing. I did not have that luxury and took out student loans (nearly $100k) to pay for my school and living expenses for 2 years. These were privatized loans, some with interest as high as 13%. At 18 years old I was too young, naive, and excited to realize what that meant as far as payments after graduation, and I soon found myself with an expected $1,000/month student loan bill. As a new graduate looking for my first job, this was very steep, and I soon found myself resorting to deferment and other options to delay these payments (only further compounding the total cost). \\n\\nWhile there are some degree programs from Full Sail with lots of job potential, there are many with very limited jobs. For example, Full Sail has been pumping out 200+ students each month from their audio program for the past 15+ years. There are not nearly that many studio or audio industry jobs. As you will find, most Full Sail graduates have resorted to finding work in alternate industries (myself included). \\n\\nThat all said, I learned a lot at Full Sail, and aside from mainly the cost, it was a positive experience. For those that take the classes seriously (only about 50%) there is much to learn and gain from your time there. However, overall it was very  unprofessional (felt more like a highschool than a college), and you don&apos;t earn a real accredited degree for the time and money that you spend. \\n\\nI would very strongly consider other options before recommending Full Sail to anyone else.\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":2.5,\"reviewCount\":128}}"]},

The right people you would want taking care of your child when you are not around. Also, and this may not mean much for some...but this facility is the most diverse facility I visited when shopping for childcare.

BAD IDEA.  I would not leave my wife with him during an inspection again.  \\n\\nI  wouldn&apos;t mind him training his students but he didn&apos;t even go over major items found during the inspection.  At the inspection he said only little minor items found so we waived our inspection contingency based on what HE said but now is blaming us.\\n\\nNot until I looked in detail at the report did I discover major items that should have been brought up as red flags. For example, one of his documents noted &quot;acceptable water pressure&quot; to be between 40 to 90 psi. The reading he took a pic of for our house was barely 30psi. Also noted was water flow was very low and &quot;indications of a DEFECT in the water supply&quot;. Had I not analyzed the report, we would have never known. \\n\\nWe were left scrambling to figure out what to do since we waived our inspection and had no recourse with the seller for the defects before buying the house! We wasted our time and our realtor&apos;s time to get resolved.  \\n\\nWhen confronted, Robbie only gave us excuses and now is blaming us for the poor inspection. We waived our inspection contingency because of what HE told us, let&apos;s get that clear.  \\n\\nContrary to what Robbie says, my concern for low water pressure and water flow is NOT a personal preference or an opinion. It was way below the standard MINIMUM ACCEPTABLE industry range (even says that in his own documents). When confronted, he even said that was way too low for his home and had to fix. Now he says it&apos;s beyond his legal requirement as a home inspector to tell me.  \\n\\n&quot;indications of a defect in the water system&quot;  his company&apos;s words in the inspection report. \\n\\nWhy would you not mention during or after the inspection and leave it to homeowner to find out.

Worse, Top Notch has not taken responsibility for the damage they caused.  \\nIn testing the reverse function of the opener, the Top Notch Inspector lowered the door and, while the door was coming down, &quot;tested&quot; the reverse function by attempting to stop the door when it reached his waist level (the inspector is a large, strong man) from descending further by using what appeared to be all of his arm, shoulder and body strength.  He applied considerable force to stop the movement of the metal panel door.  I directly observed he even attempted to reverse the downward momentum of the door&apos;s direction by pulling/pushing up on the door, against its downward motion.  The door temporarily halted, grinded and then, after &quot;maximum&quot; force was applied and then released, grinded downward.\\n\\nThe very next time I opened the door, it rose approximately one third of the way, then it shook, ground, vibrated violently, twisting in the roller frame, the garage door window shattered, spewing glass all over the garage and stopped.  The top frame, where the opener operator arm attaches to door, had buckled, causing the warping/torquing of door in the frame, and causing the window glass to break.   Previous to Top Notch&apos;s &quot;test,&quot; the door operated flawlessly.\\n  \\nGarage Door Opener Manufacturer guidance for testing the reverse function is explicit and clear:  you place a 2x4&quot; board flat on the ground and allow the door to descend, strike the board and reverse.  You do not &quot;yard&quot; on the door as it is descending.  Manufacturers adamantly warn against this maneuver, saying it is both dangerous and will often result in over-torquing metal panel doors, resulting in extensive damage.\\n  \\nI spent considerable time cleaning up the mess from the breakage, making temporary repairs to the garage door, replacing the glass, obtaining estimates and filing extensive paperwork with Top Notch&apos;s Insurance Company, where my claim has now idled five weeks with no action taken.  This insurance diversion tactic is a way some unscrupulous companies use to get the claim out of mind and out of sight, where the insurance company will ultimately find a way to deny it.  Meanwhile, the homeowner has to absorb the costs of thousands of dollars of damage to his/her property caused by, in this case, inspector negligence.\\n   \\nI deeply regret allowing Top Notch into my home and will never do so again.  Addressing the damage thus far has cost me weeks of my life, with more to come.  It&apos;s ironic that Top Notch is also a Home Inspection School, teaching new inspectors the &quot;correct&quot; way to inspect homes.  Mistakes are sometimes made, but reputable companies will assume responsibility for them and indemnify those affected.  Not this company.   It has been nothing but a protracted stonewalling and avoidance maneuver with refusal to correct a glaring error.  Realtors that commission home inspections may also share in liability for inspector negligence that leads to substantial, unresolved damage.\"},{\"author\":\"Christina E.\",\"datePublished\":\"2020-09-27\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"Robbie and his assistant were wonderful to work with.

We actually stumbled across the school on yelp because we were in search for structured Socialization.  After learning more about what Spanish immersion was and touring the school, we were sold on sending our 2 year old there to get a jumpstart on learning another language, especially because we are in English only speaking household. Our son began attending Miro at 15 months and has been there for less thank one year. He has learned so much Spanish! I&apos;ve noticed him saying things to me in Spanish that bring me back to when I was in high school and learned a little bit of the language. For example, he opens the fridge and says &quot;papas!&quot; (Potatoes) and points to so many things and will say &quot;aqui!&quot; (Here). He can easily count to 10 in spanish, knows all his facial features in Spanish, and can sing many rhymes and songs in Spanish not to mention easily over 100 words (well probably more, but i need to brush up on my Spanish!!).  The teachers are wonderful. His teacher last year, maestro Betty is phenomenal.  She loves every student as one of her own kids and really cares about their well being and education.  Because my son was so young when he started, and began going to school full time from the start (7:30-3 Monday-Friday) it was a little bit of an adjustment. Betty did not even bat an eye when my son would cry for the first little while every morning i would drop him off. Now he doesn&apos;t want to leave school when we go to pick him up! The school is like a family and i would recommend this school to anyone looking for something more than &quot;daycare&quot;. If you&apos;re looking for a diaper changing babysitter, MIRO IS NOT for you. But if you are wanting the absolute best care, curriculum, structure, education, clean facility, MIRO IS THE PLACE! Go for a tour and meet Fabiana, the owner. I promise you won&apos;t regret it. And just because it&apos;s a Spanish immersion, doesnt mean it will empty your wallet. You get so much by sending your child to this school, at an extremely reasonable price. You need to go check it out.

I have found that many use it as a tool to retaliate against a business, especially without first contacting the business directly and giving them an opportunity to address the concerns. That being said, I did contact the business first, but failed to find any common ground with the owner. Here is my story: \\n\\nI was researching Driving Schools for my 15 1/2 year old. There are many and when I came across Driving MBA I did check their reviews. They were mixed, and the negative reviews often received long rants from the business owner explaining her position (I expect one here as well). Despite the mixed reviews, I contacted them anyway. I was pleased with their detailed and intensive program, and the proximity (convenience) to where I live. I ultimately signed up for their most expensive package. It was $1570.00 and included 10 hours of on-road instruction, plus a variety of simulator and classroom hours. Upon signing up we signed a contract and in multiple locations, agreed to their &quot;No Late Cancellations, No Exceptions&quot; policy. I didn&apos;t take exception with this policy which stated, you must cancel/reschedule a class more than 24 hours in advance or be subjected to a fee. This seemed reasonable to me. I never considered what might happen in my child woke up sick one morning that she had a class...\\n\\nThis past Monday, my daughter had a 3:30pm appointment scheduled. She woke up that morning with a fever. We took her to the doctor immediately. We also called the school immediately and informed them. Here is what we were told: We can pay a $75.00 fee for cancelling, forfeit the course (and lose the money we paid for that class) or send her in to the class. None of these options seemed reasonable to me. We were told to contact the owner (Maria) which I tried to do. I simply asked her to call me. Instead, I received a very long email stating again her policy, fairness, her business costs, and telling me she would do nothing about it. We went back and forth and it became clear that Maria has dealt with this issue before. She will not budge. However, my true issue is that she lacks any type of &quot;sick child&quot; policy. All schools have policies about sick children. Most say that your child needs to be fever free (without medication) for 24 hours prior to returning to school. That is not the case at Driving MBA. In fact, they offer a disincentive to keep your sick child home. They tell you that you will be charged a fee or lose the class if your child does not come in.\\n\\nI am not the type of parent that sends my child to school sick, especially to risk others (like students and teachers) being contaminated. Maria&apos;s response to this was that they wipe down the equipment. I know that some parents, when faced with these choices, will give their child Tylenol and send them in. Flu, chicken pox, strep, doesn&apos;t matter. I do not begrudge those parents who do, I just don&apos;t agree with that type of policy. I had hoped that Maria would have some business common sense and realize this is a flawed policy. Apparently not. I told Maria that I would not send my child back and requested a refund for my unused hours (well over $800 worth). Again, I was told, read the contract. I get to keep your money, even though I did not earn it or provide the services. Again, she&apos;s right and I did agree to that. Maria will likely respond to this post with a long-winded rant about her contract, her policies, paying employees, she&apos;s a small business, being fair to all, etc... All of this is true. However, my post is to share my personal story and let you know to be careful before you sign up. \\nThere&apos;s no mention in any contract about your child waking up sick or any sick policy at all. I believe she has a reason for not addressing this in her contract. So, I&apos;m out my money and had to find a new school. We signed up with Stop and Go Driving school https://www.stopandgo1.com/ and so far they have been fantastic! It&apos;s disappointing that I lost my money and had to pay for another school, but better than sending my child to a school that obviously allows sick kids to attend (if their parents are willing). \\n\\nNow for Maria&apos;s response in three....two....one......\"},{\"author\":\"Ali Z.\",\"datePublished\":\"2020-09-21\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":4},\"description\":\"Overall, we were happy with our experience at Driving MBA.

It was a disappointment for sure, but the instructors were right. We practiced for another month on our own, then the girls passed their tests w/ MBA. After the tests, MBA uploaded the info onto the ADOT system, and it was easy to go there immediately after to obtain their licenses. Communication could be a bit better.

Handing car keys over to your teen before they are really ready for the responsibility to get behind the wheel could have very dire consequences.\\n\\nIf you love your son or daughter and want them to be as prepared as possible to be a competent driver this is driving school to choose.  If you&apos;re considering a driving school and your goal [as the parent] is to find a driving school that will teach your teen to drive, in as little time as possible, with as little involvement from you as possible, move along and choose another driving school. Driving MBA doesn&apos;t run their business that way. As the parent of the teen driver, should you choose Driving MBA, you will be required to be involved in the process of helping your teen with practice drive time (approx 100 hours) and reinforce what Driving MBA is teaching your teen about safe driving practices.\\n\\nDriving MBA in my opinion is top notch.  They take the role they have in helping teens become responsible drivers very seriously. Their goal is to teach drivers the rules of the road and to be competent, as well as, learn to drive defensively to avoid accidents and handle unexpected situations that could put the life of your teen and/or others at risk.\\n\\nThe owner and the instructors at Driving MBA have a passion for teaching your teen to be as safe as possible when they are behind the wheel. As the parent of two teen drivers, I don&apos;t take the responsibility of allowing my teens to driving lightly, and I&apos;m thankful that this driving school doesn&apos;t either. Driving MBA expects parents to be engaged, and they expect parents to spend a lot of time with their teens driving (approx 20 hours between each lesson they give your teen). Why so many hours behind the wheel with you before your teen takes their road test?  Because ultimately you are the parent and it is your job to teach your child to be a safe driver.  There is no replacement for for your teen to have real hours of experience behind the wheel with you assisting your teen driver and evaluating their progress before you allow them to take their road test at the MVD.  Driving MBA is a support system in the process of helping your child learning to drive, but ultimately this is your teen learning to drive and you the parent are the one responsible for them being the best possible driver on the road.\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":4,\"reviewCount\":29}}"]},

I am in the Army, so online school is the only real option for me.  GCU portrays itself as a friendly online platform. The user interface and classes are great. However, this is the extent of my praise. GCU made me feel like a second-class student. \\n\\nIn order to take more than two classes, you need to put in an appeal each time which can take weeks to months to get approved, which is too slow and has thrown me off my schedule to graduate in line with my career aspirations. They are guilty of FALSE ADVERTISING. You CAN NOT finish your degree in 2 years online with how long their appeal process takes. I have kept above a 3.8 GPA, so my grades were not a factor in this long process. This appeal system actively sabotages high-achieving, heavy-hitting, motivated students. It sucks your soul, and not in a good way. \\n\\nThe student service counselors are overtasked, and you&apos;ll only get to talk to them on the phone 10-20% of the time you really need it. \\n\\nAdditionally, I have tried to apply to another college in the meantime, and it took over a month for the transcripts to arrive in the mail. But now that I am wrapping up my time with GCU and am shooting for my master&apos;s with Notre Dame, GCU has taken weeks to send the transcript, and it still hasn&apos;t arrived. I have been to five colleges, and GCU is the ONLY ONE THAT DOES NOT SEND ELECTRONIC TRANSCRIPTS, which is utterly absurd in this day and age. The hassle I have to go through to be met where I am by the administration is exhausting. \\n\\nThe transcript department refused to give me credit for two of my transcripts, and the best advice my counselor could give me was to just have them sent again. This creates time and information gaps that amount to weeks because of the time it takes GCU to receive and review them. I wish I could talk to someone in the transcript department so that I could know what the actual issue is. I despise this process and detest that GCU forces me to go through it.\\n\\nYour only point of contact is your student counselor.

We were to articulate how and why we would include Marxist ideas in our teaching practices. The assignment never asked if we agreed with it. We were told to agree with it. We had to explain how we were going to incorporate racist teaching strategies in our classroom.

I actually asked the professor if students are required to lie to earn a good grade in the class. Essentially, those who do not agree are forced to lie to earn a good grade. \\n \\nIn the end, my final score for the class was dropped due to non-compliance and independent thinking; I disagree with the Marxist agenda. I filed a formal review of my grade with the review committee. I asked if the institution had ethical teaching practices. Shall it be acceptable for teachers to demand that students lie in order to pass their classes? Can students get marked down for adhering to ethical or biblical standards? Why should this even be an issue at an institution that claims to be &quot;Christian&quot;? Shall professors ask students to violate the Bible? [Social Justice is not Biblical Justice. See Owen Strachan, Voddie Baucham, John MacArthur, Scott David Allen, Thaddeus Williams, Allie B. Stuckey, and Alisa Childers.]\\n \\nAdditionally, the textbook was awful. It was woke, Marxist indoctrination. I was shocked and saddened that a &quot;Christian&quot; institution would approve of such a divisive, unbiblical textbook. The professor pointed students to Dr. Geneva Gay who advocates for social justice, promotes the teaching of whiteness, and encourages racial division in the classroom. Per the professor, Gay&apos;s framework was a positive example that students were to follow. This is what Christian leaders are supposed to emulate per Grand Canyon University?\\n \\nIf you are curious if the institution still believes in these themes, search for &quot;culturally responsive&quot; in the staff profile page. More than one teacher pops up. You will find these ideas right there on the GCU website. Or, email the academic dean of your area of expertise, ask them specifically if these Marxist ideas are still being taught at GCU (whiteness, white privilege, racial injustice, diversity, inclusion, and equity). \\n \\nIf you are uncertain about Culturally Responsive Teaching, Christopher Rufo released a video on Critical Race Theory and he calls out Culturally Responsive Teaching. PragerU also has a video about education that highlights Culturally Responsive Teaching as well (Miseducation). Within this teaching framework, students are encouraged to express their inner rage about America or people of another color. Teachers are reprogrammed to function as social justice counselors. Students become social justice warriors. \\n \\nSocial Justice is not biblical justice. You can read &quot;Fault Lines&quot; by Voddie Baucham to learn more. Watch a video by Voddie Baucham entitled &quot;Social Justice v. Biblical Justice&quot;. Or, you can read &quot;Why Social Justice is Not Biblical Justice&quot; by Scott David Allen. I also recommend &quot;Christianity and Wokeness&quot; by Owen Strachan. Lastly, read &quot;Confronting Injustice without Compromising Truth: 12 Questions Christians Should Ask About Social Justice&quot; by Thaddeus Williams. These works are helpful to understand the problem addressed here.\\n\\nThe Resolution Team received my thoughts in a 38-page document. They did not actively try to connect with me on the matter.

It was challenging and I did not have overly-supportive professors -- but I finished it quickly and graduated with a GPA just under 4.0. \\n\\nHowever. Post-graduation, GCU&apos;s &quot;customer service&quot; is terrible! I have taught high school 11 years in the west and (because of my husband&apos;s job) have moved to a state on the east coast. In order to get my teaching certificate here, I needed official transcripts from my undergraduate and graduate schools. My undergraduate was at WSU, where I ordered a transcript online in under 2 minutes. GCU is not automated (weird for an online school). The only option is to call and speak to my &quot;advisor.&quot; After being on a lengthy hold, I was told that he was with a student and to leave a message. It took several attempts before I got through to him. I found out after the fact (from him)  that he had been out of town the whole week, yet every time I called student services told me he &quot;was with a student.&quot; After this long delay they then told me they had to MAIL the transcript! I had ordered an electronic transcript just 2 months earlier. I was told that was only because of Covid and they had since stopped doing electronic transcripts. The trouble was -- my application was all digital. All my forms were submitted to a digital application with Dept of Ed. I tried to explain this and was told &quot;no exceptions!&quot; I took it to a supervisor (which took one whole day for him to get back to me) and his position was that the Dept of Ed had to make the exception, not GCU. I had to call my state Dept of Ed to get an address for the mailed transcript. More and more delays. \\n\\nThe transcript was finally sent. Then the Dept of Ed required a verification form to be filled out by the &quot;preparing institution.&quot; So I had to start the process all over again. This time I had to speak with my &quot;counselor.&quot; And OF COURSE she was not available. I left three messages on her VM. Finally, after much pleading GCU allowed me to talk to another counselor, who had me email the form to my counselor of record, saying it would be processed by &quot;the end of the day.&quot; That was three weeks ago!! Nothing. I have called and left messages once a week and emailed her once a week (for three weeks). SHE HAS NOT REPLIED TO A SINGLE MESSAGE OR EMAIL. And she did not send the form. \\n\\nI started my new job 2 weeks ago. The school had to remand me to substitute status: I am paid the sub per diem (significantly less), I cannot have medical benefits, and I do not accrue sick leave. Until the Dept of Ed gets that form. One form is holding everything up! \\n\\nToday I got an email from a completely different counselor, telling me I have to submit an additional form before GCU will send the verification form. On this form I have to confirm that &quot;the state I reside in does not require test scores before issuing a certificate.&quot; But the state does require test scores -- and I have already sent them my test scores. My Praxis, West-E, and West-B test scores have nothing to do with GCU. I didn&apos;t take the tests through GCU, this is not their preview! I am SO frustrated!! I feel like I&apos;m being held hostage by this school. \\n\\nAnd every time I call -- I have to go through the gauntlet with the &quot;student services&quot; (which is a misnomer if I ever heard one -- they are the opposite of service) person BEFORE I can talk to a counselor or advisor. I have to give them my address, my phone number, my social security number, my email address, AND I have to answer a security question. Every. Single. Time. And then I&apos;m put on hold forever. Just to get a voicemail recording. Make an online option available!! It&apos;s 2022!\\n\\nSo, if you&apos;re thinking of attending GCU, because its a nice online option -- be warned! GCU does not care about their students after they graduate.\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":3,\"reviewCount\":367}}"]},

Some parents may still be searching for the &quot;right&quot; school for their young ones, so in light of that, I recommend highly Mission Montessori to any parent with grade school or preschool-aged children.\\n\\n1. During the two years my son attended, I found the teachers to be compassionate and very attentive to my child&apos;s needs. They are well-trained educators, and each day my child shared something new with me that he&apos;d learned that day.\\n2. I found that the communication among the Administration, Staff &amp; Parents was always strong and on point - never lacking.\\n3. I always felt comfortable leaving my son in the hands of Staff at Mission, and he never cried or was upset when I&apos;d check him in each school day. I never worried that he wasn&apos;t being attended to - but was at peace that he&apos;d be cared for.\\n4. If I felt my son was having an &quot;off&quot; day, I always had someone to talk to in the Administration or with his Teachers to discuss, and who were genuinely concerned.\\n5. Each classroom is beautifully appointed for each age/grade with high-quality Montessori materials. That was a very big plus.\\n6. Unfortunately, my son last year had to attend first grade at a public school because we had moved. He entered first grade making all A&apos;s, and I was proud that Mission had prepared my son so well.  My greatest wish is to have another wonderful Mission Montessori near us on the West side of the Valley! Hello, Mission Montessori - did you hear me?\\n7. After this first year at public/traditional school, there is definitely a very big difference in the number of teaching Staff. Traditional schools have 1 teacher to 30-35 students.  Mission Montessori has a 1 to 10 ratio - and there are at least 3 adults in a Primary/Kindergarten classroom. Public/traditional falls short, and our children are the ones who suffer.\\nIn closing, I&apos;ll keep hoping for a Montessori close by to enroll my son in next year. If any parent reading this &quot;rather long note&quot; lives close to a Montessori School, I urge you to send your child/children. Their schools are far above traditional education for young minds.

All 3 of our children started in the preschool program and thrived! We have 2 girls and 1 boy, each child has a unique personality, and different needs and strengths. Mission Montessori was an excellent choice for all of my children because the teachers allow the children to be independent. My children learned at their own pace, when they were interested in a topic (this is called a sensitive period), and with an appropriate amount of structure. My oldest is in 6th grade now and is still thriving! My younger children are in 3rd and 1st grade, sharing the same classroom, on the lower elementary classroom and thriving as well. Many people have a misconception that children in a Montessori school are wandering around all day. I can assure you, that is not the case. There is a purpose to everything the children do, even though many times the children (and even the parents) are unaware. For example, in preschool, the children learn fine motor skills but cutting and pasting pieces of paper, sewing large buttons to make bracelets, etc. They learn large motor skills by washing windows and chairs. Each of these &quot;works&quot; is taught and is executed in a way that children learn to setup, follow simple steps, do things in order from left to right (since we read left to right), and cleanup. The beauty of all of this is the children independently select the work they want to do from the large variety of options. So they are interested in the work they are doing and are learning in the process. When they reach kindergarten age, the children have workplans and they must complete academic work (math and language) before they move onto other works in the classroom. But the children select the order in which they complete the academic work, so they maintain their independence. If a child is ever struggling on how to proceed, the teacher will make appropriate suggestions. In addition to the classroom work, the children have gardening where they learn about natures and planting with thoughtful lessons and hands-on work (the children plant and harvest the garden.) This is our 8th year at Mission Montessori and I am still amazed each time I am in the classroom at how focused the children are and how much they quietly collaborate with each other. The older children take pride in helping the younger children. The teachers are caring, dedicated, knowledgable, and simply phenomenal. Each of my children is different and it was absolutely the right choice for all of them. They all excel in math and language and have a love of learning.\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":5,\"reviewCount\":7}}"]},

I am someone who has previously studied a Japanese martial art (shotokan). So I know something about karate. First of all let me say that Master Maui is a very personable, friendly and all around great person. On top of that, he knows how to teach. That is very important. I was looking for a martial arts studio that taught real life self defense and fighting techniques. It&apos;s a dangerous world out there. Most martial arts studios don&apos;t teach real life combat skills. As a child my son studied Taekwondo. While that was fun, it didn&apos;t really teach fighting skills. Most high level belts of that school couldn&apos;t fight their way out of wet paper bag. Krav Maga is popular today because of this very fact. It emerged to teach real fighting skills where traditional martial arts faltered. Now, let&apos;s talk about Saito Ninjitsu - It is Krav Maga on steroids. Much, much more. I started studying with Master Maui after my son, now a police officer, had been studying with him a few years. My son has tried some of the techniques taught here on me. And frankly, he has put me in more pain than I have ever experienced in my life (and I&apos;m a big strong guy). These techniques really work and every police officer should attend his law enforcement classes for their own safety. I have learned some, well, brutal techniques that would disable any attacker. I have no desire to break anyone&apos;s bones, but in a bad situation, I might have to. Master Maui also teaches realistic blocking techniques. Much better than my former Shotokan blocks. Oh, and speaking of Master Maui, how often do you get the chance to train with a true Master? It&apos;s actually pretty rare. Another advantage of Saito Ninjitsu is the fact that I can control someone with very workable locking techniques. In other martial arts you basically punch and kick your way to victory over an opponent. Hopefully your opponent is not too big or he&apos;s not a better puncher than you. I&apos;d rather, throw some quick counter attacks, then lock him up and hold him for the police. As you would expect, any ancient Japanese martial art has a spiritual component to it. I have to say, that is a very intriguing aspect of Saito Ninjitsu as well.\"},{\"author\":\"Scott G.\",\"datePublished\":\"2012-10-25\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"I am not one to post a lot of reviews, and when I do I am brutally honest. So with that in mind, I have to say that Maui Saito Ninjitsu is by far the best and most unique program I have ever seen. My 7 year old has been doing it for just under a year and loves it. It is not your typical program where the kids stand in rows and practice moves of katas. Master Maui teaches them unique skills that would help them if ever caught in a bad situation. The kids are having so much fun that they don&apos;t even realize they are getting a valuable lesson. They are also learning how to focus when there is distraction and get out of dangerous situations. You kind of have to see it for yourself to truly get an understanding of it. On top of that, some of the moves they learn are amazing.. It doesn&apos;t matter how small you are for Ninjitsu to be effective. I have seen my 7 year old take down a kid who is twice his size and weight. It is certainly a great confidence builder and a way for kids to deal with bullies if ever put in the situation.\\n\\nNow on to Master Maui... I can sincerely say he is one of the nicest people I have ever met and  his dojo like a big family. He is great with the kids and a fantastic teacher to say the least. You can tell he truly cares about the kids and loves what he does. He was taught Ninjitsu by his father in Hawaii, you can read the unique history on his website. \\n\\nAs I said, it is the kind of thing you have to see to fully get an understanding of it. I guarantee it is not like anything you have ever seen. We found it by chance when looking at different schools that were close to home. I am certainly glad we did and have no doubt my son will stick with it. I honestly can&apos;t say enough good things about the school or Master Maui...

He seemed very educated and enthusiastic that this class will change my child.   He stated that my child had some movement issues and he knew the perfect instructor for my child for this class. \\n\\n4 sessions (1 hour long):  Effective us of a Daily Planner; Taking Notes based on the Student&apos;s Learning Style; Memorization and Research Techniques; and, Prepping for Tests. Many students will continue with regularly scheduled homework support or subject tutoring.\\n\\nScheduling the sessions:  I called and scheduled the classes, all 4 of them.  They asked when it was convenient for me to bring him in.  I thought this was strange because Dave said he had a specific person for him, but maybe this person is always available, so I let it go.  I schedule two days for the first week, then two days for the second week.  I am not sure if we did all 4 session consecutively if it would have been any better. Probably not.\\n\\nSession 1-Plan of attack)  My child states that he sat at a very large table with many other instructors and many students, all in the same room.  To me this is a distraction -- not a good place for a child who is easily distracted.   I have no idea if my child got the instructor that Dave was referring to, but what can I do? This is also the session where they learn how to fill out the planner properly.  He says he took notes, filled out a worksheet and made a contract. \\n\\nSession 2-Taking Notes) I purchased the planner before this class, in hopes that it would make a difference.  My child states that he didn&apos;t learn anything new.  He also stated that a child complained for a long time about the classes they are taking and it was very annoying.  After session two, SEC asked for credentials for school login, to view grades, etc.\\n\\nSession 3-Research) My child admits to me that he only fills out the planner before going to his session at SEC so he won&apos;t get in trouble.  He tells me he is learning stuff that he already knows (easy bib).  Looking at his grades now, after three sessions (no improvement).  Still doing the same things.\\n\\nSession 4-Test Taking / Study Skills) Same thing, my child admits to me he still hasn&apos;t learned anything new.\\n\\nThis class did absolutely NOTHING for him.  After taking the classes, he is still doing the same things.  Big waste of money!    \\n\\nPersonally, I feel.... these changes could benefit S.E.C.\\n1st... I feel....This class should included the PLANNER that they teach to.  It&apos;s $10, just make the class $10 more expensive. I found out after the first session that it was NOT included.  I had to ask for it personally.  Nobody even asked me if we wanted it before the class. \\n\\n2nd... I feel....they should teach this class on a regular schedule, with the same kids, not a revolving schedule .  Meaning it should be offered weekly or bi-monthly option, like a scheduled class.  As for now, each class can have up to 3 students and not always the same 3 students.  I&apos;m not sure how the kids sit with one another, but to me this seems like it can be very distracting for a kid who is unfocused.  My child told me during one session, a kid complained how hard a specific class was for them and they discussed it for 30 minutes - How will this organize/help my child? \\n\\n3rd... I feel....The logon credentials should be asked for on the first day of class.  When they looked at my child&apos;s grades,   They sent me a report stating that they looked at my child&apos;s &quot;School Website&quot; classes/grades.  The report just stated the obvious, which was happening BEFORE we went there and I already knew about.\\n\\nI feel....If you don&apos;t know what is wrong with your child because you are clueless (haven&apos;t check grades, aren&apos;t around when child is supposed to be doing school work or have no time to figure it out), then maybe this class is for your child, otherwise, save your money.\"},{\"author\":\"Pam K.\",\"datePublished\":\"2016-06-03\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"I checked out 3 other establishments in the valley before my son &amp; I settled on SEC.

Our son needed SAT prep as well as a tutor for Algebra III.  We were hoping for 1-on-1 tutoring for some sessions, but the 1-on-1 turned out to be one tutor and one student in a room filled with other tutors and students, all talking at once.  Our son has 3 mild learning differences, dyslexia, ADHD and auditory processing.  While in the office to pay our bill, I mentioned to the receptionist that our son had taken one of the SAT prep tests with a lot of other talking &amp; lessons going on in the background, and that this was distracting for him, as he had several learning differences.  She immediately asked me to whisper about it.  What?  I have never been asked to talk about my children&apos;s learning disabilities in hushed tones.  It was as if that was a taboo subject to discuss in the office, even though there were only two other adults present, and they appeared to be staff.  Wow!!!  I have raised 4 children, 3 of whom are dyslexic and so am I.  I have never been uncomfortable or embarrassed to talk about learning differences.  Nor should anyone else.  I have raised my children to know themselves, strengths and struggles in all, to advocate for themselves and to understand that having a learning disability does not limit them in anyway!!!!  In fact, my kids are capable of anything, and have amazing gifts in the areas of music, art, English (yes!!!), sports, science and technology.  I have taught at some of the most amazing and prominent public and private schools, and never have I been &quot;shushed&quot; when it came to openly and honestly asking for what a child needs.  If this is a place that is testing children as well, I would definitely look elsewhere!  Look for a place that truly understand learning differences, gifts and struggles in all, and are not embarrassed to talk about it.  And look for a place where 1-on-1 is just that, in a quite space with few distractions.\"},{\"author\":\"Jennifer K.\",\"datePublished\":\"2014-03-04\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"Our son was taking the entrance exam to a private school and had never done a timed test.

So before you take this too seriously, let me remind you that this is a Yelp review. That being said, I&apos;d love to come out of retirement for this review and talk about something that I&apos;ve cared so deeply about ever since I joined Greek Life, in the time before twitter. Lame ik.. \\n\\nFirst, I highly recommend going Greek no matter what your age is. But before you do, know that there is a standard you must meet. The school will tell you that you need a minimum GPA of 2.5 in college or in High School (if you&apos;re an incoming freshman). But lets be real, if you&apos;re coming out of HS with a GPA between a 2.5 &amp; 2.8 you need to seriously consider establishing a solid GPA for a semester or two before you join. Now for the part they won&apos;t talk about during recruitment.. You need to be a person of solid character and moral judgment. In life you&apos;re going to be put in awkward situations that you&apos;re not always going to have a good answer for. But you don&apos;t have to be a rocket scientist to know the difference between good and bad. You&apos;ll learn proper etiquette later and will mold in to the person you were meant to be as you get older. That&apos;s life. \\n\\nNow who doesn&apos;t love sorority rush?? I&apos;ll be quick and to the point. As a whole, sororities at ATU need to use more glitter and the Campus Rush video needs a serious overhaul. The music in the video is comparable to Nickelback playing at a Chuck E Cheese venue. (Cringe) Now I understand the school wants to come off as a safe and conservative place for students. But seriously? Ew. My experience with sororities has been excellent. Something about southern ladies helping the community and being leaders on campus is a thing of beauty. (To my knowledge the Panhellenic Council is a secret society of robe wearers who all carry gavels) Idk I&apos;ve never been to one of their meetings, it&apos;s just what I&apos;ve heard.\\n\\nFor the men in Greek Life, I&apos;ll make this super short and hopefully you&apos;ll get something out of it:\\nYou&apos;re born male, You grow in to a man, and you choose to be a gentleman. You can be cool and interact with everyone on campus without having to act insecure.

We hire a HVAC contractor to perform our basic maintenance, which we should be able to perform in house. I had a very limited knowledge of HVAC and decided to take the AC and Refrigeration class from Ultimate Tech Academy. I attend up to three classes a year in various fields to benefit my employer as well as myself. I have been doing different training for over eight years. Ultimate Tech Academy is the most beneficial training that I have ever been through. They had multiple trainers in the five days that I was there, which had various different backgrounds that made the training easier to understand. I could not believe the amount of hands on equipment that they had to train the students on. There was two HVAC classes going on when I was there, which had around 20 students total. There was plenty of equipment for everyone to work on without standing around. This is not a class that you should take if you want your employer to pay for a free vacation. Our classes started at 8:00 am and we did not get out until after 5:00 pm. They also require homework at night. I decided to take the NATE CORE &amp; NATE HEAT PUMP tests, which of course added more homework time to each of my nights. After Ultimate Tech Academy&apos;s class I was able to pass the NATE CORE and missed passing the NATE HEAT PUMP test by a couple questions. For me to be able to do so well on the two NATE tests with only one week of training as well as very little HVAC experience is amazing in my opinion.

I signed up for a B2 Deutschkurs because my other school (AGI) was full. During the sign up process they told me that I would have to take a placement test. So I asked the secretary if I would get my money back if I didn&apos;t pass the test (or if I wasn&apos;t issued my visa), and she said yes of course. So I sent them the 730\u20ac in good faith and got my visa extended. A few weeks later I took the test, and leaving I felt very confident that I had done well. We would see the results on that Friday.\\nSo my friend who had also taken the test with them goes before me on Friday. He texts me that he had not enough points and they told him that they WOULD NOT be able to give him his money back and he would have to retake B1 with them! They told him that if he wanted to take B2 he could maybe attend the first 3 or 4 days of class and if he was able to keep up they would allow him to continue. These were his only options!\\nSo I was very concerned that they would tell me something similar. I was preparing to demand my money back because I had just finished taking B1 and did very well in the class at AGI. So I rushed over there and asked for my scores. They told me that I also had not scored enough and that I had to retake B1 with them. I asked if I could do the same as my friend and try to attend the first few days and see from there. They told me no! I said they offered it to my friend and they told me his score was probably better than mine but for me it was not possible. Later I found out we had the SAME EXACT SCORE. I said there was no way I am going to retake B1 because I just spent two months doing B1 and how am I supposed to afford this?! These courses are not cheap! After a while of talking to the secretary they agreed to give me some of my money back, but they will charge a 50\u20ac fee! Remember, earlier I had asked specifically if I would be able to get my money back and they said that would be no problem! No one mentioned I would have to argue with them for my money or anything about a fee!\\nI told my friend that I got my money back and so he was very pissed that they didn&apos;t do the same for him. He went back and got his, but he was also charged this 50\u20ac. We both signed up for classes at AGI and there was no arbitrarily graded test and none of this drama! They also let us go to the course even though we couldn&apos;t pay until IFA finally sent the money back! Very nice of AGI!\\nLong story short, they gave us each completely different information on two counts - firstly that I could get my money back and he couldn&apos;t, and secondly that he could try out the first few days and I couldn&apos;t, despite having the same scores. I don&apos;t know what this is about! If we hadn&apos;t been friends and been able to compare our experiences, we would both have been screwed! I don&apos;t know why they are telling people different info, deceiving me by saying there would be no problems getting the money back. All I can say is they want to force some to retake a lower level with them so you end up studying with them longer and they make more money! Not cool!\\nIf anyone is looking for a great language school without any of this drama, I can highly recommend AGI (Anglo German Institute). They are great, friendly, and flexible!

Unfortunately, this discovery method only works when a student is already very self-driven and/or has access to very thoughtful, innovative teachers; ISS is bereft of the latter, which is why ISS students easily struggle in math and language learning.  For instance, rather than develop individualized learning plans to help students tackle their math and/or language challenges, ISS teachers will instead steer parents towards private tutoring services.\\n\\nPros of ISS: Although ISS&apos;s community of active parents is small, it is still impressively effective and most likely the reason why ISS continues to remain operational; it has some very caring and kind teachers and staff members, who truly care about the kids; it offers students a unique opportunity to become bilingual and/or trilingual, both through class learning and through immersion trips into neighboring towns; it provides numerous after school programs and a number of overnight school trips to &quot;facilitate holistic learning&quot;; and ISS works hard to build a community of compassionate, tolerant, and open-minded citizens by teaching their students how to appreciate, communicate, and interact with people from different cultures and from other countries.\\n\\nCons of ISS: ISS lacks visionaries; it is more reactive than proactive in its strategic and financial planning; many of its managing staff and teachers fail to understand the importance of providing students with strong foundational preparation, especially when it comes to math; lack of a focus on laying foundational knowledge has resulted in many kids falling behind and/or repeating a grade level, once they return to their home countries (most prevalent concern among non-German parents); the principals and teachers are slow at best to respond to your inquiries, unless forced to do so; and there is an absence of accountability for students, which, to be fair, is first and foremost up to the parents to address - but that doesn&apos;t mean that ISS should continue to set expectations without consequences, as well.\\n\\nMy husband and I still believe the IB program has great potential and merit, but we do not feel that ISS (Degerloch or Sindelfingen) has done all that it can to effectively execute it.\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":2.5,\"reviewCount\":3}}"]},

The staff/students were friendly, but not professional at all. So much gossiping, joking around, singing and basically I felt like I was just one of those mannequin heads they practice on. Seems like the students should be taught when you make a mistake you don&apos;t announce it for all to hear but instead go find your instructor and quietly tell them what you did wrong. It doesn&apos;t make the customer feel confident about the service they are receiving. The young lady that first introduced herself to me was very sweet but really unsure of herself which is understandable. There were two students working on coloring my hair and neither had a clue as to what they were doing. The instructor left them to their own devices and when she did come back she had to take over because the bleach had been on for quite a while and she had to correct their mistakes. I don&apos;t really blame the students because they didn&apos;t really seem to have a lot of instruction. It took over four hours for them to do my hair and since they were closing they didn&apos;t get to the cut. The color didn&apos;t achieve what was intended but I didn&apos;t really expect it to. But I am pleased with the results. The instructor seems to know her stuff and ended up doing the majority of my color. I would say the main thing I was disappointed in was the lack of professionalism.\"},{\"author\":\"T W.\",\"datePublished\":\"2015-04-22\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":2},\"description\":\"I used to like coming here, but I am very disappointed with the service received when trying to make an appointment. Basically the young lady who answered the phone says you can just come in and find out, there may or may not be someone who can perform your services. I am not going to waste a trip for a maybe. I understand systems may be down, but to tell me you&apos;re in the back and can not see who is on the floor does not help at all. I would not have minded to be placed on hold while she checked. It would be so much easier for her to go find out then for me to make a trip only to be turned away. The guest is not at fault because the system is down and should not be punished. Good guest services is very important and I did not receive that. I contacted the school to report what took place and was told that the Sales Leader would contact me.

I got there at 4 since my event was at 7 giving me plenty of time to get home and dressed, I thought! \\n I got there at 4, seated around 4:15. I should have seen the writing in the wall when the girl started washing my hair. She had no idea what she was doing and was killing me by pulling my hair! Everyone one around me was getting a head massage and I&apos;m trying not to cry! \\n I&apos;ll try to make this short...when she FINALLY got my hair brushed out she grabbed the blow-dryer. She had a comb and was combing my hair straight down and holding the dryer at the crown of my head straight down. Burning the &amp;@$! Out of my scalp. I finally stopped her, asked her if she had a round roll brush and showed her how to do it! She still wasn&apos;t getting it. I finally asked if she could get someone else to finish since it was by the 6:00!\\nA director or somebody did finish it and I got out of there about 6:20 and had to rush to try and make it home and to my event. Worst part? It cost me more than what I&apos;ve paid at salons! I was peeved from the experience and the cost. \\n Another experience was I took my sis-in-law who&apos;s on a strict budget for a haircut. Her girl was good but didn&apos;t listen to her and cut all her hair off. I knew she wasn&apos;t listening to us. We told her several times, no length cut off! It was above her shoulders. \\n So while happy-scissors was cutting my sis-in-laws hair they kept trying to talk me into a service. Against my better judgment I let them do a pedicure. I couldn&apos;t believe I got the same girl again! Blow-out girl! Needless to say. Same situation more or less. Nothing like a pedicure I&apos;ve had before.

Of course, but it&apos;s hard at SPA. They hard sell you on services and products from the first phone call till you get out the door. Calling to book an appointment for a color? Be prepared to get pressured to get an &quot;extra conditioning shot&quot; for $7, or a &quot;shot&quot; for hair that&apos;s straightened or blown dry excessively.  (BTW services are slightly higher than what&apos;s listed on their website). Before coloring, they want to sell you on a &quot;stripping&quot; shampoo service to remove all the products from your hair so the color will adhere better. Don&apos;t forget the Redkin shampoo, conditioner and styling products they use then try and push on you to buy before leaving. In addition to the services, I was asked to participate in a bake sale, buy tickets for a fashion/hair show at $10 a pop, and to buy tickets for a Lyme disease fundraiser for coupons for discount services. The sales part was exhausting and just by the sheer volume of sales pitches, they know you are going to be worn down. \\nThe services were ok (I had an all over color), but took twice as long as at your regular salon due to needing to get an &quot;educator&quot; to come check their work at every interval. I definitely spent less money than at my regular colorist, but the time services took and sales pressure definitely took away from my experience here.\"},{\"author\":\"Louis B.\",\"datePublished\":\"2016-07-01\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"I have been going to SPAS for many years.

I had filled out a parent form and was returning it to the teacher, she had it in her hand, another child snatched the paper from her hands, she went to snatch it back and he went with the paper and hit his head on the cabinet. He whined, and she says &quot;You&apos;re fine. Get up&quot;. I was shocked.\\n\\n-I went in to pay our dues on my lunch break one day at 2:30 in the afternoon. I walked in the front door, no one was in the lobby, no one was in the play room(lights off) no adult in sight except teachers in the classroom, I went and stood at my child&apos;s class door for about 15 minutes, watching. Finally when I walked back to the front, the front desk lady walks out from kitchen(on her lunch)... Doors were unlockedand no one watching the front to see who enters or leaves. With today&apos;s society, intruders are common... saftey procaution not taken. Unsettling.\\n\\n-New Generation assured me when my child started that they check the list to see who is allowed to pick up child, check their ID&apos;s, and are to be signed in &amp; out each day. My child&apos;s aunt was picking him up for the first time, no one was at the front desk once again, but the owner was playing her her grandchildren in the floor not acknowledging she was there. I told her how to get to my child&apos;s class. No one was there to tell her to sign my child out, no one checked the list OR her ID, when she walked to the room  to get my child, (my child is too young to speak), the teacher asked her if she was there to pick up my child, she said yes and began to pull out her ID, the teacher says &quot;I don&apos;t need to see that, he wouldn&apos;t have came to you if he didnt know you&quot; (My child is friendly and goes to anyone)...So they will let anyone pick up my child just because they say they are???\\n\\n-Paperwork I filled out for registration, under allergies, I put &quot;NO JUICE&quot; hes allergic to juice. My child&apos;s bottom turns red, blisters, and will bleed...my child&apos;s stools are liquid, and seems to upset his belly. Inside my child&apos;s cubby at New Generation, on a paper in the back of it, in bold letters, says &quot;NO JUICE&quot;. During my child&apos;s school Christmas party I came, my child was just finishing a bottle of NON diluted Apple Juice. By the time we got home, bottom was blistered, raw, and bleeding. I was so upset. I messaged my child&apos;s teacher and said &quot;If you don&apos;t mind, NO more juice please&quot;... she replies with &quot;I&apos;m sorry, I forgot&quot;...\\n\\n- Floors are disgusting, smells like pee, my childs socks were completely black on bottom from running about 5 yards across the floor at Christmas party while I was changing my child&apos;s diaper, putting his shoes and clothes back on . I asked if they shampoo the carpet. Teacher says &quot;No just vaccuum and sweep.&quot; She also agreed that they were nasty. Filthy enviornment, in and out of the ER &amp; hospital every other week.

It&apos;s great to see growth.  I&apos;m going to give an un-biased report:\\n\\nI scored around a 2300 through prepping here, back when the &quot;new&quot; SAT was new.  I took the SAT once on my own and prepped through 2 more SATs here, and after prepping with them, obtained a perfect score on the Writing.  I also ACT-prepped here twice and got a 34 (out of 36).\\n\\nThe Academy helped plan my academic path early on and naturally, I used their college prep services, and got into Columbia University, University of Chicago, Northwestern, Georgetown, etc (oddly enough, I was waitlisted at University of Washington in St. Louis, though lol).  It came down to Columbia and Northwestern, but I ended up going to NU.\\n\\nOne thing I must emphasize about their college prep program is that it is truly comprehensive.  Like, they help you from A to Z and beyond.  Their philosophy is &quot;Let me help you get your kid into his/her Harvard,&quot; but they don&apos;t stop there.  They aggressively focus on scholarships.  I got a full ride merit-scholarship into Northwestern (whereas, ivy league schools don&apos;t usually give scholarships but are great with financial aid if you need a lot of it).  So, at first, I was a bit sad not to go to Columbia, but in the end and looking back, I was really pleased that I walked out of college debt-free AND got a stellar education.\\n(P.S.- back in the day, Columbia was ranked #9 and Northwestern was #11, so it made little difference ranking-wise where I chose to go.  In 2013, Columbia is at #4).\\n\\nSo, even though I may SOUND biased, I mean, I did walk out with fantastically improved scores, a fantastic college prep package, and got into my absolute top choice schools.  I got results--and not just any, but the ones I wanted.\\nI am not writing this because I work here, or because I was asked to.  I try to be a very honest person in life, and I would never have chosen to work here if I didn&apos;t think their services or philosophy was up to par.  The truth is, I decided to teach here because I agree with the philosophy and practices.  They truly care about education and each student.  I&apos;ve seen the founders help less privileged students by writing off hours and giving them scholarships, and I saw them do this before the company became bigger--usually the time of initial &quot;company growth&quot; is not the time most business people act so generous.  They&apos;re not in it for the money, they&apos;re in it because education makes the world a better place.  Their kids both went to phenomenal undergraduate and graduate programs but are working/will be working in the public service sector.\\n\\nTrust me, and not just because I work here (though, it should encourage you to come, as I did score in the 99% and am one of their best tutors), if you are passionate about your education and being/becoming successful, you want to be here.  There is no other place you&apos;d personally want to be, or send your kid.

Her tone, her facial expression and the words she used was like a kid in major trouble by a parent. She made her feel like the worst driver she had ever seen and seemed pissed. Then she says she passed and she seemed pissed that she passed. She even looked at me at one point and said &quot;did she learn this from you because you need to pay attention to what your teaching&quot;.

I completely agree with going over mistakes in detail and assuring kids know how serious and dangerous driving is... but this was horrible. She has absolutely no people skills at all and obviously no training in communication skills. Trust me, it&apos;s possible to deliver a point without treating people like crap. My daughter cried for at least half hour afterwords and stayed in the car crying instead of going in to tell her dad she passed the test. We are not stupid people. Trust me we would have gone home and talked further about her mistakes and gave her more training. She did not deserve to have someone talk to her like that.

AMAZING! First of all the campus is eco-friendly, the school has a wind power, solar panels, water storage, and many features of the building are up to date and unique. Lovely campus that was one of the winners for a 2012 school architecture and design award ( the other school that won is in Washington state). The arts program is stellar with students learning various instruments and art techniques, including participating in art competitions, and having art classes mevery week during school. Students also get long and multiple electives which include dance classes and vocal lessons. The school has apparently been used in movies and the school has many shows preformed on there three school stages. There is a large piano lab, computer lab, and library that students may use throughout their week. Chinese program is great. My kindergartener learned Chinese words for different foods, colors, numbers through 20, and three Chinese songs in the first two months of school! The whole school gets to celebrate Chinese holidays including moon festival and Chinese New Year with crafts and food. Academics are extraordinary as always. A lot of people refer to this school as a specialty school because of how great it is. It also has a nice running track and playground that lets kids explore. Rsa has yearly theme days that focus on different history topics including ancient civilizations and the renaissance where kids get to dress up and do crafts and field activities themed toward that. There is a strict no bullying policy and teachers are kind and funny to adults and kids.

If you want to know the Juneau area, take incredible pictures and have an epic adventure, then Peter is the person you are looking for. We had an awesome time adventuring and taking pictures with Peter. He made us feel like we were adventuring and learning with a friend. Peter is knowledgeable and helpful. He went out of his way to make us feel at home in Juneau, including drying wet hiking boots! While I have a strong understanding of photography, I learned an incredible amount from Peter, who also took the time to help with some photo editing. My wife, who is a beginner photographer, also learned a great deal from Peter, who was extremely patient. She learned how to set up her camera, how to feel more confident with some of the technical aspects of the camera, and how to create artistic composition. Peter is excellent with photographers and adventurers of all levels. We walked away from our adventure with some outstanding photos to document our adventure, as well as a new friend. \\n\\nThank you Peter, for your guidance and hospitality. The next time we are in Juneau, we plan to book another adventure.

The building itself is located at the south end of the University Center, a strange place for a college campus since I remember this place as a kid in the 80&apos;s with a movie theater, Waldenbooks, a huge video game arcade lined up next to the theater, and a hot dog place down the hall. The wide hallways where stores like Musicland and other shops resided 20 years ago are now replaced with chairs and tables on both sides of the hallway for studying on your laptop or reading textbooks. A campus convenience store that sells snacks, espresso drinks, and UAA t-shirts is located at the old Round Table Pizza location. This campus is convenient to the Pepperoncini Deli next door where I go to have lunch from time to time and they will give discounts for any students who come in with the proper student ID. \\nThe layout is spacious and wide open. Concentrating on studying is no issue with this place as the atmosphere is very quiet and relaxing with only a few students, school personnel, and people doing walking exercises roaming the hallways. It is never crowded and I like the fact that the Wi-Fi is strong and fast everywhere on campus. The school has also provided countless computer stations for students who don&apos;t have laptops. The reason I put this at three stars rather than four is the indifference and aloofness of some of the staff there if you have any questions. A couple of the staff members may be visibly impatient or annoyed if you have questions on how to register properly at the Pearson Center for testing or at the main info desk as if students should already know what to do even if it&apos;s their first time there.\\nAside from that, they have a spacious testing center that isn&apos;t cramped with a decent amount of personal space for students. Lockers for personal items like cell phones, wallets, watches, or school papers are provided at the sign-in desk as none of these are allowed into the center that would help you in any way when taking a test. Available classrooms on campus are plentiful and I have never seen those rooms crowded like the main campus whenever I&apos;m here. There is never an issue with parking and this is another good option for studying if the coffee shops I go to are packed with no place to sit.\"},{\"author\":\"K.

She was rude and didn&apos;t offer any information and when I asked what to bring she was condescending like I was an idiot for asking. But my coworker assured me that she was just the grumpy receptionist and the guys doing the tests are great. Well to my disbelief, she also does road tests. First of all my daughter has been practicing for two years and she was doing really great for a newer driver before the test; nailed her parallel parking with me and everything. When she got back, she took us into the office and immediately started talking down to my daughter like she was an idiot. Her tone, her facial expression and the words she used was like a kid in major trouble by a parent. She made her feel like the worst driver she had ever seen and seemed pissed. Then she says she passed and she seemed pissed that she passed. She even looked at me at one point and said &quot;did she learn this from you because you need to pay attention to what your teaching&quot;. I have no accident... no tickets and always obey the laws excuse me very much. She ended with saying &quot; you better not ever hit me because I will remember you&quot;. It was worse but hard to describe all. She never congratulated her for passing or told her the things she is good at. I completely agree with going over mistakes in detail and assuring kids know how serious and dangerous driving is... but this was horrible. She has absolutely no people skills at all and obviously no training in communication skills. Trust me, it&apos;s possible to deliver a point without treating people like crap. My daughter cried for at least half hour afterwords and stayed in the car crying instead of going in to tell her dad she passed the test. We are not stupid people. Trust me we would have gone home and talked further about her mistakes and gave her more training. She did not deserve to have someone talk to her like that. She was so stressed by this lady during her test that I&apos;m honestly surprised she made it through. Shame on you for allowing someone like her to represent your business. And btw, I have friends that I talked to that worked with her and that lady is horrible and was fired from other positions for the way she treats people and the amount of complains received about her. Her coworkers also couldn&apos;t handle how she talked down to them. I hope she doesn&apos;t ruin your good name.\"},{\"author\":\"Bella P.\",\"datePublished\":\"2018-11-13\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":4},\"description\":\"I took the driving course back in August and was very satisfied with the instruction I received during the course.

They really liked Butch and the other instructors. However, I can&apos;t recommend them because of Lynette, who works in the office and also administers road tests. She is rude, unprofessional and disorganized. My 17 year old took his test with her, and although he passed, she spent 15 minutes berating him for his mistakes. She didn&apos;t recommend areas where he could improve, she just talked down to him. I was standing right there and finally could see he was shutting down and had to intervene and ask her to just give him the results and leave him alone. His results weren&apos;t in the computer when we went to the DMV to get his license (although she insisted they would be) and we had to wait while they called her. I recently had a coworker tell me of a similar experience his daughter had with Lynette while taking her test there. I witnessed her speak to people on the phone while I was in the office and she was rude and dismissive. My older son had difficulty setting up his driving test because she was so disorganized and unhelpful. Driving lessons are not cheap and Be Smart are the most expensive in town. I have friends asking for recommendations for their kids but I will tell them to steer clear as long as Lynette works there.\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":2.5,\"reviewCount\":14}}"]},

Even though it has been many years, so long as they are still following the same catechistic editions, then they are still following the same &quot;gays shall be stoned&quot; philosophy. Bottom line: it is a Lutheran school. I attended this school from pre-school through 8th grade. My parents regret sending my brother and I here. They were extremely homophobic, conservative and will never truly understand how much they harmed me emotionally, mentally, and physically. For years I kept this secret, thinking my parents would disown me, I&apos;d be kicked out of school, I&apos;d be tormented by classmates. After being told &quot;God does not associate with homosexuals,&quot; I prayed to God for hours before bed to &quot;take away my homosexuality so I don&apos;t burn in hell.&quot; I now understand why God didn&apos;t do so: he made me this way and loves me the way I am. Of course, the principle and teachers will tell you (as they did the entire classroom), &quot;That&apos;s just an excuse for gays&apos; sinful behavior. Being LGBTQ is a choice!&quot;  This was the turning point to where I went through hell on earth because of this school and their teachings. I resorted to drugs, self-harm, dangerous behavior, and hated the world, my classmates, my teachers--and most of all--myself. After all these years, it still hurts because I believed in their idea of God and believed what the principle and teachers told me (and made me memorize), &quot;If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.&quot; We now know that this verse has been reconstructed over centuries to fit the archaic judgements of men; we now know there is very strong evidence of editorial intervention in all homophobic verses in the Bible. We now know that God loves everyone and blessed you with the gift of life in the way that you are. A teacher also once grabbed me by the neck. She quickly realized she made a terrible decision. She never faced any discipline for it. If that happened in today&apos;s world, she would&apos;ve faced disciplinary action. There was another teacher who would talk about Jesus and then swear and curse up a storm at recess. All of these ratings are from parents, none from them are from children who attended. I know others who were taken out of this school to be homeschooled. My brother blames it for a lot of his problems and I think he is justified in it. Opinions were expressed as incontrovertible fact in the classroom environment: &apos;God support&apos;s the death penalty,&apos; for example. I was severely bullied by my classmates who called me &quot;girly,&quot; &quot;fag,&quot; &quot;gay,&quot; &quot;homo,&quot; and many harmful words that were never really addressed by the teachers in charge. I feel sorry for any LGBTQ student here and if you&apos;re reading this, know that Jesus loves you and to never be afraid to be yourself. One thing you don&apos;t want to do is stay in the closet as it will only continue to harm you. Talk to your parents. Tell them what is being shoved down your throat for memory work and in class. Don&apos;t be afraid to tell your classmates that God made you in your own special way. Stick up for yourself. Talk to your school counselor (if there even is one; there wasn&apos;t when I went here). And if it is ruining your education and mental health, you need to get out of there. I now am a social work major and successful public service officer after many years of torment and soul searching.\"},{\"author\":\"nicole d.\",\"datePublished\":\"2017-12-11\",\"reviewRating\":{\"ratingValue\":5},\"description\":\"We love this school!

We were two of four people on the excursion and had FAR less photography experience than the other two people on the tour. Our photo guide Eva was incredible, patient, and an amazing teacher. She taught us how to take amazing photos on the phones that we brought. At no point during discussions of lighting, framing, color, and shutter speed did we feel neglected or talked down to, both of which are easy to do when teaching a mix of novices and and experienced amateurs. We came away from the excursion with some of the most amazing photos of our trip and the memory of an incredible end to the best day of our Alaskan vacation. I cannot recommend Denali Photo Guides, and our guide Eva in particular, enough.\"}],\"aggregateRating\":{\"@type\":\"AggregateRating\",\"ratingValue\":5,\"reviewCount\":1}}"]},
